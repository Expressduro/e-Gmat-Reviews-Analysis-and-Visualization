*Word Problems Section Hard question are much more difficult and time consuming than what is tested suggest to lower difficulty or mix in less difficult problems that can be completed in around three minutes compared to the excessive questions with four or five minute median solving timesI used e-GMAT to improve my GMAT score from 605 to 675, achieving Q87, V84, and DI80. The program’s modular study approach and data-driven analytics were standout features, enabling me to track my progress and feel in control throughout my preparation. I also appreciated the live sessions and weekly coffee chats, which broke the monotony of studying and kept me motivated with valuable tips.

After trying several prep companies’ free trials, I chose e-GMAT for its user-friendly, data-oriented interface. The course’s structured progression was especially helpful, starting with foundational skills and building up to timing efficiency. I began with the verbal section, improving from the 70th percentile to the 90th percentile in just three weeks—a remarkable feat given my past struggles with reading comprehension in exams like the SAT.

The program’s verbal-first approach provided a strong foundation that helped me tackle quantitative and data interpretation (DI) sections more effectively. The question analytics were another highlight, offering detailed insights on accuracy, timing, and score distributions. This feature allowed me to identify patterns in my mistakes and boosted my confidence when I saw that some challenging questions were difficult for others too.

While the course was transformative, certain sections—particularly word problems—felt excessively challenging. Although this built mental endurance and made actual exam questions easier, it also caused stress during preparation. I’d recommend students manage their expectations and remember that perfection isn’t always necessary.

Overall, e-GMAT provided a systematic, supportive, and effective approach to GMAT preparation. Its structured modules, detailed feedback, and engaging community played a key role in my improvement, equipping me with the skills and confidence to achieve my target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. Last Mile Program (LMP) & Mentorship
LMP assigned me a dedicated mentor who provided a customized study plan and personally tracked my progress throughout the journey. Honestly, having such a mentor made decision-making so much easier—thanks to her vast experience and clear guidance. She always knew where I needed to pivot and what to prioritize. That kind of mentorship is rare and extremely valuable.

2. Data Insights (DI) – High-Quality Content
e-GMAT’s DI module and question sets are excellent. The explanations are detailed, and the structure builds strong logical and analytical skills. Even on a bad test day, I was able to score an 84 in DI (97th percentile)—all thanks to their methods and practice questions. The content truly prepares you for anything the GMAT can throw at you.

3. Scholaranium – A Must-Have Tool
Scholaranium’s massive, high-quality question bank was one of the most useful tools in my prep. It made learning and practice much more effective. Without it, GMAT prep would’ve been extremely difficult. Plus, the performance analytics really help identify where you need to improve.Would make the product better:I had a good experience with e-GMAT so farI started my GMAT journey at 605 and then scored a 665. In my second attempt, I got 715, this improvement was made possible by e-GMAT’s structured course and supportive mentorship. My mentor believed more on me ,than I believe myself, She suggested to give a second attempt. The journey wasn’t always smooth—I had my share of ups and downs, but having a clear plan and regular guidance kept me moving forward.

The Last Mile Program (LMP) gave me a personalized study path and consistent progress check-ins from my mentor, which made it easier to make smart decisions. Scholaranium, with its vast question bank and performance analytics, was a game-changer for targeted practice.

Tips for aspirants:

1. Be consistent—daily effort matters more than long, irregular sessions.
2. Trust your mentor’s plan and avoid overthinking.
3. Deeply analyze your mistakes—that’s where growth happens.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. Adaptive preparation based on your strengths 
2. lets you plan your time and schedule better - Especially for working professional 
3. Structured approach for Verbal (ensures Conviction in marking answers) 
4. Good focus on details in DI and Quants
4. Cementing phase - E-GMAT's Cementing (intermediate tests at topic level) and Error Logs
5. Sectional Mock
6. Final Mock Papers - You get 5 mock papers.Would make the product better:Could increase the number of Mock test papers from existing 5 to 10 papers.I had purchased E-GMAT online 360. It had a time window of 4 months (you get option for 2 months or 6 months as well, based on your preference). There is also an option to extend your access in case you are not able to finish the course in the given time (with reasonable additional fees).  
This course is a complete self learning course, without any live instructor.  However, E-GMAT organises some of the live chat sessions with the instructors, to discuss some of the general matters around GMAT test prep.  

Some of the key plus points are as follows: 
1. Adaptive based on your strengths - Lets you skip the content in case you demonstrate 90%+ as starting capabilities in that topic. Saves lot of time along with maintaining the thorough approach.

2. Plan your time better - Good option where the work timings are not fixed. It gives you flexibility to manage your time. It also gave a proper study plan breaking down the topics and created day wise schedule for me to follow. 

After signing in, I gave a starting capabilities mock paper and scored 435. Then, I started for the prep. Few key strengths that i can list down based on my experience are:
 
1. Structured approach for Verbal (ensures Conviction in marking answers) - Read carefully + Full understanding + Pre-think before looking at answer choices + focus on details + Evaluate and visualise answer choices. E-GMAT's this approach formed a pillar on getting answers right with full conviction. 

2. Good focus on details - DI and Quant content makes you focus on small details / constraints. I started focussing on smaller hints / constraints / key words based on E-GMAT guidance. This helped me avoid lot of errors.

3. Cementing phase - These are intermediate tests at topic level. Re-call value for a learned topic increases significantly after doing cementing tests. There is enough pool of questions from which you get the questions in your cementing phase. So each time you give a cementing test, you encounter a different question, pushing you to use your brain in different ways. 

4. Sectional Mock - Section mocks helped out in providing good base to analyse the topics where additional efforts were required. You get more than 10 sectional mocks for each section. 

5. Building up Error Logs- E-GMAT gave detailed guidance on how to analyse the mistakes including evaluating correct but guessed answers. Building Error logs helped in last day revision of your mistakes and gives a closure before exam. 

6. Final Mock Papers - You get 5 mock papers. Although, this felt to be low since you would want to take mock papers during your preparation as well. I had to eventually buy Mock Papers from Official GMAT (gave 4 tests for Official GMAT as well). E-GMAT's Mocks test in real stimulation. Difficulty levels of the questions are more or less in line with final GMAT exam.

This overall helped me achieve a 695 in final GMAT Focus Test. V85, Q87 and DI82. Thanks.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","0","0","","","","","",""

The CR pre-thinking method and RC strategy helped me approach questions with clarity instead of guesswork. SC explanations were detailed and focused on meaning, which is crucial for GMAT Focus.

The Scholaranium platform deserves a special mention — the analytics helped me identify not just weak areas but patterns behind mistakes. I appreciated how the course builds gradually, layer by layer, without overwhelming you.

2. All progress in quantified and provided to you regularly, this way you can see how much you've been improving over time.

3. Lots of questions and practice mocks at a similar level of the actual GMAT exam for thorough preparation.

4. Self-paced content which provides accurate estimates of when you will be able to complete it all to plan in advanced properly.

5. Availability of an experienced mentors to provide direct and honest feedbackWould make the product better:1. Logging errors for reviewing them later can be made a bit simpler and categorical, to ensure users can find all their previous errors in one place and review them at once.I had been preparing for the GMAT for quite some time on my own, but didn't have a structured method or proper understanding of the concepts that are actually tested on the GMAT. After someone recommended e-GMAT, I gave it a go and was immediately impressed with what they have been able to put together. The courses for all 3 sections are very well structured and emphasize on strengthening core concepts instead of just solving questions mindlessly. This changed the way I was looking at verbal reasoning and enabled me to consistently score V80+. 

I was mentored by Rashmi in the Last Mile Push (LMP) program, which is a customized plan for the last 4-5 weeks before the official exam. It was a great experience getting feedback from an experienced mentor about how to overcome some of the last-minute challenges and maintain consistency; and finally how to make sure you do your absolute best on the official exam.

My Takeaway
1. Build trust in structured processes, own them and stick to them on test day.
2. Practice consistently and challenge yourself with hard problems.
5. Manage your time effectively and learn to move-on. Getting stuck somewhere and wasting time is never the right choice.
6. Always start new sections afresh, forget how the previous one went and put your entire focus into acing this one - one bad section will not affect your score if you're able to ace the rest","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:After analyzing Melissa's interview, I can craft a comprehensive review of e-GMAT's GMAT preparation program. Her journey from 625 to 685 highlights several standout features that made e-GMAT particularly effective compared to other preparation options she had tried.
e-GMAT's Data Insights preparation stands out as exceptional in the GMAT prep landscape. What sets it apart is the realistic exam simulation that allows students to navigate through multiple tabs just like on the actual exam - a feature Melissa noted was missing from other preparation sites. The variety of question types provided in e-GMAT's Data Insights section is impressive, covering everything from tables with paragraph information to diverse chart types that other preparation platforms simply don't offer. This comprehensive approach to DI preparation gives students exposure to the full spectrum of question formats they might encounter on test day, eliminating unwelcome surprises.Would make the product better:The platform's quantitative section delivers questions with a higher difficulty level than what's found in official GMAT exams, which proved to be excellent preparation for Melissa. When facing the actual GMAT, she found the questions more manageable because she had already practiced with more challenging material. The targeted practice system allows students to zero in on specific topics they struggle with, rather than repeatedly covering material they've already mastered. This personalized approach to practice is more efficient and effective than the one-size-fits-all method used by many other preparation programs.e-GMAT's mock exams provide a reliable indicator of performance and help identify areas for improvement. Though Melissa scored in the low 600s on most practice tests, the realistic testing environment and strategic guidance from her e-GMAT mentor helped her develop the mental resilience needed to push through difficult sections without giving up. The bookmarking strategy she learned proved invaluable, allowing her to flag challenging questions and return to them with a fresh perspective - a technique she successfully implemented on test day to maximize her score.
Perhaps most importantly, e-GMAT doesn't just focus on content knowledge, but also on developing the right test-taking mindset. Melissa emphasized that her mentality on exam day was the most critical factor in her success, and e-GMAT helped her cultivate that confidence. The preparation system taught her to look forward rather than dwelling on mistakes, to take strategic breaks between sections for mental reset, and to approach difficult questions with a clear time management strategy. These psychological aspects of test preparation are often overlooked by other programs but made the difference between Melissa's practice scores and her impressive 685 final result on her very first attempt.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","0","0","","","","","",""

After researching several options, I chose e-GMAT, and that decision made all the difference in my journey to a 735 score.
What sets e-GMAT apart is their data-driven approach to GMAT preparation. The PACE engine in the Quant section saved me over 50 hours of study time by accurately identifying which concepts I could skip and which needed attention. Their cementing quizzes helped solidify my understanding, improving both my accuracy and timing. Most impressively, their practice questions were often more challenging than the actual GMAT, which built my confidence and preparedness for test day.Would make the product better:The Verbal section was where e-GMAT truly shined. Their methodical approach to Critical Reasoning taught me the power of answer prediction (spending those crucial 15-20 seconds before looking at choices), transforming my approach to difficult questions. For Reading Comprehension, they taught strategic reading techniques that enhanced my focus and comprehension. By the end of my preparation, I was confidently eliminating incorrect options and consistently performing at a high level.Even with limited time to prepare for Data Insights, e-GMAT's application files and comprehensive practice helped me master this challenging section. Their strategic advice on section ordering was particularly valuable—switching to attempting DI first in my practice tests immediately improved my score from 625 to 715 in just one day! Overall, e-GMAT provided more than just content—they offered a strategic roadmap to GMAT success. Their methodical approach, high-quality practice materials, and data analytics tools helped me identify and address my weaknesses efficiently. For anyone serious about achieving a 700+ GMAT score, I cannot recommend e-GMAT highly enough. The investment in their program returned dividends in my 120-point score improvement and has opened doors to top business schools that once seemed out of reach.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6#","1","0","","","","","",""

In my opinion, eGMAT is overengineered in the best way possible—they provide absolutely everything a student could need to succeed.

As part of the LMP program, I had the opportunity to work 1-on-1 with my mentor, Rida, who provided invaluable insights, motivation, and a structured plan that pushed me to be better every day. Preparing for the GMAT is no easy journey, and having that level of support and encouragement is a true game changer.

I would wholeheartedly recommend the Last Mile Push program to anyone who is struggling to reach their target or simply needs that extra push and guidance to get there. The fact that it's included in the course fee makes it even more valuable. Trust the process, follow their guidance, and I truly believe you will see meaningful improvement.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=2#","0","0","","","","","",""

2. Exceptional Mentorship
3. Course Material and Teaching ApproachWould make the product better:NAAs a Data Analytics consultant with over three years of experience, I recently scored a 705 (Q84, V84, D87) on the GMAT Focus Edition. A friend recommended eGMAT, and over the past year, I went from a 555 (49th percentile) in their SigmaX Mock to my final score. Here’s what made eGMAT invaluable to my journey:
1. Structured Learning Approach
eGMAT follows a regimented, three-stage learning process across all sections (Quant, Verbal, and Data Insights).
•	Stage 1: Preparation – Concept Files (Video + Text material) explain key topics, followed by Guided Quizzes and Practice Quizzes to reinforce learning.
•	Stage 2: Cementing – GMAT-like quizzes ensure mastery at medium and hard difficulty levels before advancing.
•	Stage 3: Sectional Mocks – Full-length sectional tests help simulate exam conditions and refine weak areas.
The SigmaX Mocks are incredibly close to the actual GMAT in difficulty and scoring. Quant especially cannot be closer, making them excellent practice tools.
2. Exceptional Mentorship
The mentorship support was a game-changer. My mentor Dhruv Joshi:
•	Helped plan, track, and adjust my preparation at every stage.
•	Regularly checked in to ensure I stayed on track, even offering personalized advice when I got stuck.
•	Provided mental support, advising when to take breaks or modify my study approach.
This one-on-one guidance ensured that I was never lost in my prep.
3. Course Material & Teaching Approach
eGMAT prioritizes methodical problem-solving over speed, which naturally leads to faster execution over time. Couple of things that gave a significant improvement in performance for me were:
•	Quant: Focussing on extracting maximum information before solving, using simplifications and inferences for efficient problem-solving.
•	Verbal: Starting with Master Comprehension, which teaches how to read strategically.  Followed by Prethinking in CR / RC, emphasizing on complete understanding of the CR / RC passage over skimming through the content.
•	Data Insights: Builds upon Quant & Verbal skills while introducing several other techniques. For example, additional mathematical shortcuts to handle quant-heavy questions across all question-types efficiently. This saves you from using calculator for each and every math-related question.

eGMAT’s structured curriculum, realistic mocks, and unparalleled mentorship played a crucial role in my success. If you’re looking for a comprehensive GMAT prep solution, I highly recommend it!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=2#","0","0","","","","","",""

- Error log not useful at all if there is gap between your GMAT exam and last day of e-GMAT subscription as you can not see questions afterwards (logical from company end, but doesn't help students)

- Extended financial help for people with constraints (no budging from existing discounts)Was dicey about getting e-GMAT subscription as I had read both good and bad experiences on GMATClub as well as on Reddit but Chose to go on with my intuition.

Verbal:
The Course and questions bank was good. Pre-Thinking the conclusions/assumptions was a helpful technique in some scenarios once the efficiency improved.

In some of the questions, the pre-thinking (and answers) of many students were different from the person who created the questions, but that's how English is (depends on the person's mindset)

Quant:
Helped in conceptual building (was my strong area anyways). the PACE system helped in skipping topics which reduced the overall time to complete Quant as well. Some logics and techniques were taught directly via questions in scholarinium  (which can affect morale of some).

																			by score report","","Location","Strengths:e-GMAT's Pace Engine revolutionized my study approach by precisely identifying knowledge gaps and creating a personalized learning path. This intelligent system saved me approximately 25 hours by allowing me to skip familiar concepts while diving deeper into challenging areas. Rather than following a linear curriculum, the Pace Engine adapted to my strengths and weaknesses, particularly in Quant where I needed to focus on accuracy rather than formulas. The course structure moved systematically from fundamentals to advanced applications, ensuring I built a solid foundation before tackling more complex problems.Would make the product better:The Scholaranium question bank proved invaluable with its vast collection of practice questions stratified by difficulty level. This feature allowed me to progressively challenge myself from medium to hard questions across all topics. The platform's detailed analytics tracked my performance across all question types and difficulty levels, helping me identify patterns in my approach to different problem categories. Each question included comprehensive explanations and alternative solution approaches. The ability to create customized quizzes focusing on specific weaknesses helped me systematically address problem areas and steadily improve my accuracy rates.e-GMAT's Pre-thinking methodology completely transformed my approach to Verbal questions, especially Critical Reasoning. The course taught me to analyze arguments systematically before reviewing answer choices, preventing the common mistake of jumping directly to options. For Reading Comprehension, the structured approach to passage analysis helped improve my retention and question-answering efficiency. The course's logical progression from CR to RC skillsets created a natural learning path, with each concept building upon previous lessons. The cementing quizzes reinforced these methodologies through targeted practice until they became second nature.
The SIGMA-X Mocks and Section Tests were crucial for simulating test conditions and building mental stamina. Unlike official practice tests that recycle questions, SIGMA-X Mocks provided fresh challenges with each attempt, preventing false confidence. The detailed post-test analytics highlighted specific weaknesses across all sections. Following my instructor's recommendation, I completed daily section tests in the final two weeks, which dramatically improved my test temperament. The personalized coaching support provided strategic guidance throughout my journey, with mentors available to clarify concepts and suggest targeted practice areas based on my performance data.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=2#","0","0","","","","","",""

1. Great UI making learning experience very easy.
2. Lots of practice questions and timed tests
3. Mock exams that replicate actual GMAT exam
4. Targeted practice tests for weak areas.Would make the product better:None.I started my preparation with some old official guides and other books and soon realized it was extremely un-structured and not exhaustive in concepts and difficulty. I looked to subscribe to a GMAT preparation course and landed on e-gmat. My weaknesses were in verbal which I did very poorly on my mock test. In quants, my concepts were clear but I found myself succumbing to trap answers and silly mistakes. I started with building the fundamentals using the video courses on e-gmat followed by cementing quizzes on each concept. I first focused on accuracy and later improved timing. The support I got from the e-gmat team was incredible. They prepared a study plan specific to my strengths and weaknesses and also took into consideration my busy schedule. Abha was in constant touch and made sure I diagnose and fix my strategy when I faltered on tests. E-gmat’s recommendation to have a well defined error log helped especially towards the later stages of my preparation. Abha also helped me fill concept gaps that eventually helped me improve accuracy and timing. The next stage was being able to answer under time restrictions. For this, the e-gmat scholorium was the best tool. I was able to hone my test taking skills that significantly improved my ability to work within the time frame on the actual gmat exam. Followed by this, I tool 6 official mock exams scoring between 635-665. On the actual exam, I scored 665 (Q83, V84, DI82 – I also took the exam in this order). Two important tips for GMAT aspirants: A. try not to take too many mock exams right before the actual exam. B. try not to change the order of the sections on the final actual GMAT exam. C. Spend more time with the first 10 questions (I got only 3 wrong in quant and ended with a Q83, my mistakes were in the beginning-middle).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=2#","0","0","","","","","",""

2. Well-written solutions. Very important in verbal. I particularly liked that most of the questions had written explanations because I could quickly go through those and not have to go through a long video.
3. Prompt responses to queries to questions and their solutions.
4. The best thing about the product – its sectional mocks. Plenty of sectional mocks for constantly testing yourself, while building the muscle to solve the section in the stipulated time.Would make the product better:1. While learning the course, the option of marking certain sections complete when you deem it so. Otherwise, the plan doesn't adjust accordingly. Either way, doesn't make a tangible difference to the prep journey.
2. To have written explanations of whatever few questions don't have that.I had a good experience with e-gmat. Among the prep courses available, it is an affordable course and provides much of what is needed during the prep. I'll break up the review into sections, test practice, and the learning mentorship program.

Quant –
My quant was good to begin with, given my engineering background. However, I had a Q86 in my previous attempt. Certain improvements were required. I went through the entire course, tailored to my skill level. Helped me build confidence in sections I was slightly unsure of. The sectional mocks definitely help build muscle of tackling tough questions, which is something you don't get to practice in the OG full length mocks.

Verbal –
Major improvement here. From getting 5-6 wrong in RC to almost getting any wrong.  In my 715 attempt, got all RC right, and 2 wrong in CR. Also, built a lot of confidence in Boldface CR too.

DI –
The question banks are pretty good. Good classification among sections, like verbal and quant sections of TPA, so helps in improving certain parts of the section. I believe there is still room for requirement, but I believe that is true for all prep courses since this section is still relatively new.

Sectional and Full-Length Mocks –
The sectional mocks are godsent. They help in multiple ways. Once, you have completed the course structure, the idea is to test your sectional prowess, figure out weak areas, work on them, and repeat the process. The sectional mocks were pretty good for this. Also, helps build the muscle to complete the section in time, although DI in the actual paper has gotten pretty tough and vague, so I believe they'll adapt there eventually.

Last Mile Push Program –
Got personalised mentorship from Rashmi. She helped me identify my weak areas and pushed me to improve on them before appearing for the exam. Helped me with test strategies, and how to draw meaningful learnings from poor performances, which helped a fair bit on the exam day.


My final thoughts are that if you want a major improvement in any/all of the sections, a prep course may prove instrumental, because OG has niether enough questions nor the testing environment needed (OG mocks are still very helpful). The e-gmat program is reasonably priced, covers all bases, and has a good question bank.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=3#","0","0","","","","","",""

When I started with a 515 score, I needed a structured approach to GMAT preparation. e-GMAT provided me with a systematic learning path through their video lessons and practice modules.

Verbal Preparation

I found the verbal section particularly helpful. The pre-thinking methodology for Critical Reasoning took me time to master, but it became second nature after consistent practice. In Reading Comprehension, their Master Comprehension course taught me effective note-taking strategies that improved my passage understanding without wasting time.

What Could Be Better
The Multi-Source Reasoning section could have been more comprehensive.Would make the product better:Quantitative Section
In Quant, I found Scholaranium's questions matched well with actual GMAT difficulty. The PACE feature helped me save significant study time. I particularly appreciated their data analytics that helped me identify my weak areas. However, I did need to supplement my preparation with external resources for topics like inequalities and probability.
Data Insights Experience
Their Data Insights modules were helpful, especially for Data Sufficiency questions. The ""Traps and Tricks"" section helped me achieve 90% accuracy in DS. However, I struggled with Multi-Source Reasoning despite their materials and had to develop my own strategies.Platform Tools and Support
The analytics tools helped me track my progress effectively. I saw steady improvement in my mock scores, from 575 to 745 in practice tests. The structured approach helped me maintain consistency in my preparation.

Overall Impact

The platform played a significant role in my 160-point score improvement. While not perfect, it provided me with solid foundational content and effective practice tools. My success came from combining their structured approach with additional resources and consistent practice. I thank e-GMAT for the help and support throughout.

- Self-Paced
- Quick queries resolution
- CoachWould make the product better:Mock tests level can be improved to make closer to official MocksI think like anyone I would go with a product that is recommended by a friend or family or someone I know can trust on, that's why I joined a GMAT test prep course from another company in June, 2024. I prepared with them but could score only 635 in my first attempt in Oct, 2024. Its not that that company didn't prove to be helpful but it is when I joined e-gmat (being inspired by the results they advertised and student's interviews on youtube) and started my prep again, I saw how much e-gmat is advanced in terms of the quality of course they have structured on their platform.

I purchased a self-paced online course whose features were well suited was as since I didn't want to attend any live or classroom sessions. I knew that I had to fill my gaps in verbal (conceptual gap) not cor and data insights (conceptual gap + in-sufficient practice) - which as per one of the egmat senior team member - Sharddha mam's walkthrough of egmat platform was being covered in the plan I was going to enroll to.

Once I got onboarded, a coach was assigned to me (Rashmi mam) and she guided me in my prep journey. A few things imp for anyone who is starting their prep or is in the process and are looking for tips:

- Be consistent in your prep 
(Measure how much time you are spending each day in studying. It used to happen to me that I would feel I have spent about 4 hours a day which was my goal but actually one day when I used online browser clock to get the analysis, I was surprised to know that it was merely 2-.5 hrs. P.S: most my time in studying spent on online learning)

- Build error-log (I didn't like registering my mistakes, I was lazy and I felt I will remember it but all of that was oversight at my end. One fine day I realized this because I was making repetitive mistakes. That's when I thought to myself that let me prepare these error logs for only those areas that are weak for me - CR, MSR, TPA. Although RC was also a weak area for me but I don't think error log was that much required for it. And believe me, revising these error logs frequently helped me a lot. I used egmat's error log templates. Their CR error log template may look overwhelming but I customized it for me to see the question type, mistake made and action items)

- CR Prethink - 
(marketed by egmat but pay attention ""this is the way to go"" if you want to score really good in CR. And note this just a name given by egmat but is not something alien. Open GMAT OG, look at their CR solutions, they too teach exactly the same process. Initially you'll take some time in solving questions but if you keep on practice, you'll see the wonders happening. (P.S.: I've seen even Ron Purewell solve these questions in very similar style))

- RC improvement - follow egmat's way of reading the passage and the best arsenal to get to correct ans is eliminate options instead of going after the right answer. (While reading the passage - think of a third person or author reading that piece of info to you. This will help you understand where author's view is coming into play, what is crucial info and what are just details. Transition words are super imp)

- DI - Practice as much as you can. 
(In my first attemo I didn't practiced enough and that was a bug mistake. So, make sure you do and solve the question you got wrong, multiple times even if you feel you know the logic. Egmat helped with the DI section especially to me because it has plethora of questions and also the concepts file for verbal MSR, TPA did wonders for me)

- lastly but most important - believe in yourself and take blessings of GOD each day
(Surround yourself with people who motivates you, fill you with positivity and who care for you. I always had this belief that I'm capable but still on my bad days the doubt used to creep in me but talking to my family and friends, helped me immensely)

P.S. Pardon the flow of the above review and all sort of grammatical mistakes. I just wanted to spend some time to write a honest review of how I'm grateful for the egmat team and also through this inspire some of the students/candidates who are in their journey to prepare for GMAT. No matter what medium you choose to prepare, I wish you all the very best! I know you'll achieve your dreams sooner or later.

 I’m excited to share my GMAT journey, culminating in a score of 685 (Q88, V83, D81), achieved through focused effort over 4 months and strategic guidance from e-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returning to academics after nearly two decades, I identified GMAT as the gateway to my aspirations. Initially, I joined a classroom-based coaching institute to re-establish a study routine. While Quant was my strength, I struggled with Verbal and Data Insights.
My initial strategy relied on strong Quant scores to compensate for weaknesses in other sections. However, a bad day in Quant revealed the limitations of this approach, as my composite score plateaued at 655 with significant risk of going downward depending on Quant performance. I realized I needed to improve Verbal (from V81) and Data Insights (from D76) to achieve my target.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Turning Point: e-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2024, I joined e-GMAT’s LMP program, with Rashmi as my mentor. She customized a focused 4-week plan. This plan was a game-changer, leading to at least 30-point score improvement in composite score on the back of 2-3 point improvement in Verbal Scaled score and upto 5 point improvement in DI Scaled score!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Contributions of e-GMAT’s LMP Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Verbal Reasoning Mastery
The structured coursework emphasized clear processes, particularly in Critical Reasoning (CR), where I struggled.
The pre-thinking approach and “Cementing” phase stabilized my Verbal scores at V83, boosting both confidence and predictability through a very data driven process.

2. Data Insights Improvement
e-GMAT’s resources helped me manage time and tackle diverse question types like MSRs, graphs, and tables.
Translating statements into equations for Data Sufficiency and Two-Part Analysis became second nature.

3. Mindset and Strategy
Rashmi’s honest feedback helped me prioritize pacing, avoid getting stuck on tough questions and focus on improvement areas.
My perspective on MSRs transformed from avoidance to confident tackling, thanks to her guidance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips for GMAT Aspirants
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Build trust in structured processes, own them and stick to them on test day.
2. Practice consistently and challenge yourself with hard problems.
3. Focus on refining strategy and mental preparation in the final week.
4. Stay motivated, seek help when needed, and embrace course corrections. Remember in a long journey, there will be ups and downs.
5. Manage your time effectively and don’t dwell on questions that you are not able to tackle. Just move on.
6. Stay calm on test day, adapt to surprises, and treat each section afresh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Takeaway
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e-GMAT’s methodical approach, combined with Rashmi’s mentorship, was instrumental in my success. Their focus on data-driven improvement and strategic preparation gave me the confidence and skills to achieve my goal.
Good luck to all GMAT aspirants—stay focused and trust the process!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=5#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Preparing for GMAT can be frustrating but what makes it even more frustrating is the decision to select a course provider given numerous options in the market. E-GMAT stands out in this list of options for a variety of reasons. One of the best features I found on GMAT is the cementing mechanism which helps one drill the concepts learnt while applying them to actual questions for each topic which can be specifically beneficial if you already have foundations built and are looking to improve your score. Also the sectional tests and the actual mocks on e-gmat resonate with the actual test you will face on your exam date. Another important feature is that for each quiz or test you take you can customize it with difficulty levels of questions you want to attempt. This helps you build consistency by attempting a particular difficulty level which is crucial for securing a high score.

2. Scholaranium platform with a vast pool of high-quality questions comprising various difficulty levels.
3. 24x7 instructor and dedicated mentor support.Would make the product better:Some explanations are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory, which may confuse students. So, the explanations could be framed with better clarity.Hi, I’m Abhrajit Ghosh, and this is my second attempt at the GMAT Focus Edition, which I took on 9th January 2025 and achieved a score of 695 (98th %ile). I have been studying for the GMAT for four years now. On my first attempt, I got a 645 on my own just using the OG material and free resources available on GMAT Club. But now when I look back, I realize that a 50-point improvement would not have been possible without dedicated guidance and a proper strategy. That’s where e-GMAT came into the picture.
After getting a 645, I continued working on my weak areas for another 2 months, after which I decided to try out the first sigma-x mock by e-GMAT. Based on my performance, I got enrolled in their Last Mile Push program, which proved to be the game changer. I was assigned a dedicated mentor from the very first day. She charted a detailed, customized study plan that included weekly milestones, provided in-depth analysis of my Scholaranium mocks in one-on-one meetings, and suggested ways to overcome my weaknesses. And most importantly, she always encouraged me to stay optimistic and have self-belief in the crunch moments. Practice makes you perfect, but e-GMAT showed me that not just practice but perfect practice helps achieve perfection.

The 3 most pivotal areas where e-GMAT helped me are as follows:
1. The curriculum is strategically designed to introduce basic topics that would act as the building blocks for the more complex and advanced topics, thus making it easier to navigate through the entire course. I have always been good at quant, so I was able to utilize their PACE learning option, which helped me filter out just the content I needed improvement on. The verbal course helped me fill in my conceptual gaps, and the video explanations enabled me to better visualize and apply the POE approach when I was left with the two closest answer choices. The data insights course helped me read the DI questions better to get an accurate understanding of what has been mentioned and what exactly the question is asking. So, even though this section is highly time-consuming, I was able to implement the strategies and some intuition while solving the questions, which helped me keep track of time.
2. Scholaranium has a vast pool of questions to practice from, starting from topic-wise cementing quizzes to sectional mocks to full-length sigma-x mocks. It provided me with a thorough analysis of my performance across the sections (from accuracy to timing), which helped me instantly pinpoint the areas I need to work on to improve my accuracy as well as bring down the time taken per question.
3. During the end of the preparation, I was able to revise and reflect on my mistakes with the help of custom quizzes that contained previously attempted incorrect questions. As a result, I was completely prepared on the DOs and DONTS for the actual exam.

A few tips I would like to share with future GMAT aspirants. 
1. The Quant Section is generally harder in the actual exam than in the official mocks, so don't solely rely on the quality of questions you encounter in the official mocks. Practice harder questions so that you don't panic in the actual exam environment.
2. Practice the art of letting go. Don't beat yourself up; let the exam beat you. Learn to let go of the harder questions when you feel you have taken more than the time you should have taken to solve it. You can always come back and change the answer. That's one of the perks of GMAT Focus.
3. Time management is extremely important. Note down certain time intervals on your work pad so that you can check whether you are lagging or you're on pace with the allotted time.
4. Practice the mocks in different section orders to figure out the order that brings out your optimal performance. My 645 attempt was (V-Q-DI) whereas my 695 attempt was (Q-DI-V).
5. Official mocks 3 to 6 are harder than the first 2 free mocks. So they will provide you with a better indication of what your performance on the actual exam may look like. So use them very carefully.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=5#","0","0","","","","","",""

Scholaranium 2.0 Platform
Cementing Quizzes
Sectional Tests
SigmaX MocksWhen I started my GMAT prep, I was stuck at 595 and had no idea how to move forward. I kept hitting a wall and felt like I’d reached my limit. That’s when I decided to give e-GMAT a shot and it completely changed how I approached the test. Their structured course and tools helped me improve my score to 665. Here’s what really stood out for me:

1. A Verbal Course That Works
The Verbal section was my weakest area, and e-GMAT helped me turn it around.
a) For Critical Reasoning, the pre-thinking technique taught me how to break down arguments logically and anticipate answers before looking at the options. This made tough questions feel much more manageable.
b) For Reading Comprehension, their active reading strategies taught me how to focus on key points in a passage, even when the content was dense or boring.
These methods really stuck with me and helped me gain confidence in Verbal, which was a huge shift from where I started.

2. Scholaranium Platform
Scholaranium is hands down one of the best parts of e-GMAT. The quality of questions is top-notch, they feel very similar to the real GMAT. The platform also gives detailed analytics, so you can clearly see where you’re struggling and where you’re improving.

a) For Verbal, it helped me master things like Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension by drilling into specific problem areas.
b) For Quant, the question bank was challenging, but it pushed me to improve my speed and accuracy.

The feedback from Scholaranium really helped me focus my efforts instead of wasting time on random practice.

3. Cementing Quizzes
The Cementing Quizzes were like the glue that brought everything together for me. These quizzes helped me practice under GMAT-like conditions and build the stamina and confidence I needed for test day. They weren’t just about practice—they were about making sure I fully understood the concepts and could apply them consistently.

The 1-1 mentorship provided in the Last Mile Program is something which stands out with e-GMAT. My mentor Rashmi helped me create an extensive improvement plan focusing on my weak areas which boosted my score to the level I wished. Moreover, they are always available to help and guide you where you feel demotivated and low.

If you’re struggling with the GMAT, I can’t recommend e-GMAT enough. It’s not just a collection of video lessons and quizzes—it’s a well-thought-out system designed to actually help you get better. Whether it’s Verbal, Quant, or just getting over a plateau, they’ve got you covered.

For anyone feeling stuck like I was, e-GMAT could be the thing that makes the difference.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=5#","0","0","","","","","",""

Self Study phase : I utilized GMAT Club and GmatNinja which got me till 645. However, I had hit a plateau at 645 and needed to identify gaps and fine tune my weaker areas. 
After taking trial for most of the courses out there, I chose e-Gmat because of the detailed and diverse categorization of topics and practice material on their platform.

LMP : I was enrolled in the Last Mile Push Program, I worked closely with my mentor Abha, who helped me with identifying the areas requiring a back-to-basics approach and those needing more practice.
As a result, My accuracy improved significantly in Verbal and DI. In Quant, we fine-tuned my problem-solving process for specific topics that were taking longer than average to solve.

Overall, I found e-GMAT's content to be very carefully crafted, covering all aspects and question types you might encounter on the exam.

Here's what I liked about the course:

1. The meaning based approach in SC makes it so easy to find errors in sentences in a structured manner. This helped me develop SC into one of my strongest areas in the GMAT.

2. The RC reading strategies helped me a lot in terms of managing time during the exam, helping me form linkages and reduce my dependence on taking notes.

3. Scholaranium is a game changer. It provides unparalleled insights into where is it that we need to focus our efforts. It provides sub section level analysis of our performance, making the entire prep structured and data driven.

4. Mentorship: I wrote to the E-GMAT team requesting their help on charting out a plan to improve my score further from a 700 that I had scored in my first attempt. I'd like to thank Rashmi, my mentor, for the prompt and consistent support in charting out the plans, assessing my performance and tweaking the plans accordingly. Her inputs helped me improve my score from a 700 to a 720. I was unable to translate my performances in the mocks and practice quizzes on the exam day, else I'd have scored much higher. Rashmi was very prompt, patient and supportive throughout the prep phase and I'm grateful to her for going out of the way to help me.

All in all, I'd recommend the E-GMAT course not only because of their teaching methods, but also because the module (Course, Scholaranium, Sigma mocks) is very user friendly and provides unparalleled insights to help students take data driven insights, which help in directing efforts towards the weaker areas.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=6#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

What truly stands out about the platform is its incredibly structured and methodical approach to GMAT preparation. Their course is thoughtfully designed with a clear progression path, helping students build strong fundamentals before tackling more complex concepts.

The verbal section materials are particularly impressive, helping me achieve a dramatic improvement to the 94th percentile. Their pre-thinking approach for Critical Reasoning is a game-changer, helping develop a robust problem-solving framework. The Reading Comprehension module offers a systematic 7-8 step process that dramatically improves passage comprehension and question accuracy. The structured approach helps transform abstract concepts into actionable strategies.

The Scholaranium question bank is exceptional, offering questions that are often more challenging than the actual GMAT. This excellent preparation ensures students are well-equipped for test day. The platform's data analytics tools provide detailed performance insights, helping identify areas needing improvement and tracking progress effectively.
One of the most valuable features is their Last Mile Push program, which offers personalized mentorship and tailored study plans. Dhruv, one of the mentors, is highly experienced and provided strategic guidance throughout the preparation journey.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The verbal prep is unparalled.
P.A.C.E. is a handy feature to save time.
On-demand experts' assistance is as advertised.Would make the product better:I feel the quant section needs to be re-evaluated.
The estimated course durations are not accurate.
The study plan set for me was far from realistic.First and foremost, I would like to say that E-GMAT is by far the best platform I have used to learn and solidify concepts. This was especially helpful in the verbal section where I knew I struggled with the concepts and was in search of a guided framework which I developed through the duration of the course.
A little bit of background, I have, before this attempt, previously taken the GMAT classic, around a year before, in which I scored a 690 (classic). So when I took the free mock test on E-GMAT and got a 565, I knew a part of that was due to my rustiness with recalling the tricks of the trade and pacing. 
I was looking to push my score beyond the 700 (classic) mark and was looking for the right platform to help me with this. From my past experience, TTP was too cumbersome and the OG question bank was too surface-level. Having seen some reviews and talking in person to the E-GMAT team, I was sold on the merits of the course.
On signing up, I was helped with setting up a personalized study plan (PSP), and here lies the first area of consideration. Ideally, I would have set my target at a 655 (maybe 20 points higher at a 675 at most), but I was ushered to push for a 695, and that's how the PSP was set. I know this isn't a bad thing, but given the fact that I was only 2 months away from my exam, I felt this was more than I should have committed to.
To begin with, the verbal course is excellent. Hands-down the best for CR and RC you will find on the internet today. There are certain instances where the practice questions don't really match the GMAT style, but I feel E-GMAT is the closest of all the others. Now, during the exam, I did get a lot more assumption-type of questions which I think was less of a direct focus in the verbal modules, but the framework that is ingrained takes care of all question types—so 100% recommended for verbal prep.
Now, the prep is longer than it is listed and I kept falling behind on my study plan. By the time I reached the quant section, I was already panicking because I spent 50% of my prep time just on verbal. The real problem however is that the quant section was not at all like the actual GMAT. It is way more difficult than it should be, and maybe this is intentional, but for me, I was not able to get through the course. After doing a few modules, I stopped using E-GMAT altogether and instead signed up for GMATCLUB question bank and focus tests. Do understand this my personal experience. If I had more time, I would probably have been able to get through the quant course and maybe score even higher.
I spent the last 20 days of my prep just doing practice tests and quant questions from GMATCLUB. Sometimes I would do a verbal test on E-GMAT. I also didn't do any DI prep apart from practice tests. My practice tests ranged 635-655 and I was happy with that and my actual score being a 695 was just the cherry on top (tip: take 2-3 days off before the actual exam).
Overall, I highly recommend E-GMAT for your preparation, BUT keep these points in mind:
1. Allocate more time than the study plan's estimate (pace yourself by 1.5X).
2. Quant course will really test you, so be ready for that (actual GMAT was a breeze compared to the prep).
3.  Diversify your prep between a few sources as no one gets it a 100% right, but together (E-GMAT + GMATCLUB + OG) you are going to end up covering 99% of what will be there in the actual test.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=6#","0","0","","","","","",""

Additionally, their pre-thinking methodology for Critical Reasoning significantly improved my verbal performance, helping me achieve a V79 from V73.
The mentor support system is another strength. My mentor Dhruv provided consistent guidance through regular performance analysis, strategic advice, and quick responses to queries. What I particularly appreciated was the honest feedback about weaknesses - there was no sugar-coating, just actionable advice for improvement. The platform's analytics are impressive, offering detailed insights into performance across question types and an effective error logging system to track mistakes.
My sectional improvements speak for themselves - Quant from Q82 to Q87, Data Insights from DI73 to DI82 (93rd percentile), and Verbal from V73 to V79. These improvements came through structured learning, quality content, and strategic guidance. While the Coach Connect feature could be more structured, it's a minor concern in an otherwise excellent program.
What truly sets e-GMAT apart is how it helps develop both content knowledge and the right mindset for GMAT success. The platform's ability to identify and target specific weaknesses, rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, makes it particularly effective. For anyone serious about GMAT preparation, especially working professionals, e-GMAT offers a comprehensive, data-driven path to success.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=7#","0","0","","","","","",""

- Extensive question bank in the Scholaranium platform with a wide variety of difficulty levels.
- Customizable quizzes for targeted practice, allowing focus on specific weak areas and regular revision.
- Robust analytics that provide actionable insights into performance trends and weak areas.
- Dedicated mentorship through the Last Mile Push (LMP) program, offering personalized strategies and regular feedback.
- Prompt and reliable support from the e-GMAT team for any queries or concerns.Would make the product better:- Sigma-X Mock tests tend to feel more challenging and time-intensive than the actual GMAT, which can create a slight mismatch in expectations; aligning these mocks closer to the real exam would enhance their utility.
- Including shortcut methods alongside detailed solutions for Quant questions could help students solve problems faster during the actual exam.
- Some interface improvements could make navigation through the course modules more seamless.When I started preparing for the GMAT two months ago, I was completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content and the complexity of the test. As someone coming from a humanities background, the Quant section in particular felt like an insurmountable challenge. That’s when I decided to try e-GMAT, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made during my preparation journey.

Quant Section:
Numbers were never my strong suit, but e-GMAT’s methodical approach helped me overcome my fears. The course starts with foundational concepts, which are then reinforced through targeted practice questions and quizzes. The Scholaranium platform was particularly helpful, allowing me to focus on weaker topics like Geometry and Advanced Word Problems. Over time, I saw my accuracy in these areas climb from below 40% to over 80%, a transformation I never thought possible.

Verbal Section:
The Verbal section felt just as challenging initially, especially Sentence Correction. e-GMAT’s focus on breaking down grammar rules and teaching their application in a structured way made a huge difference. The pre-thinking strategy for Critical Reasoning was a revelation—it not only improved my speed but also helped me approach questions more confidently. Scholaranium’s detailed feedback and custom quizzes ensured I could drill down into specific problem types, like assumption-based questions, and improve systematically.

Data Insights Section:
The Data Insights section was entirely new to me, and I struggled to understand how to approach it effectively. The course broke it down into manageable subtopics and provided hard quizzes that helped me practice under exam-like conditions. Detailed performance analytics gave me insights into where I was falling short, and the mentors provided actionable advice on how to improve.

After three months of preparation, I scored 635 on my first attempt. While this was a solid start, I knew I could do better. 

Final Results:
In my second attempt, I achieved a 685- a score I once thought was out of reach. The entire e-GMAT team was there every step of the way, offering timely advice and unwavering support. Their structured approach and focus on fundamentals were key to my success.

e-GMAT isn’t just a GMAT course—it’s a complete ecosystem that equips you with the tools, strategies, and support needed to succeed. Whether you’re starting from scratch or aiming for a high score, e-GMAT has you covered. I can’t recommend it enough!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=7#","0","0","","","","","",""

Through the E-GMAT course, I was able to familiarize myself with all the topics tested in the GMAT examination in a personalized, self-paced, and convenient manner. Detailed concept files and comprehensive practice quizzes helped me get a top-to-bottom understanding of every concept. Moreover, the cementing quizzes (provided after completing all concept files concerning a topic), played a key role in repeatedly reinforcing the learned topic, especially when I would focus on other subject areas during my prep. The questions provided in the concept lessons as well as the ones tested in the quizzes and the mock tests are at a comparable (and sometimes above) the level of the actual GMAT exam, which also helped me understand the level of difficulty and the scoring system associated with the exam, helping me boost my confidence before the exam day. 

Finally, the personalized guidance provided by my mentor was a real game changer as I got a 360-degree view of my strengths and weaknesses, which I leveraged to strategize my prep, just a few days before the exam.

The GMAT exam is not an ordinary exam, it requires complete subject-matter understanding, undivided attention, shrewd strategizing as well as personalized guidance, and the E-GMAT Intensive course is one of the only courses that effectively provides all these features. Hence, it is an invaluable resource for anyone starting their prep to achieve their target GMAT score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=7#","0","0","","","","","",""

I would also appreciate the SIgma-x mock, along with the Scholaranium for accuracy practice drills.Would make the product better:I would appreciate it if they had a slightly more concise error-tracking mechanism, perhaps through text-based references v/s having to watch a video description of how to solve the question.I started preparing for the GMAT, hoping to get a 90%ile+ across sections through self-study. However, two months down the line I found myself in murky waters, with high self-doubts on my ability to predictably score, along with diminished confidence on my ability to come out of it. In such a time, I decided to enroll with e-GMAT.

After taking the initial mock and scoring a 665, and given constraints around time commitment, I knew that I had to take a curated path for all three sections. I was in touch with my mentor Rashmi, who was kind enough to proactively check in and offer course correction steps. 
For Verbal, I had to go through the entire curriculum, familiarizing myself with pre-thinking and getting accustomed to reading strategies, before moving towards cementing and the practice questions. I moved straight to the practice problems in Quant but soon had to take a step back at the cementing process to improve accuracy. 
I would definitely recommend e-GMAT for someone who’s looking for a reliable and accurate resource for studying, and for someone who wants to spend less time figuring out what to study, and focus only on execution.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=7#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT journey started 3 months back after I had already attempted actual GMAT with a 655 and a 49th percentile in Verbal section. I knew I wanted to increase my verbal score and that’s when I came across the Last Mile Push Program (LMP) of e-gmat. 

Things that stood out to me -  

1.Dedicated Mentorship: 

I was assigned a personal mentor, Rashmi, who helped me strategically plan milestones throughout my GMAT preparation to ensure I achieved the desired sub-section percentiles that would lead me to my target score. GMAT success is not just about mastering the subject but also about having a solid strategy and sticking to it. The team at e-GMAT is incredibly accessible, with doubts and questions being resolved within 24 hours.

2.Pre-thinking and Mastering Comprehension: 

These two strategies were pivotal in helping me improve my Verbal Reasoning score from the 49th to the 94th percentile. While there are mixed opinions about the pre-thinking method, I found it highly effective. Pre-thinking forces you to fully grasp the passage before analyzing it, which improves comprehension. Moreover, it aids in eliminating incorrect options, guiding you toward the correct answer. Mastering Comprehension not only boosts performance in Verbal but also assists in Data Interpretation (DI) and Quantitative sections, where complex question stems often obscure simple underlying concepts.

3.Extensive Question Bank: 
E-GMAT’s Scholaranium platform provides an ample selection of questions for both Quantitative and DI practice, particularly focusing on GI, TA, and MSR. Their structured approach encourages smarter problem-solving. By following e-GMAT’s methodologies, I felt far more confident tackling GI, TA, and MSR questions.

4.Balance with Official Material:
 I recommend that test-takers complement e-GMAT’s materials with official GMAT questions to better simulate the actual test environment. While some of e-GMAT’s questions can be more difficult than what you may encounter on the GMAT, it’s crucial to use judgment in managing time during preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=8#","0","0","","","","","",""

However, with e-GMAT’s structured study plan and timed curriculum, I was able to quickly and efficiently cover all the necessary topics. Their comprehensive approach eliminated the need for additional resources, saving me valuable time.

VERBAL Section - As a non-native English speaker with very limited reading habits, the GMAT Verbal section seemed like an insurmountable challenge. However, e-GMAT’s pre-thinking approach and extensive practice quizzes proved to be a lifeline. The course breaks down complex concepts into easily digestible steps, making the learning process as smooth as teaching a child. The numerous practice quizzes not only reinforced the concepts but also helped in building confidence and improving time management skills.

In my first attempt on October 4th, I secured a score of 645 (Q84, V81, D80). In order to improve my score in a short period, I got enrolled into the Last Mile Push (LMP) Program. This turned out be very helpful as I was assigned a dedicated mentor.
My mentor, Rida Shafeek, accurately identified my weak areas and provided tailored strategies to improve. Even though for a short period, she prepared detailed and target-oriented plan every alternate day, and helped me with analysis of my quiz results and suggested relevant improvement points. 
I'd like to also thank Abha and Dhruv, who provided the required support whenever required. They were always available to answer questions and address doubts. Their guidance and support were invaluable.

All of them kept regular checks on me and suggested right strategies which proved instrumental in my success during the Second attempt, in which I could score 715 (Q86, V84, D86).

DATA INSIGHTS Section - Since scoring 80+ was a rare thing for me in the 15-20 mocks I had taken earlier, I believed there's nothing much left for me to do for DI and 82 is the maximum score possible. It was only because of the push given by these mentors that I worked on each sub-section of DI intensively and practiced more and more Hard quizzes. This helped me score D86 in the actual exam.

e-GMAT's focus on simplicity and clarity makes the learning process accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.
I highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone aiming to achieve a high GMAT score. Their dedication to student success and approachability is truly commendable.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=8#","1","0","","","","","",""

But despite putting in consistent hours, my mock test scores were all over the place, ranging from 575 to 715. My first official attempt in July left me with a disappointing 625, and I genuinely questioned if I had it in me to crack this test. After a month-long break, I decided to give it another shot and signed up for the e-GMAT Last Mile Push (LMP) program in September, which proved to be a game-changer.

The structured approach offered by e-GMAT was exactly what I needed. From concept files to practice questions and cementing exercises, every step was designed to solidify my understanding of quant topics, and that progress naturally translated to data interpretation skills as well. I especially valued the focus on process skills—analyze, infer, conceptualize, and calculate. Being able to identify which step I faltered in when I got a question wrong allowed me to target my weaknesses and grow from my mistakes. Since GMAT quant revisits high school-level skills, having a solid refresher on these fundamentals was crucial for approaching more challenging problems.

Quant was always my weakest section. Coming from an engineering background, I was confident in my math abilities, but GMAT quant is a different beast. It wasn’t just about knowing the math but understanding how to perform under the pressure of time and accuracy. Through e-GMAT, I refined my strategy, ultimately improving from Q81 to Q88. The structured methods and focus on efficiency helped me build the confidence I needed to approach quant with a clear, timed strategy.

The Last Mile Push program was instrumental in helping me refine my approach for the final leg of prep. With the guidance of my coach, Rida, I learned how to target the last 20% of concepts and techniques that would drive the bulk of my score improvement. Rida's mentorship was invaluable; her insights and encouragement were a source of motivation that helped me focus on achieving a score I could be proud of.

In preparing for the GMAT, one of my biggest takeaways was the importance of rethinking my problem-solving approach. I realized I had been using thinking patterns that weren’t aligned with the demands of the test, and by learning to adapt my thought process, I could approach questions more effectively. This shift in mindset—paired with error logging, discipline, and a targeted strategy—ultimately showed me that, with the right tools and guidance, achieving a strong GMAT score is well within reach.

e-GMAT’s design, from concept building to test-taking strategy, is an exceptional resource for anyone willing to commit to the process.

After consulting with Dhruv, I planned a second attempt, prioritizing Verbal without sacrificing my strengths in Quant and DI.

The Scholaranium platform, with its challenging questions, greatly prepared me for the actual GMAT. Official mocks felt noticeably easier after practicing with e-GMAT's Scholaranium, and I consistently scored between 755 to 775. My accuracy at the end of my prep was at an all-time high, with 80% in Verbal, 75-80% in DI, and 95% in Quant.

e-GMAT’s targeted approach, high-quality content, and personalized guidance through Scholaranium and Dhruv’s insights transformed my prep journey. I highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone serious about achieving their potential on the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=8#","0","0","","","","","",""

One of the best things about e-GMAT is the personalized mentor support. Right from the start, I had access to a dedicated mentor(Rashmi) who helped me build a study plan and keep me on track. I didn’t feel like I was prepping alone at all. Whenever I hit a roadblock, whether it was with the new Data Insights section or tough Critical Reasoning questions, she was there to guide me with specific strategies and resources.
She reviewed my progress regularly and gave me feedback on where I needed to improve, which kept me super motivated. The one-on-one sessions were really helpful in refining my approach to the GMAT Focus Edition’s shorter format and understanding the nuances of the new sections.

->Verbal Section Mastery: 
e-GMAT is known for its verbal prep, and it totally lived up to the hype. They didn’t just throw a bunch of strategies at me but helped me apply them through personalized reviews and sessions. The ""pre-thinking"" approach to Critical Reasoning (CR) helped a lot thanks to the constant feedback I received.

They also gave me extra workshop videos and exercises in Reading Comprehension (RC) when I struggled with speed and comprehension, which helped me boost my accuracy for the Focus Edition’s condensed verbal section. Due to this, I was able to tackle even the trickiest questions with confidence.

->Solid Quant Prep:  
e-GMAT’s course really helped me break down complex problems into easy steps. They cover all the key concepts like algebra, number properties, and word problems. Their video explanations were clear and easy to follow, and I didn’t feel the need to use any other quant resources.
Their AI-driven Pace Engine helped me save a lot of time while completing the quant module as it gave precise suggestions about portions to be left based on my strengths.
Really loved that feature.


->Help with Data Insights: 
This was huge! The new Data Insights section combines data analysis, IR-type questions, and quant-heavy problems. It’s tricky, but e-GMAT added specific lessons and practice tests for this section. Their practice problems felt super close to what I faced on the real test. If you’re worried about Data Insights, their course will definitely help.
After getting a perfect DI score of DI90, I can safely say that their course is comprehensive and you would not need any other resource for your DI preparation.

->Scholaranium – The Best Part: 
Scholaranium, their quiz and analytics platform, is probably my favorite feature. It helps you track your strengths and weaknesses and lets you customize quizzes. I could literally see where I was lagging and fix those issues before they became a bigger problem. The detailed stats on accuracy and timing were incredibly helpful for the shorter Focus Edition format.Would make the product better:Personally, I really don't have any recommendations for improvement. I was completely satisfied with each and every aspect of the course. 
If I have to nitpick I would say their quant questions in mock were lengthier and tougher than those you would face in an actual GMAT exam. At times tough questions can lead to lower-than-expected scores in mock which can dent your confidence.The E-GMAT course is an excellent resource for GMAT preparation, offering a structured and systematic approach to learning. It begins by covering the fundamentals of each section, then progresses to the ""Cementing"" phase, which helps solidify and apply the knowledge gained. The platform provides a broad range of questions, making it a comprehensive prep tool.

E-GMAT’s quick response to forum queries is extremely helpful for online learners, allowing them to resolve doubts either by browsing previous answers or posting new questions if needed. The platform's strong digital framework, including tools like Scholaranium, Sigma-X mocks, and others, enhances the learning experience with thorough practice and AI-driven insights.

I owe much of my GMAT success to E-GMAT’s Last Mile Push (LMP) program. I joined LMP in April, and under the guidance of my mentor, Rashmi, I was able to cross my target score. Her tailored study plans, regular check-ins, prompt resolution of doubts, and continuous improvement strategies based on my cementing and mock test results were key to boosting my confidence and performance.

All in all, the e-GMAT was a fantastic choice for prepping for the GMAT Focus Edition. Their structured approach and new content for Data Insights were exactly what I needed. If you’re gearing up for the Focus Edition, I can't recommend e-GMAT enough!!!! Do check it out.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=10#","0","0","","","","","",""

Pre-thinking in Verbal: This method boosted my Verbal performance, especially in critical reasoning and sentence correction.

Scholaranium’s insights: Its data-driven approach identified my weak spots, allowing for focused practice.

Scholaranium - Question and Test Bank
LMP - Mentor AssistanceI had a 710 (89th - Q50 V35) on the Classic GMAT. I wanted an improvement in scores while applying to schools this year. I was considering multiple prep providers before zeroing in on e-GMAT. I think the pricing was better as well compared to the other courses I looked at. 

One thing that I was definitely looking for was a structured approach to learning across sections, and glad to say I was pretty satisfied with what e-GMAT offered.
It starts off with a mock test to analyze your strengths and weaknesses - the learning plan is made accordingly. I also took the LMP Option as I thought it would be more focused and dedicated, with a mentor to guide me better. 

Some context : At first, I was fairly confident on my Quant and DI, and thought I needed help only with verbal. But the mocks made me realize otherwise - after a couple of mocks, I found that my speed in DI was not good enough. And my plan was made accordingly as well. 

I’d attribute my entire verbal score increase (74th to 94th percentile) to this course. I was able to learn almost all CR concepts and techniques to tackle both CR and RC questions through the video lessons. The cementing quizzes were particularly helpful in my verbal prep. My mentor Rida, also helped identify and prioritize specific focus areas in verbal. 

I was parallelly able to work on my DI speeds as well through the cementing quizzes. The best part about cementing quizzes is that you can customize the difficulty and timing - helps in understanding where the problem lies. 

While I was hoping for a 725/735, I guess after a point you can’t really control what happens in the exam room.

- Course structure
- PACE platform which can adjust course completion timing based on pre-acquired skills
- Excellent mentor supportWould make the product better:- The Error log can be too overwhelming and may lose bit of value for some students
- The number of questions can be increased (the more the better)My name is Akhil Agrawal and I completed my first GMAT focus attempt on 20th September 2024 with a score of 685. I did my preparation through e-GMAT team. When I started my preparation, I had decent understanding of the Quant (because of my engineering back ground) but I lacked the ability to tackle verbal questions from their root. I did not have much familiarity with the Data Interpretation section. Additional hurdle for me was my rustiness in handling competitive exams after being not involved in one for 10 years. Quant being my strength helped me get a decent score in the test mock and I got enrolled into the Last Mile Push program of e-GMAT. This turned out be very helpful as I was assigned a dedicated mentor, who guided me throughout my GMAT journey. She prepared a detailed work plan, helped me with analysis of my quiz results and suggested relevant improvement points. Additionally, she kept regular checks on me and suggested right strategies which proved instrumental in my overall GMAT success.

The 3 most critical areas where e-GMAT team helped me are as follows:
-	Solidify my conceptual ability in Verbal: Earlier, I used to rush while reading RCs (to save time) and never understood the how to tackle the reasoning in CR questions. The e-GMAT verbal course is designed beautifully from basics and provides the right tools to handle these challenges. I got good clarity in tackling CR questions and utilized effective reading strategies. This also gave me a boost of morale in Verbal, which I always considered as my weakness.
-	Time managing and Exam sequence strategies – The median timings mentioned in solutions give a very nice reference point for start. However, each person needs to design his/her own strategy. One of my weaknesses was to get stuck on a question (especially in Quant) without letting it go. This was very detrimental for overall result. I will give a lot of credit to my e-GMAT mentor who pushed me hard to overcome this weakness. Additionally, she altered my exam sequence pattern which straight away gave me a boost of 20-30 points.
-	Practice Quizzes & Mock exams – Scholaranium has really good quality questions. If utilized properly, it can help in robust preparation for the exam. The course is designed to first learn the concept and then cement them properly so they remain lasting without very regular practice as well. Additional feature of scholaranium is generating custom full section as well as topic-based quizzes with very good analysis. Overall Scholaranium is a great platform to practice and get prepared for GMAT.

I also utilized the GMAT focus section tests as well as the huge question bank on GMAT club for my preparation. A few tips that I would like to give to GMAT aspirants is that time management is very critical – my observation has been that leaving even a question un-attempted has a very big penalty which brings down the score drastically. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised how change of sequence of sections can also create a good difference in final GMAT score. Changing my usual pattern from Q-V-DI to Q-DI-V proved to be very helpful. Additionally, the free official mock tests on mba.com are quite simple in compared to the actual exam. So, be careful in judging yourself just based on the 2 free mock tests.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=10#","2","0","","","","","",""

The way it is structured is wonderful. Instead of videos, there are interactive modules, which are very helpful in understanding the approach. I found the Pre-Thinking concept especially helpful. The expert faculty of e-GMAT conduct lectures, too. There are concept files that teach you the topic, followed by practice modules, and my favorite, the GMAT Skills module. The questions in these modules are very similar to those on the GMAT. Further, The Scholaranium contains all the types of questions required according to difficulty levels. I created custom quizzes, too, to practice different types of questions.
I am strong in Quant, and hence it was not a problem for me in terms of concepts, but I struggled with silly mistakes. I improved my performance, but I still was not able to get all correct. For the Data Insights section, I found that the questions were very similar to the actual exam, making you less prone to surprises. With all the solid preparation and support from e-GMAT sessions and modules, after around two months, I gave my GMAT and scored a 625 (Q82, V82, DI 79). I was not satisfied with the score, as I wanted to score at least 645, which is equivalent to 700 on the GMAT Classic, and would put me in the competitive score category.
So, I decided to appear for the GMAT again. This time, I was offered to join the LMP program of e-GMAT. Ms.Rida Shafeek was assigned as my mentor. She analyzed my score report and assured me that my target score was indeed possible. She even said that I could score much higher than 645 and set my target score at 695. She prepared my study plan, keeping my weaknesses in focus. As I progressed, I could see that my performance was getting better. I gave the official mock and scored 695. I was very happy with that performance. After completing the study plan, I gave the final mock and scored 715. This reassured me that I was ready for the test. 
Now comes the test day. I entered the testing room with a little nervousness, yet very confident. I chose the order as Quant-Verbal-Data Insights. I attempted the Quant section and was quite satisfied with my performance, and the same with Verbal. But then came the Data Insights section. Everything went fine up to the 12th question. There was an MSR set, and I could not understand it properly. I took so much time and still could not attempt the questions. I realized very late that I had wasted 15 minutes on that very set!
As soon as this realization set in, I tried to cover the remaining questions as fast as I could, but they were still taking time. I tried to go faster, but in the end, I had to just mark some questions and move on to avoid the penalty for missing questions. 
I scored 645 (Q84, V84, DI78) in that attempt. Even though it was much lower than my expectations, I took a sigh of relief. If I had not wasted that much time on that one question, I could have scored higher. But I decided to go ahead with this score as I wanted to apply in the first round and could not give it another try.
I would strongly recommend the e-GMAT course to anyone who wants to appear for the GMAT examination. Also, I strongly suggest letting go of any question that takes too much time—it costed me 20-30 points.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=10#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Context:
My first GMAT mock score was 505, and I knew that I would need a program, that would give me the necessary skill sets to reach the mountain top.
I knew my weakness is the VERBAL section, and was looking for a course that would help me gradually build up key skillsets and was affordable.
I shortlisted a couple of courses and tested a couple of them on their trial versions. Once I experienced e-gmat’s course I immediately knew it was the one. The course was structured, had a good reputation and was affordable. I even attended a couple of webinars held by Rajat and Payal and was immediately impressed.

For those who want quick tips / best practices for GMAT prep, I have listed my top 3 below:
Make sure to classify your errors in your error log and also any additional comments (such as Why did I falter or Why did I take so long or Correction Steps) should be as descriptive as possible.
Don’t worry if a strategy does not work for you, instead research for other strategies that best fit you.
Our brain works best in its most calm state, knowing how to get to that state is very important. For me, taking a deep breath for 5 seconds really helped me.
Be perfect in a section before moving to the next during preparation.
For those looking for details into my Preparation Strategy and D-Day Experience I have provided them below:

Preparation Strategy:
I prepared for GMAT in the following sections order one by one: VERBAL / QUANT / DI
I followed e-gmat’s detailed study plan, completed the cementing quizzes and also worked on the OG Questions before moving on to the next section.
A couple of tips from e-GMAT which really resonated with me were:

For Verbal:
Pre-thinking possible answers for RC Questions.
Mastering Reading Comprehension, by pausing at various points, to try to assimilate what that sentence meant and what is its relation with the content mentioned previously.
For Quant:
Making inferences of statements mentioned in the question stem.
For DI:
Understanding / Owning the dataset by taking small examples and making 1-2 observations
Calculating various values such as means, variance etc. from graphs quickly.

Post my preparation, I worked on my accuracy in e-gmat's scholaranium, trying to reach the 90% accuracy in medium questions and hard questions as well. Every mistake I made was logged in the Error log (provided by e-gmat) in a descriptive manner to truly understand what my mistake was.

I gave 10 Full length Mocks with different combinations of sectional orders, to see how my progress was and take the required steps to make any correction to my process, or mannerisms when writing the test. I noticed I was consistently doing well in QUANT, however, there were many peaks and valleys in my VERBAL and DI scores.

I realized I was taking too long to answer Verbal Questions especially CR which gave me very little time to complete questions in the end with good accuracy. For verbal, I created a document on the types of traps GMAT commonly used and was actively looking for these traps in the options. Similarly for DI, I realized I was taking too much time in answering MSR questions. To manage my time, I referred to the ""Timing Strategies page"" on the GMAT Club forum, and followed the processes mentioned in it. These changes in my strategy made very large improvements in my score.

My final 2 mocks I managed to score 655 and I found that my best results came when I attempted in QUANT-DI-VERBAL order. I felt the reason for this was QUANT was my best section, and it gave me the necessary boost to attempt the remaining sections with confidence. I kept VERBAL for last just after the 10 minute break, so as to avoid mental fatigue and bad decision making.

D-Day Experience:

On the day of my exam, I attempted a few easy questions, before giving the actual exam so as to get my confidence high and hit the ground with an active state of mind.

During the exam, I felt confident and calm. As I expected, QUANT went well for me, and I managed to get only 3 wrong answers. However, DI section hit me like a train, I felt that I was getting lost in thoughts and started taking longer than normal, after 5 questions I knew if I kept going in this manner my performance would not be good. So, I took 5 seconds, to recuperate my focus by taking a deep breath and got back into the game.
With this a switch turned on and I started answering questions more quickly and faster. Finally, I managed to get 15/20 questions right.

I took my 10-minute break and prepared myself for the VERBAL section mentally and physically. When I got back, I quickly created a grid to help me not look back at options I had rejected on solid grounds. After every 5 questions I would quickly review how my progress was and make sure necessary corrections were made in the next 5 questions. I knew I was lacking time to complete 4 questions in 5 minutes, so I randomly put 4 answers to, and I made sure to answer 3 out of 4 of these questions properly, by changing their answer post submission. Finally, I got 17/23 questions right.

I was elated when I saw my provisional score and I knew that it was time to celebrate. I want to thank everyone from the e-gmat team for their immense support and prompt attention to all my queries.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=10#","0","0","","","","","",""

This seems to discourage the students.When I first considered preparing for the GMAT, I was concerned about the significant time and effort it would require, especially while working. However, a friend recommended the E-GMAT course and gave me confidence that it was achievable.
After enrolling in their basic course on June 2024, I gave a mock test to gauge my current level, scoring 555. Since then, I didn’t need to use any other materials or question banks for preparation. The amount of material and questions provided was more than enough. After 2.5 months, I was able to complete all the concept modules (Stage 1) and achieve the threshold scores in their cementing quizzes (Stage 2). This gave me the confidence to move on to the test readiness quizzes (Stage 3).
In the Test Readiness stage, my scores began to decline, and I struggled to identify my weak areas. I reached out to the E-GMAT support team for assistance, and Dhruv guided me throughout the process, helping me strengthen my weak areas. He also helped me in choosing an Exam Date as per my performance. Then came the final stage: Mock tests. Initially, I scored well (665 and 695), but some personal matters distracted me, and I lost my momentum with the subsequent attempts. As the exam date approached, I found more time for practice and got back on track. My final mock attempt scored 695, which really boosted my confidence.
I would like to sincerely thank the E-GMAT team for providing such an excellent platform to learn with utmost ease.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=11#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. The amount of detail in the course. This course alone is sufficient to cover all concepts needed to ace the exam
2. The number of problems available for practice
3. Similarity of questions to the real GMATThe aspect of the course I really love is the amount of detail present in the course. If you can be patient ( Which you really need for GMAT ) and take the time to understand the processes and practices put in place this course is an absolute banger! It hits all the required aspects in Verbal, Quant and DI. The questions on the Scholaranium might feel they are slightly harder than the ones in the GMAT official book but trust me, once you get the hang of the principles mentioned in the course they will really help you a lot when actually  applying the concepts on the GMAT and it will feel like a breeze. The number of questions you can practice on to apply the concepts you learn is insane. So if you take the time and mindfully practice, I can guarantee that it will improve your score a lot!

The platform is also simple to use and pretty straightforward. They walk you through the learning stages - like Cementing and Test Readiness so you are 100% sure that you know the concept, learnt the concept and can apply the concept. They walk you through prethinking for CR, reading strategies in Verbal, applying process skills in Quant and owning the dataset in DI, all of which I really found helpful in my GMAT exam. 

I was part of the LMP program ( Last Mile Push Program ) where you are paired with a mentor who can motivate you, guide you on where you should be focusing your time and skills on and even help you in areas you are weak. This really pushed me when I was feeling down or couldn't gather enough motivation to finish my tasks. 

Overall Tips if you plan on choosing the course:
1. Be Patient and follow through the course. This isn't a small course by any means. It is meant to take you to 99 percentile. And contrary to the saying ""Good things don't come in small packages""

2. Keep yourself motivated throughout the course. They have a system where if you get the questions right in the pre test of a concept, you are advised on what concepts you can skip. Take it up as a challenge and try to do your best and gamify your experience so it's interesting

3. If there is anyone you can rely on to push you to get that score, ( sometimes we all need that extra push ) don't be shy to reach out and ask the e-GMAT team for help. They will try and help you as much as they can. 

4. The course is slightly expensive. So don't fall off the track. Keep the momentum going and try and complete the course within 4 months if possible.

All the best!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=11#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. Well structured.
2. Excellent data analytics to save time and know strengths and weaknesses.
3. Empathetic free mentorship.Would make the product better:The DI course modules can get better and more aligned with actual OG questions.I started my GMAT preparation in January 2024. On a friend's advice, I registered myself for the egamt's Online 360 course. Before starting the course, I attempted a full length egmat mock and scored 425. Time management was the biggest concern for me. I realized I wasn't ready for this exam and needed a structured approach for my preparations.  

I started doing all the module courses to get hold of the concepts in quant and verbal. I was doing decently well in the module tests and kept moving ahead in the course. In one of the module tests when my score was low, I decided to write a mail to egmat support to have a look, review my preparations and provide some feedback. Honestly speaking I didn't have many expectations from an online portal providing any sort of mentorship but decided to seek help just for the sake of it.  

To my surprise, the reply that I received was very assuring and motivating. Hereon, egmat mentor Ms Rashmi Vaidya became a dedicated virtual mentor for me for the following months of my preparations. I moved places and relocated 3 times between January and April. This combined with the unpredictable nature of workload at a startup I would have weeks when I couldn't study even for an hour. But Rashmi and sometimes other mentors who would write to me would still be very patient and supportive.  

By April 15 I had finally settled at one location and decided to study regularly aiming to take the exam around the end of June. During this time Rashmi gave me a reality check. Knowing concepts well just by covering the module courses was only 1/3rd of the preparations done for GMAT. She introduced me to the egmat idea of ‘cementing’ and ‘test readiness’ stages post finishing the online modules. The true importance of this I realized post my first attempt.  

I completed all three stages for quant, did it partially for verbal and could not finish even the module courses for DI by end of June. I had fixed the exam date as 11th July. So, by end June I started giving official mocks and following were my scores 

Mock 1 – 645 Q-84, V-80, DI-81. 

Mock 2 – 595 Q-84, V-79, DI-76. 

Mock 3 – 675 Q-86, V-83, DI-81 

egmat mock - 595 

I was having serious issues with time management in both verbal and DI. Invariably having to guess 5-6 questions in the end for both these sections in each mock. This was a result of not doing cementing and test readiness for those two sections.  

The final exam was no different, I had time management issues in both verbal and DI. Guessed last 4 answers in verbal and 6/7 answers in DI. 

Final exam score: 655 Q-87, V-80, DI-80. 

I know the score isn’t exceptional, but it isn’t bad either. I can’t thank Rashmi enough for guiding me through this journey and being so patient with the erratic nature of my possible study schedules.
I must say if you take this online course and actually diligently complete all three stages of preparation on egmat portal, with the required score metrics, no force can stop you from getting an exceptionally high score at GMAT focus edition.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=11#","0","0","","","","","",""

I scored a 555, and understood that I need to strengthen my basics, especially in Verbal and Data Insights sections. I chose eGMAT based on a plethora of positive reviews by GMAT achievers, and I'm happy that my choice was apt.

The first and foremost thing I loved about eGMAT was a clear and personalized study plan, having which I fel confident about the preparation at the beginning. 

I started with Verbal section, where the course has worked wonders for me. The clarity it gave on the concepts tested, and the well laid out methodologies for solving CR and RC questions were really helpful. Overall, it laid an excellent foundation on which I built my verbal ability.

Quant has always been a strong area for me, as I have scored  100% in Quantitative Aptitude even in my GATE-2019 examination. However, the depth of concept covered in eGMAT quant is unmatched in all sub sections. 

Data Insights is one area where I struggled the most initially. But the simplified manner in which core concepts of graphical analysis, table analysis and multi source reasoning are presented in the course have made my life easier.

Cementing, as the name suggests, is a crucial building block of GMAT ability, and it played a pivotal role in my journey too. 

Last but not the least, the Last Mile Push program, where we are assigned a dedicated strategy expert cum mentor is absolutely game changing. Akash and Abha, my mentors, supported me in every step of the way and helped me set accurate goals. Abha's analysis of my mock exams has helped me strategize the real exam in an efficient way.

Overall, eGMAT stands out in many ways and I recommend the course to serious aspirants looking for significant score boost.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=12#","0","0","","","","","",""

3. Creating test center like environment with help of their cementing section.Would make the product better:e-GMAT is perfect from every angle. I will just have one small advice for them, make the website a little more optimized for phones or tabs, as the videos sometimes refused to load. Also a mobile application for e-GMAT would be an icing on the cake.The biggest strength of e-GMAT is its verbal and DI section. They have few excellent strategies to ace the verbal section. For DI, they have a invaluable collections of DI questions covering each and every types. The collections of problems for Quant, Verbal and DI are huge and those questions actually resembles the GMAT FOCUS question types. When I first started the course, I still remember the score I got in my 1st official mock. It was 575. To regain my confidence back and choose the e-GMAT was probably my best decision ever.

E-gmat's personalised mentorship was a gamechanger for me as I was given much important direction to build a solid strategy and identify areas of improvement comprehensively. My mock scores in official mocks ranged from 665 to 715, with most of the scores between 695-705. On the test day, I followed the sectional order of Q,DI,break, VR. I wasnt able to solve the first question on the QA and ended up spending 6 minutes initially on it. However, the rest of the questions were fairly easy, hence I was left with 12 minutes spare post completion of the section to return to the first question and edit it to the correct answer. The DI and VR section was fairly smooth.

Short tests after each module to check your understanding
Interactive Learning 
PACE automated skill gauging to allow you to skip skills you already possess 
Enough Resources
Ease of access to coach
Test Readiness short quizzes to improve your agility
Sigma X MocksWould make the product better:I feel the DI section is relatively new and hence for many MSR questions I found the performance metrics to be flawed: as in, a too hard question is marked as easy and also the median time taken to answer those looks flawed. This is only for the MSR part.
For verbal, initially I used to feel that your questions are hard but having taken official mock tests and the exam I now feel that it isn't hard enough because I faced some pretty scary questions in the main test.
I think a VERY HARD rating for certain quant questions help us not worry a lot when we miss a relatively hard question. So egmat must mark few of the hardest  questions as such.In the age of Artificial Intelligence it feels really nice to be catered by Human Intelligence. Egmat does exactly that. In my previous attempts I had tried things my own way with a subscription of a particularly famous organization.  But it lacked the interactive aspect that is a usp for egamt.
All concepts are explained in videos. Their algorithm is carefully designed to gauge your skills and adapt with that.
The PACE feature allows you to skip skills which you are already confident in. But it feels like the olden days as if a coach is there to guide you. I have, on occasions  not liked some explanations and replied to them and they have promptly replied and a proper argument led to a rectification of the issue. 
Too many organizations have claimed to not use any 'gimmicks' or quick tricks to ace the exam. I can attest personally that egmat, (sometimes a bit annoyingly) always avoids quick fixes. This forces you to adopt the conceptual clarity and as they like to call it 'own the dataset!' 
Following the basic principles of learning and no quick tricks the curriculum induced in me a regular habit of the pre-thinking and falsification techniques. I was able to handle complicated CR questions i.e. rejecting the right options for the right reasons and narrowing down the best option. 
One ability that always felt impossible for me was completing the first RC question within 3.5 minutes. But egmat's resources allowed me to handle the same with ease.
They have a strongly crafted set of resources for the DI section which I felt was an apt reflection of the official test.
It goes without saying that the quant section is as good as expected. 
If their methodical approach of learning, cementing and test readiness is adopted there is no reason why one can't ace the gmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=12#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:- Great availability of resources
- Great mentor support
- Effective methodology (especially filling knowledge gaps at first and then practicing)Would make the product better:- More time-efficient options (esp. for people without much time to prepare)
- More clarity on how to follow the Study Plan
- More tips on Quant on alternative ways to face problems (e.g. choice elimination)Methodology
- Simply put, the methodology consists of learning content for each sub-module (e.g. CR), practicing this content to reinforce learnings (called “Cementing”), and then practicing all parts of each module together (e.g. Verbal)
-In my opinion, this works quite well, especially in cases like mine where I had no idea what was tested on the GMAT. With this, I could fill all “knowledge gaps” I had on each topic and reinforce the new learnings before moving on to the next one
-As a con, this approach followed to the letter may not be the most time-efficient, so those with less time available probably would need to adapt it. Also, I would’ve liked more focus on tips for facing the test (e.g., solve some Quant questions by choice analysis or other shortcuts, practice on timing and skipping, etc.)
-For Verbal questions, learning was based on ""Pre-thinking"", which is basically doing specific reasoning (depending on the type of question) before reading and selecting choices. In my experience, these strategies were valuable in the first stage of learning, although in my particular case I had to adapt them quite a bit for the real exam: as in my case I have some difficulties with English, I needed more time to read and understand the texts, and if I developed the complete pre-thinking then I spent too much time per question; as I could not improve this much, I developed a ""simplified"" pre-thinking in which my focus was on understanding the logical thread of the arguments. Basically, I would recommend doing these pre-thinkings at the beginning to reinforce learning, but then practicing to find the optimal distribution of time between reading the text, pre-thinking and reading/analysis of alternatives
-The platform also teaches some reading strategies that can be helpful in Verbal, especially in RC. In my case, it was difficult to apply them all and always, but I think that having some in mind helps improve reading speed and comprehension (practice them is key)

Resources
- In my opinion, the strongest point of e-GMAT. You can find both the material to learn and a good set of questions to practice, as well as 5 mocks (I took 4/5, and I consider that they were of pretty good quality). In addition, together with the e-GMAT subscription you are entitled to a few months of GMAT Club quizzes, which I found to be an excellent complement
- As a con, I think sometimes questions are more “complex” than in the real exam (e.g., in Quant, some Hard questions are too long, while in the real exam I found hard questions to be “trickier” rather than longer). For this reason, in my case it was useful to complement the study with the GMAT Focus Edition Official Guide (you can find OG questions in GMAT Club too). 

Support
- With your e-GMAT subscription you are assigned a mentor, and in my case, my mentor was of great help for my improvement since she helped me define concrete actions based on my results. I would recommend being proactive in seeking help from your mentor, given that I found the base resources (like the study plan) quite generic
- I would also like to mention that I was part of The Last Mile Program, which consists of having a more personalized plan and greater follow-up by your mentor. I consider both points to have been very important towards the end of my study since, as I mentioned before, my mentor was developing specific action plans based on how I was doing, and the continuous follow-up also forced me to be more consistent in my study

2) From all the different mocks I have given, I felt the one which E-Gmat provides gives the best estimate of the score you might get at the actual exam.
3) The course structure is well made with many questions so that one remembers what he/she has learned.
4) The mentoring service which the LMP program provides gives structure to your preparation so that you know exactly where to focus.Would make the product better:I liked the product overall so I don't have any pointers on where to improve as such, once you go through it you will understand 😁Hi, My name is Abin Selby and I recently scored a score of 675 on the focus edition (Q84,V84,DI82) with the help of E-Gmat LMP program. Do I would like to post my experience  here so as to help other students who are in similar position as me.

I had started this course on 9th March 2024 and through the LMP program I was assigned my mentor Rashmi Ma'am without whom I wouldn't have been able to get the score I got. Now like most Indians my quant was strong (though didn't get what I expected in the test :/) my verbal was weak, and to add to that, with my busy schedule at work I was away from studies for a long time. So after my first mock with E-Gmat (I scored 615) I connected with Rashmi Ma'am wherein she guided me through my report and highlighted places to improve on. She then made me a personalized plan to follow so as to increase my score. Now for 2 months in between I wasn't able to study due to work and even with that she believed that I could get a good score with a month in hand. That's what propelled me to focus even more on Gmat and here we are with a score of 675😁 (96th Percentile) a 60 POINT IMPROVEMENT. 
Now that might not seem like a lot for some people but I am happy with it and this wouldn't have been possible for me without E-Gmat. 
I hope this helps atleast a few people 😁😁

My GMAT journey started in May'2023 when I gave my first attempt. I had not signed up for any course and took the exam after 1-2 months of self study from Official guide and GMAT club. I received a score of 650 (much lower than my target score of 700+). After interaction with alumni from my target schools (IIM A,B, C and ISB) and considering my strong academics, I applied to my target schools with this score. Fortunately, I received calls from IIM B, C and ISB but couldn't convert any of them. Hence, I planned to re-write the exam. Since all my peers had improved their scores through e-gmat course, they advised me to join the course. I did not want to take any chances this time and so, I joined e-gmat's focused study course in Mar'24.
Before beginning the course, I was required to take a diagnostic mock test in which I scored a 595 (V79, DI74, Q86). The journey from these scores to my final 665 was challenging, but e-GMAT's comprehensive approach made it possible. e-GMAT's PSP (Personalised study Plan) feature helped provide a clear picture of the time required to achieve my target score. I could also input my tentative study hours for each day in advance, which ensured that the plan was thorough.
Coming to the course, the course is so intricately designed and structured that it ensures interactive and immersive learning. Each course is followed by an assessment quiz, which are followed by application and practice files containing more practice questions. After completion of a course, cementing quizzes are to be passed without which the course is not considered complete.
E-GMAT's pre-thinking approach for Critical reasoning  is a game changer and makes solving CR questions a cake walk. 
The Quant course is also excellent. Being from engineering background, I had good quant skills already but lacked the process skills required to solve 21 questions within a time span of 45 minutes, that too with a high accuracy. The skills taught in the course along a large pool of practice questions helped me improve my Quant accuracy from 80% to 95%. 
After completing the Verbal and Quant courses, The Data Interpretation questions seemed pretty easy to understand and solve. Furthermore, the course approach of teaching through case study application and practice files really helped. My DI score improved from 74 to 81. 
Last but not the least, The Last Mile Push (LMP) program played a key role in my success. The thorough study plan devised in the program helped improve my accuracy on Hard questions. 
E-GMAT team's continual support, strategic guidance, mock analysis and feedback throughout the program is commendable.
I highly recommend e-GMAT course to everyone aspiring to achieve a decent GMAT score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=12#","0","0","","","","","",""

I started with a diagnostic mock score of 575 (V79, DI70, Q87). My initial DI ability was at a mere 70. The journey from these scores to my final 695 was challenging, but e-GMAT's comprehensive approach made it possible.
From the very beginning, their Personalized Study Plan (PSP) gave me a clear roadmap of how to proceed from my initial scores and which areas to focus on. This structured approach really helped me, as studying all subjects simultaneously wasn't working for me before.
One of the standout features was the pre-thinking strategy for Critical Reasoning. Initially, I struggled with this, but after going back to the application files and practice files, I was able to internalize the process. This not only improved my accuracy but also saved time during the exam.
For Reading Comprehension, the emphasis on taking precise notes was game-changing. The coach connect sessions, especially with Shraddha and Rajat, exposed my weaknesses and helped me improve significantly in areas like author's POV and inference questions.
In Quant, despite having a strong foundation, the process skills taught in e-GMAT courses were invaluable. They helped me approach GMAT-style questions more effectively, especially in areas like word problems where I initially struggled.
The Data Interpretation section, which was new to me, became much more manageable after completing the Verbal and Quant sections. e-GMAT's approach to teaching DI as an application of concepts from Verbal and Quant made it less abstract and more approachable. I saw a significant improvement from my initial DI ability of 70 to my final score of 82.
The Scholarinium question bank was incredibly helpful. Many questions I encountered in the actual GMAT were similar to those I had practiced, which boosted my confidence during the test.
Lastly, the Last Mile Push program was instrumental in my final preparation. It provided a structured approach to achieving my target score, focusing on hard questions and building confidence through sectional tests and full-length mocks.

Before my prep I gave the official mock and got a 595. The egmat course helped me improve my score by 70 points. 

Things I liked about egmat:
1. Course Content: The course is very structured and covers everything you'll need for the gmat. There were small concept quizzes after each video lesson which was very helpful in applying the learned concepts.
Master comprehension module in the verbal section was especially helpful. 
In quant, there were diagnostic quizzes before lessons which allowed me to skip topics that I was already comfortable with as suggested by the algorithm. This helped me save time.

2. The scholaranium provides ample number of good quality questions throughout all the sections. And it also provides a detailed review after every quiz which helped me find my weak areas and work on them. 

3. Last Mile Push Support: This was especially helpful for me. I would like to thank Abha and all other egmat mentors for their guidance and support. The personalized study plan made by Abha was very helpful in covering the course and getting close to my target score. Also, the mental and emotional support she provided towards the end of the prep was very helpful.

4. Cementing quizzes after every subsection: Cementing quizzes are a carefully curated mix of around 10 questions from a subsection to gauge our level of preparedness after each subsection. Practicing cementing quizzes increased my accuracy and time taken per question in verbal to under 2 mins. 

5. The Mocks were helpful in building stamina for the whole test and also helped in identifying the weak areas from the analysis given by the algorithm.

All in all I would recommend the egmat course to anyone who is okay with self learning through video lessons. 
Since my target score was 695-705, I will be retaking the exam once again.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=13#","0","0","","","","","",""

The pre-thinking and visualization techniques for Critical Reasoning taught me to break down arguments systematically, anticipate correct answers, and spot flaws with precision. It also helped me learn active reading, identifying key information quickly, and tackle even the most complex passages with confidence.When I started my GMAT journey, I was scoring 635 and struggling to improve. After a disappointing second attempt of 655, I knew I needed a different approach. That's when I discovered e-GMAT, and it completely transformed my GMAT preparation.
e-GMAT was a game-changer in my GMAT journey. Their structured approach to Verbal was unlike anything I'd experienced before. The pre-thinking and visualization techniques for Critical Reasoning were eye-opening. They taught me to break down arguments systematically, anticipate correct answers, and spot flaws with precision. This approach turned CR from a weakness into a strength.
For Reading Comprehension, e-GMAT's strategies were equally transformative. They taught me how to read actively, identify key information quickly, and tackle even the most complex passages with confidence. My comprehension improved dramatically, and I found myself answering questions more accurately and in less time.
What really sets e-GMAT apart is their Scholaranium platform. The quality and variety of questions were outstanding, closely mirroring what I encountered on the official GMAT. This was especially true for Data Insights. The DI questions on Scholaranium were challenging and representative, helping me develop the perfect balance between speed and accuracy. This practice was instrumental in achieving my 98th percentile DI score.
The Quant Scholaranium also deserves a special mention. The rigorous practice I got here was invaluable. Even though the questions were often tougher than the actual GMAT, it helped me build my resilience and problem-solving skills. It prepared me to handle any curve balls the real test might throw.
Perhaps the most crucial element of my success was e-GMAT's Last Mile Program. My dedicated mentor didn't just assign practice tests; they created a personalized study plan tailored to my strengths and weaknesses. This roadmap guided my final weeks of preparation, ensuring I focused on the areas that would yield the greatest improvements. The personalized attention and strategic guidance were truly the secret weapons in my GMAT arsenal.
Thanks to e-GMAT's comprehensive approach, I improved from a 635 to a 715, landing in the top 1% of test-takers globally. The course not only enhanced my skills but also boosted my confidence, allowing me to walk into the test center feeling fully prepared.
For anyone serious about GMAT success, especially those struggling to break through a score plateau, I can't recommend e-GMAT enough. It's more than just a prep course; it's a complete GMAT success system that delivers results.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=14#","0","0","","","","","",""

Sigma X mocksI attempted my first GMAT exam in August 2023 and scored 680. There was no structure to my preparation. I realised that with the proper guide and structured preparation, I would be able to score higher. Without wasting much time, I immediately contacted the e-gmat team to help me get to my desired score. 

My starting score was 680, so the e-gmat team enrolled me into their LMP program. My mentor, Rashmi Vaidhya, analysed my ESR and shared a personalised improvement plan. Verbal was my weaker section so I was suggested to go through the entire verbal section of the e-gmat. The verbal section of the e-gmat is very comprehensive and their “Master Comprehension” part helped me build a strong foundation for the verbal. 

After the course completion, I attempted the e-gmat’s Sigma X mocks and scored in the range of 650-690. I must say that the e-gmat’s Sigma X mocks algorithm and questions are very similar to the Official GMAT exam. I again attempted the GMAT on January 2024 as the last day of GMAT Current Edition was 31st January. I scored 690 on this attempt, which was evident from my Sigma X mocks. 

In verbal, SC was my weaker area so I decided to go with GFE. The DI section of e-gmat is very comprehensive and covers all possible questions for GITA, TPA and MSR. There are so many good-quality GITA, TPA, and MSR questions in the e-gmat scholaranium that you can practice. 

I was doing well in course quizzes but was not able to replicate the same in a final exam. Rashmi accurately identified the gap i.e. my anxiety while attempting the exam. She suggested that I have done every possible thing that I could do in terms of studying, now I have to focus only on improving my behavioural issues. Every time when I connect with her, she boosts my confidence and guides me on improving my behavioural issues. She also shares insights from her experience with the journey of other students and motivates me. 

E-gmat has recently launched its CoachConnect program to efficiently cement each stage of the GMAT preparation. I could attend only one RC session of CoachConnect conducted by Payal. It helped effectively distinguish between the author’s point and third-party point in RC. RC passage covered in the session was very diverse and the questions that we solved were also testing the different skill sets. 

Last month I attempted GMAT and scored 645. Though I could not score that well, I improved on my behavioural issues. I panicked in the quant section but was able to get out of it and attempt the next sections Verbal and DI with a positive perspective. 

Though the journey is not over yet, the battle is half-won. I truly believe that with this great e-game platform and fabulous mentorship guidance and support, I will be able to achieve my target score.

I highly regard the e-GMAT’s support system and Mentorship (LMP program).

I recommend the e-GMAT course as it will help build a strong foundation and assist you at every juncture of your preparation journey to keep you on track to achieve your target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=15#","0","0","","","","","",""

Also, their pre-topic diagnostic quizzes also help you skip a lot of content if you are already adept at a certain topic.

While the course content for all three sections is well formulated and helps you improve, I specifically recommend the Data Insight section.

I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a self-paced course which can keep them motivated and consistent in their journey. There could be many sources for practice questions and preparation but what makes e-GMAT unique for me is the way it helps you define goals and a path to reach them. It can be hard sometimes to stay motivated while managing a full-time career and resume studies for long intervals after a couple of years. Some topics may seem easier to grasp based on personal interest but others might feel very challenging, in such a scenario one might likely feel discouraged or disappointed. e-GMAT content has a core value associated with it which is - that as long as you follow the process, you’ll be able to solve the question - This is something that got drilled into me and helped me believe that no matter the setback I can push myself and achieve my target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=15#","0","0","","","","","",""

2. Structured content with exercises at the end of each module which help in applying the concepts being learned in the module.
3. Scholaranium has a lot of questions to learn from and apply the learnings and developing the skills required for the Gmat.
4. Mentorship & strategy based approach based on your current learnings and skills.Would make the product better:1. For DS more verbal questions category should be added.
2. For creating a cementing quiz of 23 questions for verbal we should have the flexibility of choosing 3- 4 questions per passage so that the exact number of questions are 23 and are not increased while attempting the quiz.It has been a long journey from 615 to 695 where E-Gmat has played a crucial role. Also thanks to Abha she has helped a lot in this roller coaster journey.
After attempting my 1st scholaranium mock I realised that my weak areas were verbal and DI as I was barely able to finish the sections. Being a working professional I could not do this on my own because of work commitments so decided to join a course based on my friends previous experience with the E-Gmat course and my research I decided to join E-Gmat.
The Structure of the course helped me learn and apply the concepts after each module this application based approach increased my learning outcomes tremendously and at the same time i was able to do more focused prep. 
In Verbal CR Pre-thinking is game changer trust me it works wonders once you start applying the process and this skill is leveraged in RC and DI as well. After going through the modules the time for answering the verbal questions decreased and was able to complete the sections without much time pressure.
DI section caters to most of the diverse questions asked on the Gmat with some of them quite challenging to prepare for more difficult questions. The process based approach in DI helps a lot in reducing the time and increasing the overall accuracy.
Quant being my strength area the course recommended a P.A.C.E based approach so i was spending more time on sectionals rather than learning the concepts again.
I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to score high. Trust the process their are a lot of Distractions related to courses but I would recommend anyone who is reading this that trust the instructors and the process. Gmat is not about solving to many questions but learning from each and every question.
Being part of the LMP program helped me in the last phase of my Gmat journey where even after fluctuations in my test score through Abha's mentorship and strategic reviewing I was able to finalize and implement my strategy for the D-day.
Mocks are a crucial aspect of testing the skills of an aspirant and the Sigma-X-Mock comes close to the actual test as I only attempted Sigma-X-Mock and 2 Mba.com mocks so the mocks provided are enough to prepare for the exam also their is a great feature that after a mock for the sections we don't perform well their are additional questions added to the scholaranium based on the latest attempt.
One of the best parts is the availability and flexibility of contacting the mentor over the Email helps a lot in resolving any doubts.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=15#","0","0","","","","","",""

The variety of questions provided a solid foundation to alleviate test anxiety and improve my score.Would make the product better:Like most other prep websites and resources, mock tests difficulty is above the offical mocks and exam.Hi everyone,

I recently took the GMAT FE Exam and scored a 695! I wanted to share my prep journey with eGMAT as a working professional.

The Journey:
I purchased eGMAT's 4-month access in January as I planned to take my exam in April. I took a fresh mock to benchmark myself and scored a 585 before starting my prep. While I intended to start in January, due to workload and personal issues, I couldn't get much done in January and February.

In March, I made a study plan using eGMAT's automated Planner with scores from my mocks as inputs to chart a complete pathway for my prep. This is where the course really helped me, especially in my weakest (now strongest) areas like CR, Quant - Algebra, and DI - MSR. Thanks to its streamlined structure, I was able to complete my prep by the end of March. Cementing Quizzes, Concept videos, and Expert support were essential for my preparation. After completing my preparation of each section and topic, I took my first official mock and scored 675 – a 90-point improvement from just the prep itself. In the last two weeks, I focused mainly on solving a ton of questions from OG and eGMAT's scholarium. I took three additional mocks with scores ranging from 645 to 685.

As I was in my final few days before the Exam, I was still scoring very randomly in CR from 30th to 80th, and I didn't seem to break through this roadblock. This is where revisiting concept videos helped to reimagine and correct my approach for CR, which ultimately helped me to get a 100th in CR on the official Exam! For Quant, I was pretty decent from the start, so it helped me to cut short my prep time to four weeks, but I always got a couple of questions incorrect on mocks and practice tests. So I took some more cementing quizzes in relaxed mode to understand that my main flaw was around missing a couple of details/traps. I came up with a QC approach for each question to double-check every answer on Quant, ultimately helping me to score a Q90! For DI, I believe eGMAT Scholarium is an excellent reflection of the real GMAT questions, and I just relied on them for my overall prep.

Tips for Test Takers:
1. Practice makes perfect: Especially in Quant. There are only certain kinds of questions GMAT throws at you, so prepare them well.
2. Quality Checks are important to avoid traps: Quant and DI are full of traps, so it's important that you read the question correctly and just have a quick 10-15 second check for the answer.
3. Bookmarking: Helpful in Quant/Verbal. Please avoid in DI. Only bookmark a maximum of three questions per section.
4. Navigating test anxiety: The real exam might seem harder to some folks (including me), but it's important to understand that if it seems hard to you, then you're probably scoring well! Don't overthink it! Treat it like any other mock and manage to take breaks well to re-energize during the exam.

Reflecting on my journey, I'm grateful for the support of eGMAT's resources and mentors for helping me get one step closer to a top B-School. I hope my experience and tips serve as a helpful guide for others preparing for the GMAT FE Exam. Best of luck to all!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","1","0","","","","","",""

Quant: The kind of questions on scholaranium is good, you have the option to create quizzes based on your requirement like may be mixed quiz or for a specific topic. The analytics help you to identify how you fare among all the others. It help you to identify your weak areas as well.

2. Verbal : Again, I feel the scholaranium is the best part, the questions and amount of practice you can there to solidify your understanding is really great. Helped me improve from v79to v83. 

3. Data Insight : The questions are similar to actual test, but again the main thing is the amount of question and quality of question you have to practice is great.

They provide a comprehensive and adaptive study plan that tells you exactly what you need to study, how long, and keeps track of your progress. They have a gigantic library of practice problems and they keep track of what you got wrong. Also, they have wonderful mock tests and custom quizzes available so that you can see areas of weaknesses and improve drastically on them!Would make the product better:The only tricky part is that there is a lot to this platform. Take time and go through the orientation videos that they provide, otherwise you will be lost. There are so many great features, but it is overwhelming if you don’t take time to get acquainted. One feature that I wish I learned about quicker was utilizing the Q&A in every question. There is a form where you can submit questions about particular problems and see other people’s questions. A few times, I went here and found that someone else had the same exact question that was already answered by an expert. If it isn’t already answered, E-GMAT does a wonderful job of answering it as soon as possible.E-GMAT is the most comprehensive and efficient tool for you to improve on the GMAT! I am a college student running two businesses, and I improved my score over 100 points in a month using E-GMAT. They don't just give you problems and answers. They teach you how to efficiently and effectively solve problems. I struggled most on time and how to break down problems when I started. One of the best things about E-GMAT is they teach you how to “Pre-think,” which is a strategy used in Verbal and Data Insights to save a ton of time and get the right answer before evaluating the answers. Also, E-GMAT has lesson plans that teach you the information needed to solve the problems and the techniques to apply the information to solve complex problems. They have a huge library of practice problems that you can work through. Each question has a comprehensive solution explanation along with strategies on how to solve it. Just as your study journey changes, the platform is also very adaptive. E-GMAT keeps a record of all of your practice and improvement. This allowed me to see which types of questions I struggled with the most. Lastly, I was able to assemble practice quizzes made up of problems that I got wrong or took a lot of time on. Using these, I was able to become faster at complex quantitative problems and data sufficiency problems. I highly recommend E-GMAT to the people who do not want tricks, but who actually want a tool bag to solve complex problems and score in the top percentiles.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I recently graduated with a degree in Industrial Engineering. Before starting my professional career, I decided to tackle the GMAT to clear it off my checklist. Despite my strong background in these fields, I found the Quantitative section to be my Achilles' heel. One of the major challenges I faced during my GMAT preparation was finding dedicated study time and sticking to a consistent plan. With numerous distractions and other activities vying for my attention, maintaining a focused study routine was often difficult.

For my GMAT preparation, I opted for e-GMAT as my primary study resource. The platform proved to be comprehensive, offering everything I needed to prepare for the exam in one place. It allowed me to identify and work on my weaknesses effectively, especially in the Quant section. The personalized study approach was invaluable, enabling me to skip sections where I was already performing well and focus more on challenging topics. Additionally, the detailed solution videos provided by e-GMAT were instrumental in enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding complex concepts.

In the final weeks leading up to the exam, I intensified my study efforts with an intense focus on revisiting challenging topics and taking practice tests to simulate the actual exam environment. While e-GMAT's resources were comprehensive, I felt that more specific guidance or test-taking tips for the final push would have been beneficial. For future GMAT aspirants, I highly recommend starting the preparation early, even if you're planning to apply 3-4 years from now. This approach will allow you to study at a comfortable pace without feeling pressured. Consistency is key, so maintain regular study habits, focus on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing them, and practice regularly to identify and improve your weaknesses.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","2","0","","","June 04, 2024","Sayyaf_Ibrahim","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-1440683.html","Hello @Mpmunoz

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Scientifically designed course content 
Focus on structured approach to questions 
Strong mentor support 
Personalised strategy & learning supportWould make the product better:NoneI have taken up e-gmat self paced course on 12 Aug 2023. I gave my first attempt on Jan 25th 2024 and scored 655. My second attempt was on Mar 21st 2024 and finally achieved my target score of 695. 

How I came across e-gmat 
I have enquired with a few of my friends and colleagues regarding the best course available in the market. E-gmat was a clear winner with 100% of them voting for it.  Without any second thoughts, I went ahead with the same. 

My Experience during initial preparation
I would call this as the phase of understanding the requirements of the test and learning the core concepts required to attain proficiency. Their modules in Quant, DI and Verbal were very crisp and to the point. I felt their content and modules are very scientifically designed to exactly meet the test requirements without taking too much of the candidate’s time. 
I really commend their PACE module in Quant section which precisely identifies your starting ability and suggests modules which can be safely skipped thus resulting in significant time savings.  Another distinguishing feature of e-gmat is their emphasis on structured approach for all quant problems. They strongly discourage teaching any shortcuts in solving the questions. Developing this ability equips you with all the skills needed to solve higher difficulty questions with ease. 
Verbal was a challenge for me. Their entire verbal course emphasizes on the most essential skill of comprehension, visualization of argument/passage. Again, they do not recommend any shortcuts. “Master comprehension” module is the backbone for entire verbal course. Pre-thinking approach of e-gmat is a game changer in CR and RC as well. Though I initially felt it to be very time consuming, I slowly realized the ease with which CR questions can be solved once you master this approach. 
I started Data Insights section with a lot of speculation after going through other’s experiences. I was very low on confidence initially but by the end of the course I realized that the skill set required to ace DI is a combination of comprehension/visualization techniques mastered in Verbal section plus employing the structured approach mastered in Quant section. At the end of the day I have secured 82 with 94 percentile in DI. 

Scholaranium 
I would call it a treasure trove. This gives the necessary practice to put the candidate into the test environment, both in terms of difficulty and timed practice, right after learning the concepts. The quality of questions is too good and at the level of final test. Attempting these questions gives a realistic estimate of one’s level of preparation. After each test, the platforms presents the time/performance metrics which are helpful in self-evaluation. This is what they call “strategic review” and plays an important role in identifying and filling the gaps in preparation. 

Mentor support/Interaction with team 
Before taking up the course, I have heard that e-gmat provides support only through emails/their forum and does not facilitate direct verbal interaction with subject matter experts [SME] and that this is their main drawback. 
In my experience, I find that the solutions provided by SME’s on the doubts raised on their forum are very elaborate and leave no room for any further confusion. Things become crystal clear after going through their explanation. 
They have a dedicated strategy team who evaluate your account and are happy to suggest plans for improvement. Team has always responded within a day over email for any questions regarding strategy. They address any kind of queries during your preparation. I was not aware of this kind of support until I attended one of their free webinars where this aspect has come up accidentally.  It was through these discussions that I interacted with Rida, who was my mentor till the end of my GMAT journey. She was very supportive and readily supported in devising a study plan/ providing extra resources to improve my verbal performance/ detailed analysis of mocks. She was kind enough to offer me scholarship for their prestigious Last Mile Program [LMP]

LMP
I was a part of LMP just before my first attempt but for only 2 weeks. I could not benefit totally from this program as I do not have enough time left before my first attempt. I was not very happy with my score in first attempt. I have communicated the same to the team. Payal has taken over at this point and provided a structured and objective plan with clear targets to put me on the path to my target score of 685 [eventually hit a 695]. She has analysed all my scholaranium attempts/ my first GMAT attempt and provided me with a clear insight into what was going wrong. This was a game-changer for me. I started identifying my faults and rectified one by one. 
Her emphasis on visualization, comprehension, translation, and inference have created wonders for me and I landed at a 695 in my second attempt. Though these skills sound very simple and familiar, I have neglected them and did not realise their importance. I always felt I need to master something very complex to move to higher scores. While working on this plan, I realized that GMAT is a simple test that is intelligently designed with many traps. It is these traps that make the test appear as difficult. Her words that “It is not enough if you can see what could be the answer, it is also important to see what are the kind of wrong answers that can be provided” has changed my perspective of looking at every question. Apart from the correct answer, I started seeing the wrong answers and understand the kind of traps that are set in the test. 

Free Resources 
I have attended their free webinars hosted by Rajat and Payal every week on a wide variety of topics. Though they are offered for free these sessions are content rich and have helped me a lot. There is one particular session of Rajat on Mastering RC where he demonstrated the skill of reading an RC passage like a manager. This has helped me a lot in improving my RC abilities. 

Overall, I would say that e-gmat offers the best resources for GMAT preparation alongside having a very competent and a friendly team for support. All the mentors are so supportive and accommodative of any special requirements. If you are ready to give your 100% to your preparation, they leave no stone unturned in ensuring your success. It is this additional human touch that differentiates a good course from a great course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","6","0","","","","","",""

I sensed the need of a planned training with guidance to doubts. I opted for E-GMAT post analysis and it is an understatement to say that I am happy with the results. I started with preparing for Quant and Verbal for GMAT Classic. Quant has been my strength so there was no concern with it. Verbal was a nightmare for me and that was one reason why I have taken E-GMAT as it is known to help non-native speakers. For GMAT Focus, I had the added advantage that Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension were relatively my stronger sections in Verbal. But E-GMAT actually helped me bolster my preparation for these sections. Their Master Comprehension section trains you for these two sections and even for MSR in DI section. Finding the 4 incorrect options out of the 5 options is an effective strategy but E-GMAT's stress on Pre-Thinking is to help you reach to the right answer at faster pace.
Another place E-GMAT helped me particularly is the Bold Face questions in Critical Reasoning, I used to let go of Bold Face questions due to the time they used to consume. E-GMAT's strategy has been effective enough for me to get almost every Bold Face questions right after a point.
Finally, with all the information flowing around, DI has been a nightmare for me. In my first mock, I got a 77 in DI and I realised there is a long road up ahead. However, E-GMAT has ton of questions to practice and shares a couple of questions as templates that are extremely useful. With the right amount of practice, one can predict where is the question leading to after going through the templates and save those previous seconds.
Finally, I was able to achieve 685 and I am extremely happy with the result! Thanks to E-GMAT and especially their counsellor who has kept track of my practice and activities throughout the process.
Preparing alone is great but in case of doubt, it is good to get a training kit such as the ones provided by E-GMAT because it nearly narrows down your actions and makes this whole process much efficient!

5. Supportive communityI first stumbled upon e-GMAT through a friend's recommendation, and I'm incredibly grateful for it. This platform has been instrumental in my GMAT preparation journey, particularly in tackling all three subsections effectively. What sets e-GMAT apart is their strategic approach tailored to each subsection. Their emphasis on understanding the meaning behind questions and prethinking techniques significantly boosted my verbal score.

One crucial lesson I learned is that mastering a topic isn't about solving endless questions but grasping problem-solving methodologies and solidifying basic concepts. The cementing quizzes provided a test-like environment, reinforcing all the concepts I learned in each subsection.

The PACE engine on the platform was a game-changer, saving me countless hours by allowing me to skip concepts I already knew well, focusing instead on areas where I needed improvement. Additionally, the e-GMAT forum proved invaluable. Engaging with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the forum, especially regarding Reading Comprehension (RC) and Critical Reasoning (CR), was enlightening. Harsha, one of my favorite SMEs, always offered spot-on responses that addressed the gaps in my understanding.

Akash from the strategy team deserves a special mention as well. He's been a constant source of support throughout my journey, providing guidance on areas of improvement, strengths, and exam strategy. Our discussions have been pivotal in shaping my preparation.

For any MBA aspirant, I wholeheartedly recommend e-GMAT. Their comprehensive approach, personalized guidance, and supportive community make it an indispensable tool for GMAT success.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","0","0","","","April 03, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear sidsuvarna,

																			by score report","Points","Location","Initially I thought about preparing for the GMAT on my own. However, I found it difficult to design a plan given the many resources available. I opted for e-Gmat's course so I would have something structured and comprehensive.

At first, you create your own Personalized Study Plan, which is interesting because it gives an idea of how much time to spend on each section. However, if you decide to complete every lesson and every quiz available, like I did, the PSP will significantly underestimate the time needed. It took me about three months to go through the whole course, though for the first month I dedicated only 2-3 hours/day (later 6+ hours/day).

I didn't try any other course, but I would recommend e-GMAT. To be honest, I chose the service because it had good reviews, but mostly because of its attractive pricing. I'm happy with the value I got for the money invested.

The program is comprehensive and the lessons are short and to the point. Lessons are usually followed by quizzes, which are very helpful because, at the end of the day, GMAT's content is fairly easy, what you need is a lot of practice solving questions. 

The team is also very responsive. Communication is done through email, but I'd usually get a response within a few hours.

On the negative side, at times I was annoyed by questions that had the wrong answer marked. I remember a couple of instances, with questions regarding Correlation, that some students had previously expressed concerns on the forum, and the tutors reiterated that the answers was correct (it wasn't). I suggested they ran the correlation on Excel, which clearly showed that the answer was wrong. 

The problem with that is that after you spot a few errors, you start questioning every explanation that you don't immediately agree with. I ended up wasting a lot of time checking questions I got wrong and trying to figure out is the explanation made sense.

Additionally, I was disappointed with the mock exams offered. In every exam I scored way below my target score. When I switched to the official mocks, I scored way above my target in every occasion. This is mostly the reason why I'm giving the service 4 stars. Getting such low scores deeply affected my self-confidence and I even thought about giving up. As it turns out, e-GMAT's mocks had mostly questions that took way longer than two minutes to solve. For example, in one of the mocks I scored 615, while on the official mocks I was scoring 685-725 (my actual score was 685 unfortunately).

In summary, I believe the service is good and would recommend it. Just keep in mind that the official mocks are a much better reflection of your potential score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=16#","0","0","","","March 23, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear felipebravo,  

Congratulations on your score of 685 with a remarkable V86, Q85, and DI81. With this, you have become a part of the top 3 percentile test takers! A 90-point improvement overall with a 98th percentile score in Verbal is a phenomenal feat to achieve in just 3 months.  

To begin with, let us look at the image below which shows how beautifully you implemented your Personalized Study Plan (PSP) by understanding the learning architecture and the overall required effort -  

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/felipebravo-Personalized-Study-Plan

Please note, that the job of PSP is to give you an estimate based on your starting and target abilities. Like the GMAT, this estimate has a standard error – of about 15% or about 12-15 days in your case. I believe you were within that range.  

Let us talk about mocks: Your criticism here is absolutely accurate – our mock scoring was harsh in the range you described. Our algorithm team took action on the same based on your feedback. We have tracked our scores since then, and they have been tracking very closely with both the official mocks and the actual attempts.   

Once again, I want to thank you for being a student and for your constant feedback. We have created more than 2500 learning items and 12 new products for the GFE. Despite our extensive testing, perfection comes through feedback from students such as yourself. The refinement triggered by such feedback goes a long way in helping others improve faster and more efficiently.  

Thank you once again! 

Good luck with your applications!

- Performance analytics
- PACE engine and XPERT Analysis of quizzesWould make the product better:Communication channels:
- Typically, mentor-mentee interaction happens over mail (with an occasional VC). This leads to communication gaps at times
- I conveyed this to the team, and they were accommodating enough to adopt other modes on a case-to-case basisHi, members of the community,
I'll keep this review as relevant and concise as possible.
Context:
As a final-year engineering student, my GMAT journey was marked by a firmer grasp of the Quant and DI sections. The official mock I attempted confirmed this, revealing a weaker Verbal section score that needed attention.
I started seeking help; a few of the options I considered were [1] offline coaching, [2] self-study from official guides & [3] online courses.

Decision factors:
Since I had to balance my preparation along with my internship and studies, I decided to go for a self paced online course.
There are a few prominent online courses; I chose e-GMAT as it was recommended to me by a senior who scored a 740 on his GMAT (he still says that if I am unable to achieve after completing the course, the issue is with me and not the course)
Their free C.R. session solidified my decision to purchase the e-GMAT course. In this 2-hour section, we tackled a few assumption questions. I immediately noticed a change in my approach, leading to improved accuracy. This experience convinced me of the course's potential to enhance my Verbal section performance.
Additionally, they were decently priced and provided a flexible extension policy.

Verbal:
e-GMAT follows a pre-thinking approach for all CR questions and employs reading strategies for RC questions, which break something as elementary as reading a paragraph into steps, ensuring maximum absorption and processing, which helps achieve better accuracy while answering.

Quant:
They have this unique P.A.C.E. learning model, which adds and removes learning modules based on your existing foothold in the topic; this came in handy to me, given that I wanted to spend less time in this section learning concepts I was already familiar with.
It helped save my time here and improved the overall learning experience.

DI:
In the early days of GFE, the DI section of a course is what makes or breaks it. e-GMAT has done well in covering every aspect in detail, using innovative animations and infographics. It made learning exciting and smooth, as DI questions might sometimes get daunting.

Overall:
e-GMAT follows a unique question-first learning & application approach in each section, wherein you attempt a question, and then they teach you the right approach to solve it stepwise.

Lastly, through this review, I want to thank the entire team at e-GMAT and especially my mentor, Abha, who believed in me in times I didn't.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=17#","4","0","","","March 14, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi samarth_g,

The targeted improvement plans and encouragement serve as constant support to reach your target score. The Scholaranium is a very powerful tool with excellent questions of great quality and the data generated is very useful for targeted improvementI was a student of e-GMAT prior to the pandemic, after which I took a break in my preparation. I re-started my prep in June 2023, with a target of a 740+ score in mind.  Soon, I realized that I was nowhere close to my score since I was scoring in the late 600s and I wrote a frantic mail to e-GMAT to help me with the last mile push. This is when I was first introduced to Rashmi, one of the mentors at e-GMAT, who remained a constant backbone over the next couple of months and helped me score a 740 (V41 Q49).
Verbal had always been my strong suit, but I was quite weak in quant, which was pulling my score down. Rashmi crafted a quant improvement plan for me based on my strengths and weaknesses as displayed by the data on the e-GMAT portal. The PACE guided modules were extremely helpful to go through all the concepts and application files I needed. She helped me realize that while I was clear on most concepts, my process skills needed to be honed, for which she crafted a personalized improvement plan. The methodical plan, helpful content, and constant practice on the e-GMAT portal helped me improve from a Q45/46 to a Q49/50, and this is what I consider my biggest achievement. 
For Verbal, while I was historically strong in the section, there were certain areas that needed to be improved to achieve my target score. The meaning-based sentence correction approach really helped me minimize my mistakes and helped me become a better reader, which ultimately assisted in the CR and RC sections. 
I found e-GMAT’s scholaranium to be one of the most helpful tools for my practice, since I was constantly able to take custom quizzes as per the plan designed and review my performance based on the data recorded. It very accurately identified all my weak areas, enabling me to work and improve on them. I think the biggest contributor to my score was the constant personalized support from Rashmi and the e-GMAT team, who continuously pushed me to keep at my preparation and become better. During my preparation, I would write to them very frequently and would always get a response within 24 hours. This really helped me to remain motivated to practice every day and manage the preparation along with my hectic working hours.

Hello everyone! I recently took my GMAT exam on January 31st and scored 710. My preparation journey was quite lengthy and perhaps unconventional, involving multiple attempts before my latest endeavor, which fell on the final date of the current edition of the GMAT. Throughout this process, I gained invaluable insights, and I'm eager to share some of those, particularly highlighting the significant role that e-gmat played in helping me attain that score. I underwent a lengthy self preparation journey that did not result in achieving my target score. After reading several positive reviews on GMAT Club and participating in some excellent YouTube live sessions by them, I made the decision to choose e-gmat for my preparation, and I'm extremely grateful that I did.


My section wise improvement:

Verbal:

I believe an important aspect for scoring well in Verbal is building the skill of comprehension. It took me some time, but eventually, reading passages with the genuine aim of comprehension rather than superficially became second nature to me. Visualizing the provided information and forming logical connections while reading eventually became a non-negotiable process, significantly altering the way I grasped CR and RC passages. The process of ‘Pre-thinking’ in CR helped me improve my timing in CR questions and also reject incorrect answer choices on solid grounds. 

Quant:

Considering my background in engineering, I almost completely ignored preparing for Quant section in my previous attempts. Everytime, scoring a Q42. For my latest attempt, I went through every Quant module given in the course. While solving questions, I noticed that, like many others, I was making errors in questions I knew how to solve! I referred to these errors as 'silly' mistakes. After this, I realized the importance of ‘process skills’ in quant as well. I changed the way I solved quant questions, laying stress on consciously making sure all cases are covered, explicitly writing constraints while reading the question stem, etc. 

Specific areas of the course that benefited me:

1. The course content is comprehensive and very well structured. I personally believe that if you do this course right, follow the exact learning process diligently, you will see  a remarkable transformation in your performance. The structured approach to learning was instrumental in facilitating my learning journey.

2. E-gmat emphasizes a lot on skill-building over mere content absorption. Towards the end of the course aside from one or two topics, I didn't find it necessary to revisit the course material, as such.

3. Scholaranium : I can't stress enough the significance of this platform in evaluating and analyzing my progress. It provided all the data necessary for understanding my strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

4. Mentorship : Shout out to Akash for mentoring me in the final days of my prep. Every step was personally structured towards filling my process gaps and test readiness! It was not just about giving mocks, it was about giving tests / quizzes the right way! 

Some tips:

1. Maintain an error log! I maintained a very detailed error log with detailed notes on where I faltered and corrective actions. This error log became my only source for revision in the later stages of prep. I used ‘notion’ for this.
2. As an e-gmat student, I would say, trust the process, it works! Look, the course is lengthy, time consuming and feels daunting at first. Halfway through the learning phase, I got overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content that was left to consume and the time I had taken to complete the first half of it. I already felt exhausted. But, I continued with the course, taking breaks at appropriate intervals. I realized it was best for me to take my time and do things the right way. 
3. Do not attempt GMAT unprepared. This might sound trivial to most, but some of us have a different approach to giving exams! :P There are no shortcuts to GMAT and I feel you need to be prepared for every scenario : order of questions, super hard RC passage right in the middle of the test etc. Giving mocks is a great way to analyze such gaps and be prepared for it. Keep calm, exercise. A lot has to go right to achieve a score that accurately reflects your true potential.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=17#","3","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

- their approach of first doing the courses in which you need the most improvement (for me this was Quant and DI), and then engage into cementing, is the most efficient approach to actually learn from your mistakes and ensure you understand how to come to a solution as quickly as possible 
- the video solutions on the Scholaranium platform are clear and to the point: in a few minutes they explain how to solve an exercise, every time with their stepwise approach (think about constraints, visualize, make inferences etc.)Would make the product better:- each webinar re-explains what their platform consists of and how it works, which is very useful in the beginning, but after a while it may be a bit repetitive for students who have already purchased an e-GMAT course and therefore know the process
- it could be an idea to design different webinars for the students who already subscribed (as opposed to those who just want a try-out webinar)I recently had the pleasure of undertaking the e-GMAT course package to prepare for the GMAT, and the experience was nothing short of transformative. Initially, I purchased the course without a clear study plan, feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. I just made exercises and looked at the solutions, without any perspective of where I was going or how I could improve. However, my journey took a positive turn when Payal, an e-GMAT instructor, reached out to me. Her guidance played a pivotal role in my success.

One of the standout features of e-GMAT is the personalized study plan, tailored to my specific needs and timeframe. With only 12 days until my GMAT exam, Payal meticulously outlined a daily plan that focused on my weaknesses and targeted areas for improvement. This level of personalized attention set the tone for my entire preparation. The study plan was well-balanced, and Payal well understood that I was willing to work very hard in the short time I had, but still also considered it important to rest and process everything I had learned. 

The e-GMAT course encompasses a variety of specialized features, each contributing to a comprehensive and effective study experience. The PACE architecture in the quant course allowed me to efficiently navigate through the material, focusing on key areas that led to a significant improvement in my quant score from Q73 to Q83. The structured approach helped me avoid unnecessary content and concentrate on what was essential for achieving my goal. 

As for the RC section, Payal encouraged me to analyze data and identify root causes of each passage, and spend more time reading a passage, as compared to my previous practice approach. This change in attitude proved instrumental in enhancing my performance in RC, showcasing the effectiveness of e-GMAT's methodical approach.

The course's emphasis on Data Interpretation through Scholaranium significantly boosted my confidence in this challenging section. 

Test readiness was a crucial aspect of the last steps of my e-GMAT journey. After having followed the courses of Quant and DI with the PACE architecture, I had acquired the mindset needed to approach the GMAT confidently. The only thing that remained was build up my stamina and prepare for the actual exam. e-GMAT's error log was also really helpful in this, as it helped me recognize where I could improve my timing, as well as how to avoid stupid mistakes and identify questions that I was confident in and which not (and self-knowledge is very important during the GMAT prep).

In summary, my experience with e-GMAT was exceptional, and the results spoke for themselves—an impressive 60-point improvement in just 12 days. The personalized study plan, specialized features, and focused approach to weaknesses in quant, RC, and DI all contributed to my success. I highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone seeking a structured, personalized, and effective GMAT preparation course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=17#","1","0","","","","","",""

Quant course: comprehensive, detailed, high-yield for test performance.
Verbal course: innovative and effective strategies to master reading comprehension, critical reasoning and to optimise time expenditure on long reading paragraphs.
Scholaranium: question bank and online quiz/test simulator, with thousands of Quant & Verbal questions, categorized by each subsection and subtopic and by difficulty level. It is the quintessential gym for a student to train on questions and a crucial tool in the learning process required to master all GMAT sections.
SigmaXMocks: 5 GMAT exam practice tests, perfectly aligned with real-GMAT experience, accurately simulating real test score.Would make the product better:Providing a more accurate and personalized ""time-to-test-readiness"" projection, based on first Mock attempt, diagnostic quizzes, first learning modules studied and the student's studying agenda.Embarking on the GMAT journey as a medical professional presented unique challenges, given my decade-long hiatus from mathematics and limited exposure during high school. The quest for a comprehensive and effective GMAT preparation course led me to e-GMAT, an invaluable resource that played a pivotal role in my journey from a 550 to a remarkable 760.

1. Structured Learning with Quant course:
e-GMAT's Quant course was the bedrock of my success. The structured learning approach, with GMAT-like practice files and the crucial step of Cementing, went beyond mere content delivery. While initially skeptical about the stages of learning, I soon realized their significance. The methodology ensured a solid foundation for tackling hard-level questions.

2. Scholaranium:
Scholaranium became my home, gym, and rehearsal arena. It was not just a question bank but a comprehensive platform that allowed me to confront fears, gauge self-esteem, and measure progress accurately. The detailed explanations provided by e-GMAT tutors and discussions with fellow students were instrumental in guiding me towards mastery. Moreover data analysis and track record of performance over time allows you to know which areas to improve, at which level your preparation lies at any given moment, and when you are truly ready for test day.

3. Last Mile Program (LMP) and Mentorship:
The Last Mile Program, coupled with personalized mentorship from Rida Shafeek, was a game-changer. The program's strategic focus, coupled with Rida's insightful feedback, ensured my efforts and focus were aligned with the goal. External feedback from experts proved to be the catalyst for improvement, from both a test-performance and emotional level, offering a perspective that self-assessment could not provide alone.

4. Verbal Reinvention:
Recognizing the need to strengthen my verbal skills, I turned to e-GMAT's comprehensive verbal modules. Harshavardhan's teaching style and the emphasis on Pre-thinking skill not only improved my GMAT performance but also had positive repercussions on my real-life reading and comprehension skills.

5. Quality over Quantity:
e-GMAT's emphasis on quality learning over the quantity of questions attempted was a crucial revelation. The meticulous analysis of imperfections, saved in your Error Log, and scrutinized for underlying causes ensured a transformative learning experience. This approach was instrumental in my progression through learning stages and ultimately achieving mastery.

6. Realistic Mock Experiences:
Sigma-X Mocks provided an accurate simulation of the test environment. They highlighted the stark reality that performance in a controlled quiz setting doesn't necessarily mirror the high-stakes scenario. This awareness was crucial in managing expectations and refining my approach for test day.

7. Strategic Approach to Anxiety Management:
The strategic approach to anxiety management, particularly in the final days leading to the test, was a distinctive feature. Understanding that test day success requires a holistic approach—combining skill, calmness, focus, stamina, motivation, and resilience—was a pivotal realization.

In conclusion, my journey with e-GMAT was not just a trajectory of improving GMAT scores; it was a transformative experience. The structured learning, personalized mentorship, and emphasis on quality over quantity make e-GMAT a standout choice for any student, especially those facing unique challenges. If you seek a course that goes beyond content delivery, providing strategic guidance and a holistic approach to GMAT preparation, e-GMAT should be at the top of your list.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=17#","0","0","","","","","",""

•	Scholaranium 
•	Master Comprehension
•	Pre-Thinking in CR, Meaning based approach in SC
•	Last Mile Push programWould make the product better:Including the option to watch the videos at an increased speed will save prep timeThanks to e-GMAT, I went from a 580 (Sigma Mock) score to a GMAT 730. I am an orthodontist by profession and after years of dentistry, getting back into the examination mode was an uphill task. However, the mentorship I received from the e-GMAT team helped me achieve a 730 on the GMAT.

Improvement in Verbal Section: 
I followed the personalized study plan which was based on my diagnostic quiz results and my current skill set. After going through the concepts file I went ahead with the diagnostic and cementing quizzes. I improved from V 31 to V 41 in verbal. 
Reading Comprehension (RC) - Master Comprehension ably guides students about the importance of strategic pausing and following a structure-based approach. Both of these, according to me, are prerequisites for nailing hard RC passages.  Mastering this approach made a significant difference in my performance. 
Critical Reasoning –  On the suggestion of the mentors at e-GMAT, I followed the process of pre-thinking and was surprised to find out that I could solve most CR questions in under 1.5 minutes. I attribute my improved score majorly to adopting the process of pre-thinking. It helped me navigate through the tricky questions that the GMAT is known for, saving me precious time and making me avoid traps, especially in the harder questions.
Strategy for Sentence Correction –  
I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of following the Meaning Based Approach in Sentence Correction (SC). I lot of right answers in GMAT sound awkward and relying on what sounds right isn't going to help much. Following the meaning-based approach, on the other hand, made me more efficient at avoiding grammatically correct wrong answers. 

Improvement in Quant Section:
PACE tailors the course to the individual needs of every student and helped me save more than 40 hours on my Quant Prep.  Focusing on my weak areas as identified through Scholaranium, with the help of cementing and test readiness quizzes improved my Quant score significantly. 
Scholaranium was particularly vital in my preparation. Scholaranium's targeted practice questions and the analytical tools provided a structured approach to tackling my weaknesses. Data Insights is an invaluable tool in critically identifying weak areas and also offers the chance to track improvement. My mentor Rashmi helped me work on my flaws and play on my strengths. This was especially true for the Quant and CR sections, where I needed the maximum improvement.

Last Mile Push Program: 
The Last Mile Push Program in the final stages of my preparation helped me increase my score by 30 points (from my previous score of 700) in a matter of a few days and helped me score 730 (Q 48, V 41). Rashmi provided an objective view of my strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to focus on critical areas for improvement. Also, I would like to mention that the Sigma X Mock scores were within +/- 10 points of my actual GMAT score both times and were an accurate representation of where I stood in terms of my preparation. A balanced approach and trust in the e-GMAT methodology, including the tools and resources like Scholaranium, Pre-thinking approach in CR and the Structure-based approach in RC led to a significant improvement in my score. Overall, I would like to add that e-GMAT has everything one needs to ace the GMAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=17#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","In October 2022, my GMAT preparation journey began with three months of intensive self-study. But my first attempt brought me an underwhelming score of 680. That's when I realized that I needed more than just subject knowledge; I needed a different strategy. This realization led me to E-GMAT, discovered through a free SC masterclass that introduced me to a meaning-based approach. The masterclass along with a free mock test (along with its impressively detailed ESR report) and many positive reviews convinced me to give it a shot.

Coming from an engineering background, I always had decent score in quants. Verbal, however, was a struggle for me, especially Sentence Correction (God Bless GMAT Focus for getting rid of it!) which constituted 80% of my preparation time. E-GMAT's methodological approach provided clarity and structure to my thoughts when tackling such questions. This structured methodology became a reliable tool in decision-making, especially in those 700-800 level problems with trick answer choices. These approaches can broadly be divided as:
1.	SC: Meaning based approach.
2.	CR: Pre-thinking
3.	RC: Active reading
The flow of course is structured in such a way that each approach is further reinforced in subsequent sections. (e.g. Meaning based approach learned in SC helps decipher subtle changes in language's meaning in hard CR question. Similarly, Pre-thinking skill learnt in CR helps greatly while actively engaging with RC passages. 

After concept files, each section (i.e. SC, CR and RC)  has a cementing module and for me it was this section that made my investment in this program worth it. Learning and mastering approach is one thing, However, to be able to use it in actual test environment is an entirely different game. Cementing stage, as the name suggests, is aimed at cementing these approaches so that the same can be retained and applied in timed manner during actual test. 

After completing EMGAT Verbal module, In July 2023, I gave my second attempt. In this attempt I scored 720 (Q50 V38). Knowing I could do better, I decided to go for another attempt. However, due to various personal reasons I had to take a 5 month long break from my preparation. I resumed preparation for my final attempt in January 2024, just three weeks away from exam date. But because of cementing done earlier and detailed error log prepared during my previous attempt, I was able to complete all the the necessary preparation to get my desired score within time.

In summary, E-GMAT's structured approach, personalized mentorship and the transformative impact of Cementing were instrumental in achieving my target score. The program not only improved my understanding of various concepts, but also refined my application skills. And as per my experience, this “application of skills” part is where EGMAT stands unparalleled.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hello Everyone!

I recently embarked on the challenging journey of preparing for the GMAT, and I am thrilled to share that I achieved a score of 720. I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the e-GMAT team for their invaluable support throughout this process. In this comprehensive review, I'll share how e-GMAT's structured approach revolutionized my preparation and led to my success.

Mastering Skills of Verbal with e-GMAT's Structured Approach:
From the moment I decided to prepare for the GMAT, I knew I needed a comprehensive and structured course to guide me through the complexities of the exam. e-GMAT's Verbal course exceeded my expectations in every aspect. The journey began with the Master Comprehension module, which meticulously laid the foundation by dissecting the building blocks of sentences and instilling a profound understanding of the Meaning-Based Approach. This approach was truly a game-changer in Sentence Correction. In Critical Reasoning, the pre-thinking technique empowered me to anticipate answers before even glancing at the choices, significantly reducing the time taken to answer questions. In Reading Comprehension, the emphasis on understanding the passage itself proved invaluable, enabling me to tackle even the most challenging questions with confidence.

Efficiency and Effectiveness: The Role of Process and Analytics:
One of the unique features of e-GMAT's course is the PACE Engine, a personalized, adaptive course engine view that optimizes learning by focusing on individual weak areas. This innovative tool saved me considerable time. In Quant Section, the process skills that I developed helped me tackle any question type with ease. In addition, the three-stage preparation structure, particularly the Cementing Process, was instrumental in solidifying my understanding and ensuring mastery of concepts for both Verbal and Quant.
Scholaranium stands out as a remarkable platform within e-GMAT's arsenal, offering an array of features essential for thorough GMAT preparation. With a diverse range of questions spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels, Scholaranium provides an immersive learning experience that transcends conventional test prep methods. The quality of questions is exceptional, offering learning opportunities with each attempt. Whether you're tackling fundamental concepts or delving into advanced topics, every question presents an opportunity for growth and mastery. One of the standout features of Scholaranium is its robust analytics capabilities, which empower users to track their progress with precision. By monitoring metrics such as time taken to solve questions, accuracy rates, and performance trends across difficulty levels, users gain invaluable insights into their strengths and weaknesses. This data-driven approach facilitates targeted preparation, allowing users to focus on areas that require improvement and optimize their study strategies accordingly. The platform's analytics proved helpful during the crucial test readiness phase, enabling me to fine-tune my preparation. Scholaranium is a must-have resource for anyone serious about mastering the GMAT.

Balancing Work and Studies: Personalized Support and Study Plans:
As a working professional juggling multiple commitments, the Last Mile Program offered by e-GMAT was a godsend. My mentor, Akash, provided a meticulous roadmap, covering every aspect of preparation from learning to stamina development for the exam. I cannot overstate the significance of the support I received from my mentor, who not only crafted detailed plans but also offered unwavering encouragement and motivation throughout my journey. The regular check-ins and customized resources such as study material, videos etc. played a pivotal role in keeping me on track, even during challenging times.

Comprehensive Support and Realistic Simulation:
The support provided by e-GMAT's Subject Matter Experts was unparalleled. Their ability to simplify complex concepts and provide tailored guidance was invaluable in addressing my doubts and enhancing my understanding. The SigmaX Mocks served as a true simulation of the actual test environment, allowing me to devise strategies and gauge my readiness effectively. With the guidance of my mentor, Akash, I felt supported every step of the way, from crafting study plans to overcoming self-doubt.

Final Recommendation: Why e-GMAT Is the Ultimate Choice:
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend e-GMAT to anyone serious about GMAT preparation. Its structured approach, comprehensive support, and innovative tools offer everything one could ask for in an effective preparation course. Whether you're a working professional seeking flexibility or a student aiming for excellence, e-GMAT is the ultimate choice for achieving your GMAT goals.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Unlike other products, E-GMAT helped me a lot in the verbal section in a very structured approach!Would make the product better:Nothing it is perfectE-GMAT. Hands down the best platform I have encountered. After trying 2 other famous providers, solving all the OG questions multiple times and attempting the GMAT examination three times, I was introduced to the E-GMAT platform by a friend who managed to secure a 760 by studying with E-GMAT. To be honest I was frustrated and lost before encountering E-GMAT. Nothing would work for me especially in the verbal section. Prior to E-GMAT, I did not even know that there was a structured methodology to deal with the verbal section. Having dyslexia, I could not navigate in an adequate manner through the RC passages. CR was a nightmare as I didn’t know how to approach the questions and extrapolate a solution. SC was convoluted. Long story short the verbal section was chaotic. First thing I did when I purchased my E-GMAT subscription of GMAT Online on Dec 2nd, 2023, was to let go of everything I had done and go through all the sections in detail. For me the real game changer was the learnings deduced from the Verbal teachings. SC was a hard section for me as I thought that by relying solely on grammar I would prevail in the test. I couldn’t be more wrong. E-GMAT taught me that meaning is the most important factor that separates the great from the best in SC. The strategies that I learned and employed helped me deduce the meaning in SC texts and master the concept. In CR the most important methodology that I learned was the pre-thinking approach. This approach is a groundbreaking approach that no other platform teaches. This approach teaches how to arrive at solid answers before even looking at the solutions. With this methodology I was able to navigate through the CR questions in a structured manner and greatly improve my ability in solving CR questions. Last but not least I had to deal with my arch enemy, the RC. It was a living nightmare in the beginning. The vast texts seemed undefeatable. However, in the master and reading comprehension sections I learned how to deduce meaning, increase my comprehension and cruises through texts in the most efficient manner possible. I cannot stress it enough, the E-GMAT was a game changer in the verbal section!!!!! When it comes to quant, the PACE software enabled me to be time efficient with the topics I knew well and save precious time, time that I would dedicate later on mastering medium and hard questions. Before E-GMAT I thought that I could tackle hard questions in an efficient manner. That was not true. The quant problems faced in E-GMAT are way harder than OG. Although I faltered a lot in the beginning, I trusted the process and pushed forward. One thing that other platforms lacked was a detailed explanation of the answer. At E-GMAT the methodology of arriving at the solutions is crystal clear for each question! As I said the content was challenging but there are only things to gain by training yourself with hard questions. It is always better to be prepared for the worse. Moving on E-GMAT highlighted the significance of maintaining an error log. Knowledge comes from revising errors and avoiding repeating mistakes. Moreover, Scholaranium is the perfect place to hones one’s skills. Scholaranium is a platform embedded in the E-GMAT that analyzes every single parameter of one’s attempts. It provides useful insights on matters that deem improvement. In addition to the above E-GMAT fosters a program called the Last Mile Push for ambitious students that are willing to do everything in their power to achieve success. In this program one is assigned a mentor that provides guidance on how to improve. I was very fortunate to be assigned with Rashmi. What can I say. Anything stated would be an understatement. Rashmi helped me on a daily basis to unlock my potential and rise above any previous performance. This mentorship elevated my skills and confidence at a level previously unimaginable. Having honed my skills through cementing and custom quizzes and having utilized the data analytics that Scholaranium offers I was ready to head on to the mock phase. At this point it is worth mentioning that in the first mock that I took before I started with my preparation, I scored a 620. After a month of preparation, I was able to score consistently above 700. Every time that I took a mock and gazed at the results, I felt confident but also felt motivated to improve even further. With the invaluable guidance of Rashmi and my persistence, I was able to score a 700 on test day. That’s an 80 point improvement in a months’ time guys! It is fair to say that without E-GMAT and Rashmi I wouldn’t be able to perform at such a high level. If you ask me if E-GMAT is worth it, I will respond definitely. Every aspect of the platform is about unlocking one’s potential with the aim of dominating the real deal. I feel that I could not materialize my dreams of getting admitted into a good business school with out E-GMAT.  By and large if you are wondering whether to proceed with E-GMAT, I am urging you to do so as you won’t be disappointed. My closing remarks are: follow exactly everything that you are instructed to do in the manner you are instructed even if it may seem redundant and pay close attention on how to parse information on the error log as it will help you improve on a scaling manner. The insights in verbal and quant, the methodology employed, and the guidance of Rashmi are what helped me achieve 700. Seeing consistent improvement is an unparalleled feeling and I did not see any consistency in my improvement prior to enrolling at the E-GMAT platform.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The Last Mile Push (LMP) program offers a comprehensive strategy for GMAT preparation. It presents a well-organized approach that targets and improves our weaknesses in both verbal and quant sections. This program not only builds a strong foundation but also alleviates exam fatigue and test fear.Would make the product better:LMP utilizes email interactions as its primary mode of communication. However, occasional in-person interactions can enhance the overall effectiveness of the course.I started my GMAT preparations in November 2022. I enrolled in a prep platform where I practiced for about 2.5 months. Despite my efforts, my first attempt in January 2023 yielded a score of only 610 (V25, Q49). Time posed a challenge in the verbal section. Believing that practicing more questions in a timed setting would enhance my verbal score, I began taking as many mock tests as I could (Later, I realized that this was the biggest mistake I did during my GMAT prep). I took the exam again in March 2023. Unfortunately, it resulted in a disappointing score of 620 (V28, Q48). It became evident that my struggle in the verbal section was rooted in a lack of conceptual understanding.

In pursuit of a 700 score, I enrolled with e-GMAT in April 2023. From the outset, the impact was noticeable, particularly with the effective meaning-based approach in Sentence Correction (SC) and Reading Comprehension (RC). By the end of June 2023, I completed the verbal course, scoring near 690 in Sigma mocks. With renewed confidence, I scheduled my exam for July 18, 2023, aiming for MBA intakes in September 2023 or January 2024. Despite feeling well-prepared, exam anxiety affected my performance in the verbal section, resulting in a score of 670 (V31, Q49), falling short of my 700 target. 

Realizing the need for guidance, I reached out to the e-GMAT team post-exam. They enrolled me in the LMP program for free, assigning Dhruv as my mentor. However, due to work commitments, I couldn't immediately commence the LMP program after my exam. Professional commitments consistently caused interruptions and diverted my focus during my GMAT preparation. Eventually, I was able to commence the LMP program in October 2023. LMP provided a high level of structure and instilled discipline in my preparation—a quality I had been lacking until then. I systematically completed sections one by one and surpassed a set threshold scores in each to progress. Although I faced challenges in Critical Reasoning (CR), continuous support from Dhruv helped me surmount this hurdle. While verbal remained the focal point, I revisited quant modules before the exam, and that proved to be sufficient.

I scheduled my exam for 15th January, 2024, approximately one year after my initial attempt. In the final days leading up to the exam, intense work pressure posed a significant challenge to my preparations. However, Dhruv and the e-GMAT team provided commendable support during this critical period. Upon taking the exam, seeing the score (700 - V34 & Q50) on the screen left me feeling satisfied and content. The LMP program proved effective for those aiming to surpass the 700 mark as it provides a structured approach and in-depth understanding of concepts. I wholeheartedly recommend LMP to those struggling to break the 700 barrier. My gratitude goes to e-GMAT, especially Dhruv, for being a guiding force in my GMAT journey. Best wishes to e-GMAT and all those preparing for the exam.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","","","","","",""

The cementing sections helped to further enhance and solidify the concepts.
The mentoring support is wonderful, which was provided to me voluntarily looking at my weak cementing scores. The additional recorded sections to watch are curated individually looking at the weakness of the studentWould make the product better:Sometimes in the mentoring feedback, they ask to go through the complete concept files which are time taking and sometimes un-necessary, as the level of questions in the cementing and concepts is very different and will not address the weakness in difficult questions.

The number of mock test available are very few.Hi All,
I had subscribed to the E-Gmat course after taking trying out their trial which I felt was very interactive and focused on building the focus on improving core-skills rather than just practice a number of questions. I’m happy with the support provided by E-Gmat which helped me improve my score by about 100 points in 2 months.
I believe if I had time for preparation for 1 more month, with the assistance of E-Gmat, I could have scored much higher, as I couldn’t try to optimise my test taking strategy and cementing for Quant and DI section.
I had started the E-GMAT subscription after observing no much improvement in score trying one month of self-preparation with the OG material. I had realised that Verbal is the weakest section that I had to work on, and decided to spend maximum time for it. 
The E-Gmat for approach Verbal section was very different from what I used to follow and had largely improved my accuracy. What I loved about the course is, they not only explain the process, but make us try to inculcate them as our behaviour through their practice and application files. If we can apply them, be assured that your accuracy will improve. Inculcating this new behaviour had initially affected my speed, but eventually practice was able to pick up.
Their cementing sessions are quite challenging, but also help us asses with our speed. What I liked about E-GMAT was, I had tried 2 cementing steps but failed. I didn’t know what to do, and had requested for strategic support to E-GMAT. They had assigned me with a mentor, who had guided me and provided me with additional plans and material to ensure that I was able to apply the suggested method to solve in given time. Frankly, it took a lot more time than what I expected, which made me restless, but now that I see, I feel they were worth investing time in.
The Quant section consisted of concept and process building sections. The PACE features gives us diagnostic test to check our and suggests to skip the concept files which we are strong. This helps us save lot of time, and I suggest that they have to extend this service to the DI as well.
Though I couldn’t complete the cementing phase in EGMAT, the constant traps laid out in the process file helped me be very alert in the GMAT Exam. 
The skills which I developed in Verbal and Quant(like approximation) helped me develop the required skill for DI. However, I suggest those taking the package to go through the DI module as well.
In general, I feel the E-GMAT course is for those who believes that they need to build the core skills and are ready to invest 3 months of time.
 It’ll be difficult for someone whos targeting high score within one month as skill developing takes time. If someone has good conceptual understanding and looking for only cementing and test taking strategy, I believe, they can complete within one month. 
And don’t shy away to ask for mentorship, they have good mentors who can monitor your progress and help you improve your score. One more suggestion I would like to give the EGMAT team is that to increase the number of Sigma Mock tests for the GMAT Focus edition. As of now, only 3 are available, of which most of them consume the first one before the subscription of the program","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","","","January 30, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi gokrish,

Consistent support from the strategy team
Coffee sessions with Rajat and PayalWould make the product better:PACE style optimization for Verbal sectionA note before I start my review-
I followed the e-gmat plan exactly how the team guided me. I struggle with certain test taking anxiety but I have a decent score now to apply to the B-schools of my choice. Although, I believe that I am capable of 20 more points in overall score but because of shortage of time, I am applying with my current score.

E-gmat’s master comprehension course helped in building a strong foundation for verbal. All the modules are detailed. Initially, I felt that cementing quizzes were unnecessarily slowing down my progress, but I instead focused on trusting the process, which helped me in the long run. The cementing quizzes did bring out all the fallacies I had and helped me to rectify them. In hindsight, I am happy that I endured the pain during that stage. I felt that I improved immensely in reading comprehension because of e-gmat. Usually, people think that RC is the most time-consuming, but if it is done as per how e-gmat teaches then I feel RC becomes a strength and helps with time during the test. P.S. the verbal techniques and strategies also helped me immensely while writing essays for my applications.
In Quant, I was strong when I started. Though, the course helped me mainly in Word Problems section. PACE helped me to move along the Quant course and cementing quickly.
Having individually prepared for all sub-modules and test readiness quizzes, I attempted my mocks. I realized that I falter when I apply all the learnings together. Rida and the strategy expert team helped me by designing focused practice plan and that improved my score. I also learned a lot from the already answered queries for some questions by the subject matter experts. These queries helped me a lot during my last stage of the preparation to iron out any doubts I had.
I benefited from the coffee sessions by Rajat and Payal. They showed the growth stats which helped me mentally, bolstering my understanding that my progress and potential are in place. All that was needed was to calmly sail through the exam. I am happy that I signed up with e-gmat for my gmat preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=18#","0","0","","","","","",""

Sigma X mock testsWould make the product better:Include an option to watch lessons at 1.25X or 1.5X so that students can speed-up the preparation processHi Everyone!
In my 2nd attempt of GMAT, I scored 690, a 90 point improvement from my 1st attempt which was based mainly on self-preparation. After my 1st attempt, I realised the need for a more structured way of preparation which is when I came across the e-GMAT free trial. I really loved the way their course was designed and immediately signed up for the Online focused prep. A detailed review of each section -

Quant - Since I was familiar with the basic concepts of quant, the PACE time saving method was really effective in helping me identify the basic modules that I could skip. The concept + test based method of preparation actually instilled confidence after every topic. The questions from e-GMAT might seem more difficult than those from the official guide, however, one should solve these questions as it thoroughly clears your basic concepts and improves your speed drastically. However, ""Word Problems"" was the only section where I felt that the solutions were extremely lengthy and this approach could not be practically used in the exam.

Verbal - The meaning based approach for SC and pre-thinking approach for CR were a game changer. I initially took some time to get comfortable with these methods, which late on fared me well. Plus, the cementing quiz after each section gave a fair picture of my time bound performance and the extra-efforts that I needed to put to ace the topics. Also, the last mile program with a dedicated mentor helped me understand my weaknesses at a granular level and build strategies around them.

Lastly, I found the Scholaranium and the Sigma-X mock tests to be particularly impressive. The Sigma-X mocks were very much in line with the kind of/level of questions one might encounter in the exam. The mocks actually helped me hone my time management skills, and fine-tune my strategies around each question type.

Scholaranium
Sigma-X mock testsWould make the product better:-Hello everyone!
I took the GMAT in July 2023 and scored a 760 (Q49, V44). This was my second attempt and had a 50-point improvement from my previous score of 710 (Q49, V38).

With a strong quantitative background as an engineer, I confidently handled strategies and time management for the quant section. However, the verbal section posed a challenge. Despite grasping grammar concepts for SC and the structure of CR questions, I struggled with accuracy. I was keen on exploring strategies online to improve my accuracy.  That's when I discovered the eGMAT workshops before my first attempt. The meaning-based approach (SC) and pre-thinking (CR) strategies stood out as highly beneficial.

Unfortunately, time constraints prevented me from fully implementing these strategies in my initial attempt. So while choosing a new prep material, eGMAT was a no-brainer. Having exhausted the OG guides in my first attempt, I sought a fresh set of questions to refine my strategy. The 2-month GMAT Intensive course not only met but exceeded my expectations, playing a crucial role in my achievement of a 760. The personalized study plan and test analysis with Mansi from eGMAT proved invaluable in structuring my study schedule for the next two months.

I found the Scholaranium and the Sigma-X mock tests to be particularly noteworthy. The sectional tests, with adjustable topic and difficulty filters, were invaluable for refining my approach to different GMAT question types. Utilizing this option significantly contributed to enhancing both my accuracy and speed, resulting in a notable 6-point improvement in my verbal score
The mock tests accurately simulated the GMAT exam environment, enabling me to hone my time management skills and build confidence. The detailed performance analytics helped me identify areas for further refinement, allowing me to fine-tune my preparation strategy as needed.

Overall, eGMAT’s strategies and question banks proved invaluable in boosting my GMAT score significantly. I highly recommend this course to anyone seeking a comprehensive and effective GMAT preparation experience.


Here are some tips GMAT prep:

DO NOT BLINDLY SOLVE THE QUESTIONS. A crucial lesson from my experience is that the quantity of questions solved does not necessarily correlate with exam performance. Whether you solve a few or many questions, conduct a thorough analysis of the solutions, regardless of whether you answered correctly. Extracting shortcuts and key insights from these analyses will significantly enhance accuracy and substantially reduce the time needed.

ENSURE THAT YOU PRACTICE YOUR APPROACH/STATEGY TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF QUESTIONS. In the majority of GMAT questions, eliminating 3 out of 5 options is often straightforward. However, when faced with the final two options, selecting the correct one demands the right strategy. Each question type requires a distinct approach, so delve into each category and familiarize yourself with the application of your techniques.


All the best to everyone attempting the exam.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=19#","1","0","","","January 30, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi meghanarrajan,

I used e-GMAT's course for the exam preparation. I took 2 months to prep for the exam. Some notes on the overall experience:

1. Quant:
I am an engineering undergrad working in finance, so I was confident in my quant skills. However, Hard quant questions can lead to time-drain if you do not know some essential tricks to solve the question faster or eliminate wrong answer choices. So, if you are starting at a higher ability in quant, revising these tricks can increase confidence by improving time management. I referred to e-GMAT's course materials / videos for these and practised some Medium and Hard questions from the OG. Overall in the actual exam, I solved all questions with 7mins to spare. I reviewed all answer choices but was confident in most. Thankfully, I got all the questions correct.

2. Verbal:
I dedicated 50-60% of my prep time to this section. e-GMAT's materials were helpful and their Question Bank (Scholaranium) is quite advanced. I learned techniques like Pre-thinking and honed my skills through their Cementing and Ability quizzes. However, I could not attempt all the questions in the Scholaranium or the OG due to the short 2-month prep time. I made a few consecutive mistakes in the exam which led to an 81/90.

3. Data Insights:
What a tricky section! Not sure if I was a bit exhausted since I came to this section after Q and V or if the section itself was tricky. Anyway, for DI, I had some familiarity with the different question types (TPA, MSR, DS, etc) in the section but struggled a lot with time management. I think I guessed the last 2 questions in the exam. Due to the no-partial-credit nature of the questions, time-drain is common for questions which you know you can get right. e-GMAT has a lot of DI questions in their Scholaranium and the course materials. I took this section up at the end of my prep and kind of hurried through it since I thought Q and V skills were transferrable to this section [not an excuse for the score ;) ].","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=19#","1","0","","","","","",""

In quants too, you were able to leverage the P.A.C.E. feature to identify and fix your areas of weakness. This strategic approach not only helped you save over 40 hours of prep time but also helped you get to the 95th percentile in quants. From the below image we can see that your Scholaranium stats predicted your success in Quant:

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:(1) Exceptional Learning Platform focused on skill and metholody
(2) Extensive question bank and skill cementing approach (Scholanarium)
(3) Unparalleled Mentoring and true commitment to their students´ successI embarked on my GMAT preparation journey with a modest 560 mock-up score, balancing a full-time executive job. Within five months, eGMAT transformed my approach and gave me all necessary skills, leading me to achieve a very satisfying 655, above my initial target. Here's why I highly recommend eGMAT:

(1)	Exceptional Learning Platform: eGMAT's platform is a testament to their vast experience in GMAT preparation. The course is meticulously designed, prioritizing skill learning over mere practice. The guided learning path eliminates the guesswork of what to study each day, ensuring mastery of concepts and methodologies essential for scoring high. As a non-native English speaker, the verbal section was really scary at start… But the eGMAT course was a game-changer for me, boosting my confidence and skills (especially mastering comprehension course, capacity to identify question type and apply prethinking methodology), and placing me in the 99th percentile in the verbal section! The math courses, too, were instrumental in rejuvenating my long-forgotten high school math skills, with comprehensive coverage of all exam aspects. Finally, despite it is very recent, eGMAT provided detailed course and extensive practice materials for the Data Insights section.

(2)	The Scholaranium - A Treasure of Practice: eGMAt provide access to what they call the Scholanarium which is an extensive question bank, a vital tool for cementing methodologies. It offers possibility to create custom quizzes to focus on defined level of question, defined area of a section, to focus on timing or on the topic, it helps you as well to keep you error log and every question comes with a very detailed explanation on methodology. Also, you can write down on any question for further detail and personalized answer. Everytime I did, I had an answer in less than 12 hours... This feature alone is a huge time-saver and an invaluable resource.

(3)	Unparalleled Mentoring: eGMAT's mentoring system is what truly sets them apart in my opinion. From day one, I was assigned a mentor (Rashmi). I can now say she was instrumental in my success. Her guidance on study rhythm, identifying areas of improvement, and short-term action plans were pivotal. More than that, her unwavering mental and motivational support helped me navigate the emotional ups and downs of GMAT prep. GMAT is a mental roller coaster and having people by your side who unconditionally believe in you, motivate you, and give you the keys to come back stronger, is priceless. After every preparation, every mock up, Rashmi was there to help me to understand the areas to improve, how to prepare for the next one,... up to the preparation of the exam day. Also I have to mention I was really surprised, and it says a lot about eGMAT, when Rajat, the founder himself, started to personally contact me to understand on what I was struggling, giving me crucial last mile one to one coaching and sending regular messages to ensure the best attitude for test day. I can´t see any stronger testament to their commitment to student success.

GMAT preparation is an arduous journey requiring time, energy, and mental fortitude. But with eGMAT's exceptional support, methodology, tools, and dedicated team, I navigated this path successfully. A heartfelt thanks to the entire eGMAT team, especially Rashmi and Rajat, for their unparalleled support.

Recommendation: Without any hesitation, I recommend eGMAT to all GMAT aspirants. Their comprehensive approach and personalized support make a significant difference!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=19#","0","0","","","January 03, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Moulio,  

A hearty congratulations on a well-earned 655😊 What a journey it has been, and I am so glad that you have been able to surpass your target score in this attempt! It has been a pleasure working with you during this journey! 

I am really glad to hear that you enjoyed our learning platform. Your improvement from the 26th percentile to the 99th percentile in verbal is a testament to the effort that you put into making the most of the platform. See how despite the challenges of being a non-native speaker, you were able to improve to an exceptional verbal score:

It is great to know that you found the quant and the DI courses equally effective. As you have rightly mentioned, DI is a new course, and it is important to have a course that is comprehensive and equips you with all the skills needed to excel in DI, and also provides sufficient questions for practice. It is heartening to know that you did not feel the need to refer to any other material on DI and the material on the platform was sufficient for you to reach an enviable score of D82.  

It is not just enough to build a rock-solid foundation. To get a top score on the GMAT, you need to excel in applications; for this, you need to practice on great quality questions. Not only that, but you also need tools that help you identify and fix any pockets of weaknesses. It is really commendable how you leveraged the Scholaranium to do targeted practice that helped you excel across the sub-sections. See how this data-driven approach helped you not only improve your accuracy to 79% in word problems but also helped reduce the overall time to 1min 54 seconds:

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The master comprehension course is very important to make realize that I need to have a different approach to effectively read and not have to reread several times and thus not waste valuable time. And the meaning approach for SC changed my whole perspective and improved my accuracy a lot. For CR, the process skills of Pre-Thinking are truly a game changer. I know you have read this several times BUT I TELL YOU once more: You need to learn how to Pre-Think in order to not fall into traps that the answer choices intend for you all the time. I also think that the process that eGmat advocates is hugely effective. You learn concepts thoroughly, you get tested on these topics and after you get done with the modules, you need to Cement your knowledge, which tests your process skills of all topics under a timed environment. This showed me which concepts I did not understand completely and processes that I need to master.Would make the product better:I really like the mocks, and I am so amazed that I even got the same section scores and result in my real GMAT so they are very accurate. But I think I would like to have a better website design/layout to assimilate the real GMAT so that I can prepare mentally for the big day.I am really happy to say that I got reached a 690 (V37 Q48) in GMAT. I almost lost hope since I started preparing more than a year ago on my own to only get a 640 and nothing above of that in my two previous tries.
On my first try I got a 640 in my GMAT Online (V28 Q48). Since my main problem was clearly Verbal, I thought that I just needed to make sure I study more concepts and practice more SC questions and try to memorize more idioms. After a while I just got even more stressed in my preparation because I sometimes got stuck and waste too much time in some SC and CR questions. Specially for CR questions, once I checked the official explanation, it made sense, but it did not help me to get the next (new) CR argument right. In my next try of GMAT Online I got really nervous and that affected me to a degree that I got an even lower score. I believe that I got nervous because I was also aware that I had no solid process for CR questions. I realized that I could not improve further unless I learn and apply strategies to get more Verbal questions correct. I had read many reviews of different courses and I found that eGMAT was recognized for being one of the best in Verbal and I like the fact that it offered an online platform with modules since I can access the course and keep studying for as many hours as I can. 
I got a 590 in my diagnostic mock of eGMAT and I realized that I was rusty and I had a lot of work to do. I even thought for a moment that it was impossible to get close to 700 in 2 months. But I did! I reached almost a 700 in just 2.5 months.

I think that the biggest tip I got from e-GMAT is that hard consistent work get results. You have to be motivated and resilient if you truly want a 700+. I have read that other people had the same section scores and got a 700, and even though it may sound frustrating, I am sure that I am very close to the 700 and that with a bit more hard work I can make it and get 700+ in a couple of weeks.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=20#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

For Quant, The PACE Engine allows you to drill deep into your weaker areas and quickly skim through topics you are already strong in.

For DI, Visualisation is key to solve questions efficiently within time constraints, something that is extensively taught and applied.Thanks to the E-GMAT Team, I was able to improve my scores from a starting ability of 650 to a 715 on the GMAT Focus. I would recommend  every aspiring candidate to try out the EGMAT course as they have a step-by-step guide to sure shot success on the GMAT, irrespective of your starting ability.

A 120-point improvement is a rare feat that needs a herculean effort and endless commitment from one’s end.

The most commendable part of your journey is ‘the simplicity’ with which you went about it. You went through your prep in the recommended 3-stage sequence.

7. Sigma X Mock software is similar to an official GMAT test and the analytics can help you prepare better.Would make the product better:Recorded lectures can get monotonous. However, e-GMAT provides free lectures regularly by top experts on crucial topics.I decided to start my GMAT prep in April 2022 and purchased e-GMAT’s Online 360 program. In the first diagnostic mock that I gave before any preparation, I scored a 580. As a beginner, this phase was all about building my foundation and I started going through all the concept files, with the help of the personalized study plan. Due to multiple factors such as my college studies getting restarted in an offline mode post-pandemic, lack of consistency, and suffering from a health issue just a week before the exam, I messed up my first attempt. I scored a 610 (Q47 V27 IR8 AWA6). Clearly, verbal was a big issue. I took some time off to reassess why I had gone wrong and waited for my college studies to end. 

Cut to July 2023, I reached out to the GMAT Strategy Team with my vision and with an analysis of my shortcomings. The team is very supportive. They analyzed my mistakes and advised me to give a mock again. I scored a 700 in this diagnostic mock. I repurchased the course and started the steps that the strategy team had prepared for me. The first crucial area where e-GMAT helped me the most was my Verbal. RC is my natural strength and that wasn't a worry. SC was my Achilles heel. As per the advice of the strategy team, I went over the concepts of SC again and this time, I truly understood them. Then I performed proper cementing via cementing quizzes to ensure that I can reciprocate the skills I’ve learned. e-GMAT’s detailed approach to SC as well as their pre-thinking approach for CR have helped me a lot. 

Secondly, the dedicated OG and Scholaranium sections have played a pivotal role in preparing me for the official exam. For my 2nd attempt, I thoroughly utilized both the Scholaranium and the OG. The strategy team advised me regularly with a structured approach to balance my preparation between scholaranium quizzes and OG quizzes. Doing this built my proficiency in GMAT quant, made me regain my confidence in GMAT verbal, and I also identified patterns and mistakes that I rectified to obtain a good score. 

Overall, the strength of the course, the analytics offered to gauge your progress, and the live support of their strategy team, work hand-in-hand to ensure that you get to your target score.

Adaptive Sigma-X mocksI started my GMAT Prep a year back. But due to critical health conditions, I wasn’t able to give the exam back then.

July 2023: After recovering partially, I started my GMAT journey with e-gmat starting by giving an OG Mock (760) and a Sigma-X (740).

I started my prep at a point where I knew the basics but where I lacked were:
•	The identification of areas where I usually missed things (even though I knew the concepts), resulting in wrong answers
•	The test-taking strategy. 

The result: My mock scores fluctuated a lot between 710-750 on Sigma-X, although a constant 760 on all OG Mocks.

Note: Never take OG mocks as an actual representation of your GMAT performance. Questions on actual GMAT are way tougher than what you will see in OG mocks. One thing you’ll learn when you give the Sigma-X mocks – An almost equivalent representation of the actual GMAT

Akash, the Strategy expert from e-gmat, worked with me continuously to help me get constant with my strategy and scores.

Top 3 areas where e-GMAT helped me:
•	Identification of conceptual gaps
•	Identification of logical gaps while solving problems
•	Test-taking strategy

Although on my best preparation, I, on the test day, was in a tensed state of mind.
(Tip to avoid: Stick to e-gmat test day strategies before entering the testing premises and follow them later on till you finsh the exam). 

I started with Quant and saw some real challenging questions in the test, and I made the mistake of making the assumption that I somewhat missed a few questions and hence would have missed the perfect 51.
This self-doubt impacted significantly my performance in Verbal.

Thanks to e-gmat because of whose approaches I was able to do quite well on the CR and SC sections, but messed up in the RC due to lack of focus and in self-doubt. If not for the CR and SC methodologies by e-gmat, my score could have gone way worse.

Tips to test-takers:

•	Believe in yourself the most on test day
•	Do not doubt once you are finished with a section, focus on what’s in-hand now and not what can’t be changed now
•	Stick to test-day strategies by e-gmat, the most important one being - Solve few questions before going for the exam (I missed on them)

I got a 720 with Q51 (the section I assumed I messed up) and V36 (my lowest ever score on any mock – Hence trust e-gmat and trust the process), IR 8, and AWA 6

Fingers crossed (I’m gonna give another attempt within 15 days. Will be updating my progress)

Update: It's 770 now (Q51, V 45, IR 8, AWA 6)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=20#","0","0","","","","","",""

Each question highlights a key concept and helps you get a better understanding of where you stand concerning your quant skills
2. Scholaranium: An amazing tool that helps you get ""test-ready. It is truly a masterpiece for all those who want to improve your time management and overall test-taking strategy 
3. Mentorship: eGMAT is more than just an online course. It acts as an accountability partner. The mentors at eGMAT truly hand-hold you throughout your test prep and help you get a better understanding of how to prepare yourself for D-dayWould make the product better:1. Better solutions: The solutions are good. But there are quite a few questions that I believe could have a better solution set 
2. Less waiting time to post a doubt: You are given a limit on the number of questions that one can ask in a fixed time period. Sometimes, the waiting time for the limit to expire can hamper the study phaseI believe that eGMAT along with OG questions is more than enough for someone to perform well on the test. It is a one-stop solution to all your GMAT hurdles. Be it conceptual understanding or test readiness, eGMAT covers it all. The mentors at eGMAT are so approachable. They guide you at every step of the way. No matter how low you have performed on a quiz or how anxious you are about the test, the mentors know exactly how to reason with you and bring the best version of yourself. 

QUANT:

I think eGMAT is underrated for its quant. It truly deserves applause for its concept files, quant quizzes, test-taking strategies and more. The concept files are very detailed. No matter how good (or not so good) you are in quant, eGMAT will help you boost your understanding and overall performance on this section GUARANTEED (of course, provided you put in a genuine effort and get involved in the process) They have broken down the quant in such easy to understand language. To top it all, they flood you with so many high-quality practice questions that, upon completion, you get so much clarity on the topic under discussion. 

VERBAL: eGMAT lives up to its reputation. It has literally mastered this section and made an entire program that makes verbal smooth sailing for the student. It is a very comprehensive, very detailed, and highly intensive course. You cannot cut corners, You need to put in the hours. But once you do so, the rewards are waiting for you to reap. I want to specifically talk about their RC section. It is the shortest of all the three sub-sections (w.r.t hours of studying) on its platform but it is so impactful. eGMAT has videos that help the student work on his/her comprehension skills. How to read, when to pause and take notes (if you want to take notes), how to comprehend, the key traits of successful reading and more... they have you covered for everything on the RC section. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 

1. eGMAT is a well-structured program. You are first asked to take one of their mocks - SigmaX - and based on your performance a starting score is established. Then, your target score is asked for and accordingly, a road map to your studying is created. 
2. In each section and each sub-section detailed concept videos are provided. After completion of each sub-topic, you have concept questions under timed and non-trimmed conditions to solve. Once you reach the minimum threshold asked by them you move on to the next sub-topic. In doing so, the student not only gets an understanding of the concept under discussion but truly masters the skillset required to ace the topic 
3. Once you are done with the concept phase, you move to the Scholaranium platform which helps you hone your test-taking skills. This is a game-changer. It floods you with all the details of your performance - accuracy, time, strengths, weaknesses, and much more. 
4. Once you complete the threshold on the Scholaranium platform, you move on to the mock phase. Here, you are asked to take another Sigma X mock. And believe me, if you perform well on their mocks, you are sure to do well on the GMAT, period!

My final advice: For anyone who wants to understand the key concepts tested on the GMAT, who wants to improve their test-taking skills, who wants to break their score plateau or who wants to get a high score eGAMT is the answer. Try it and test it yourself.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=20#","1","0","","","December 26, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Hoozan,

I gave my GMAT 1st attempt during August'2023, scored a mere 600 (Q47,V27). I was not happy with the score. 
I took a few days break after the exam, during this period I introspected on my strengths and weaknesses, my study pattern etc. and I realized I need help for verbal section, and after some searching I decided to go with eGMAT . I liked the Personalized Study Plan (PSP) approach, the PSP helped by breaking down the entire preparation schedule with respect to my target score and current score.
I started with SC and completed the courses end to end. By the time I was done 50% of the course I could already feel improvement in understanding of the SC questions.
The approach of breaking down a question in segments was especially helpful to understand the intended meaning.
Through the concept quizzes and practice quizzes, ideas were reinforced and areas of conceptual gaps were identified and subsequently worked upon.
Then I went for the cementing quizzes and even though initially I did not achieve the target score but eventually I did by following the process.
Post completion of the Cementing quizzes I moved on to OG questions. I solved close to 80-100 questions only this time but I did detail analysis of each question of where I went right and wrong or took more time.
In November I took another shot at GMAT and time I scored 700 (Q48,V37). Verbal score improved by 10 points.
Being a working professional, I did not had enough time to cover the CR and RC sections. But I recommend fellow students to go through the master comprehension section, this will set up the base if you are weak in verbal. Also SC being a foundation section the improved ability in SC helped me decipher CR questions much faster, which in turn helped me to logically deconstruct RC passages.
Overall eGMAT module helped me to 
1. Build a solid conceptual foundation and take right approach to GMAT.
2. Schedule the daily study time with its time tracker
3. Pin point areas of strengths and weaknesses with its AI enabled dashboards

I found the cementing stage to be the most crucial step in my journey as I faltered on many cementing quizzes when completing certain sub-sections. This exposed my gaps in preparation and helped mitigate them immediately.

Quant was my weaker section, so I worked on that first and completed the entire course. After taking GMAT twice, I can confidently say the e-GMAT course covers every topic tested on the exam and if you follow the processes mentioned, scoring high will not be an issue.

I recently gave my GMAT and scored a 760. I would like to thank e-GMAT for providing the necessary support. I signed up for their course based on recommendation from my friend and didn't regret it for once. I started with a Diagnostic Mock and scored a 690(Q49, V35). My major gaps were in the Verbal section and that is something taught really well at eGMAT. The way each of the concept is explained along with the signature problem solving structure for each of SC, CR and RC, I never saw the verbal section from that lens. I really started enjoying that learning phase, and when I say that I just don't mean it from a GMAT perspective.

Even though I didn't spend a lot of time on quants, I did go through certain concepts and mainly the data sufficiency questions, which again were taught in a very structured way which helped me increase my Q49 to Q50. The ability to create practice quizzes at multiple levels: Topic Wise, Sectional, Cross-sectional, was something which really helped getting exam ready and I found the mocks quite close to what I encountered in my actual exam. So overall, the course really helped me cover the distance from 690 to 760.

Thanks,

Congratulations on your remarkable achievement of scoring 760 on the GMAT with a 7-point improvement to a V42 😊 This is your mentor Rashmi here. Your journey has been nothing short of inspiring.  

Realizing that verbal was your weaker area post your first mock, you left no stone unturned toward your success. Starting with basics – learning concepts and applications to practicing building ability through cementing, you took all the necessary steps toward your success. See how in CR, internalizing the pre-thinking approach through this structured approach helped you improve to an 87% accuracy for hard questions while reducing the overall time to 1min 48 seconds: 

 Image link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Amoghagr-Hard-Accuracy-in-CR  

It is this diligence and structured approach that helped you improve by an impressive 7-points in verbal and get to a V42.  

In quants, despite starting out at Q49, in your quest to get to a Q50, you did not leave any stone unturned and through a PACE-driven study plan, recognized and worked on your weaker areas. This strategic approach not only helped you save over 45 hours of your prep time, but also ensured that you reached a Q50 on your attempt. Refer to this image how the Scholaranium data already predicted your Q50: 

Image link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Amoghagr-Scholaranium-Data-Predicts-Q50  

I am really glad to hear your positive experience with the course and it is heartening to know that you used the practice quizzes and mocks to get exam ready. This is the beauty of a data-driven approach to GMAT preparation – it not only helps you build ability but also point out the areas of incremental improvement which will help you get to that top score on the GMAT. I am impressed that you made the most of this feature and were able to get to your target score in your first GMAT attempt itself😊 

Thank you for choosing e-GMAT and for recommending our course. Your success story is a testament to your hard work and dedication, and it motivates us to continue providing the best learning experience for our students. 

Wishing you continued success in your future endeavours!

Learning from my previous preparation stint,  I avoided the mistake of immediately diving into all the OG questions. I realized the significance of giving each question its due attention and thoroughly understanding the concepts. In my opinion, e-GMAT played a pivotal role in helping me achieve a 700 on the final test. It stands as the most effective product on the market, equipping students with the necessary tools to attain high scores. Consistently, I scored between 710 and 730 on the official mocks. The following are the key highlights I believe distinguish this course:

Course Structure: e-GMAT revamped its course structure post-2020. The modules now consist of short segments for each topic, allowing for a more comprehensive grasp through practice with 5-6 different questions per step. Instead of lengthy hour-long sessions, the course comprises multiple 10-minute videos, each followed by a 15-20-minute quiz. This course encompasses everything essential for acing the GMAT. 

Technology: The technological aspect is remarkably impressive. The scholarnium platform offers over 2000 freshly created questions. Users can opt for 10 different types of quizzes, catering to specific needs. Filters such as Medium/Hard/Easy, Answered/Unanswered/Incorrect/Bookmarked questions are available. The platform is resilient to connectivity issues, resuming quizzes seamlessly. Each question displays performance statistics, aiding in self-assessment. Several features like these contribute significantly to student preparation.

Personalized Support: Opting for the standard e-GMAT 4-month course, I sought guidance from the e-GMAT support team from day one. Fortunately, I was assigned to Dhruv, whose instrumental support facilitated my attainment of a 700. Over the past five months, I exchanged over 150 emails with Dhruv and the e-GMAT team. They provided guidance at every juncture, reviewing my quizzes and mock tests, suggesting pertinent steps, and pinpointing areas for improvement. While e-GMAT provides exceptional resources, personalized support amplifies its effectiveness. Dhruv's guidance, devoid of direct teaching of concepts, immensely improved my test-taking abilities simply by following his instructions diligently.

e-GMAT Six Sigma Mocks: The depth and analysis provided by these mocks are astounding. They are adaptive, unlike many other products, and offer high-quality questions accompanied by comprehensive analyses.

I started my GMAT journey in June and took the eGMAT course on the recommendation of a friend. It turned out to be the best thing that I could've asked for. I started off with a score of 630 in my mocks and found myself lacking in both concept and process skills. Through the coursework, I was able to understand the gaps in my understanding in Verbal seeing as my quant had always been a strong point. Majorly, I'd like to point out a couple of things that any aspirant should look at while picking a platform for their GMAT prep. They are as follows:

1. Content - I went through multiple guides of different companies and I found the eGMAT coursework to be very meticulous and exactly what I needed. I would point out that it is very process oriented and it really takes a lot of time to go through the coursework, however it is equally rewarding. 

2. Question bank and mocks - I don't think I've found a platform to the level of eGMAT. Their mocks and questions are very close to what official questions look like. Apart from this, their analytics blow other platforms out of the water. The precision with which I can see my strengths and weaknesses through their data analysis is unmatched and exactly something that I was looking for. I would even go to the extent to recommend using their platform solely for their mocks and question bank, if nothing else.  

3. Support - I am a person that requires constant pushing and direction when pursuing a goal such as this. I would've sent over 200 mails to support@egmat over the course of my preparation and never had to wait for longer than 4-6 hours for a response. As a student, this kind of support was essential to me doing well in my preparations. 

I'd like to thank a few people in particular on the platform namely Harshavardhan R, Abhishek Raj, and Rida for being a constant support throughout my journey. I would not have been able to pull off my score if it were not for them. They truly made the difference for me.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=22#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hey Everyone!
I recently took the GMAT test and scored a 730 (QA50, VA39). I had given my previous attempt a month ago, where I landed a 620 on the test. I improved my score by a whopping 110 points in one month. I would like to share my experience briefly about my GMAT journey.
I gave my first E-gmat Sigma X Mock and scored a 590. That's when I recognized the extent of enhancements required in my study approach, prompting me to enroll in the e-gmat course. Needless to say, the interface of the e-gmat dashboard is impeccable. The division of Quant and Verbal into various subtopics provides a student with the precise and accurate topic-wise breakdown of the syllabus, really helping to understand the weak and strong areas. The P.A.C.E feature helped me save a lot of time in my preparation.
I meticulously went through each module, ensuring completion of every practice quiz question and application question to enhance my skills. After each section, I took the Cementing quizzes, which really helped me gain confidence. I not only built my skills but also ensured that my understanding of the topics is crystal clear.
The next phase of my preparation involved multiple quizzes (Topic-wise Quiz, Mixed quiz, etc.) of varying lengths. The quiz structure was provided to me by my mentor, Abha. The quizzes contained medium to hard-level questions, and my aim was to achieve around 70-80% accuracy in them. Initially, I found the quizzes to be challenging, but towards the end of my preparation, I realized that these quizzes are helping me further in the preparation. Following several quizzes, I developed effective time management skills, achieving greater accuracy by discerning which questions to skip and which ones to attempt. I largely focused on accuracy in these quizzes as I was already done with the concept part.
Next came the Mock ramp-up phase when I started giving Sigma X mocks. In those mocks, I scored between 650-700. One notable aspect of the Sigma X mocks is their comprehensive analysis of errors by topic, coupled with a progression analysis. These mocks helped me identify specific areas where I was struggling and provided guidance on how to enhance my performance. The mock structure closely mirrored that of the actual GMAT exam.
When I first wrote the exam, I scored a 620 (VA27, QA48). To be honest, I was quite surprised because I was crystal clear in the concepts and had made sure to cover each and every aspect thoroughly. I decided not to give up and gave myself another month before going for the exam again. Finally, after one month of hard work, I booked the exam date and gave my best foot forward. Once I hit the submit button and saw the score, I was overwhelmed with joy and tears of happiness. After a dismal 620 in the previous attempt, I had scored a 730!
I’m really grateful to E-gmat for providing me with an excellent mentor. Abha helped me throughout the journey by constantly pushing me and motivating me to do better. I would request her for ad-hoc calls, and she would always be available for me. The combinations of the quizzes provided by her really helped me to get to my current score. Overall, the course is extensive and totally worth every penny. I would definitely recommend the same to test-takers.
Thank you!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=22#","0","0","","","","","",""

Video lessons included everything you need to know
Very accurate, adaptive mocks, that are extremely similar to the actual exam.Would make the product better:One small feature I would change is that you can't fast forward the videos in the verbal section. I would've sped up my study greatly if I could've watched the videos at 1.5x or 2x speed.I started my journey hovering around a 630 score. With the help of Akash, and diligent work on my part, following the video lessons structure for both verbal and quant, and later following a personalised mock study plan, I was able to chip away slowly at my deficiencies and reach my target score.

The video lessons were extremely clear and holistic. They included everything tested on the GMAT, not just in terms of the foundational concepts, but also in how to apply said concepts in ways tested in the GMAT. 

The area I most struggled with was Sentence correction, but with a huge array of official, and non-official practice questions, I was able to work at specifically targeting my weaknesses.

When moving on to the test readiness stage, in my last few weeks, I was given a personalised study plan, and a combination of e-GMAT mocks and official ones. This last stage was essential for my learning.

I wholeheartedly recommend e-gmat to anyone aspiring to take the GMAT, regardless of what stage you are in your learning. With personalised help, and hard work from your part, e-GMAT will help you achieve your target score.

2.) Vast question bank - especially Quant 
3.) Perfect combination of self-paced study structure and mentorship (Dhruv was my mentor, and he is absolutely and totally a pillar of strength for aspirants and e-GMAT). 
4.) Dhruv, and e-GMAT platform gave me thorough and correct feedback on where I went wrong, and how to improve in each aspect which helped me manage my time most productively by working harder on my weaker areas, and revising my stronger areas. This is a boon for anyone who also has other time-taking commitments such as work and/or studies.  
5.) Balancing a hectic work life and high GMAT score aspiration, I had to take off days in between preparation due to work/other reasons, but the quizzes and revision and summary modules helped me get back on track. My mentor would also check-in with me and remind me to go over things at intervals of 2-3 days for 30 minutes or so, to keep the momentum going which helped me stay on track.Would make the product better:1.) I think Verbal modules could be a bit better, as well as the Verbal questions since I did not find them a very accurate representation of the actual GMAT questions half the time, especially RC passages.e-GMAT was instrumental in helping me achieve my target score of 750+. I found their platform and their pedagogy intuitive to follow, easy to use, and suitable to my schedule and aspiration. The course content was comprehensive and covered each topic that is tested on the GMAT. I particularly found Quant very detailed, and went through each module to revise and apply concepts. While I had a good grasp of the concepts tested by GMAT makers prior to taking the e-GMAT course, I struggled a bit in time management which made me a little haphazard in answering the questions, leading to silly mistakes and rushed problem-solving. 
e-GMAT helped me build upon my ability to hone my exam-taking strategy -  which is crucial to getting to the 99th percentile. Approaches such as the Meaning-based approach in SC, Pre-thinking in CR, note-taking in RC and the 7-skills for Quant increased my accuracy and made my timing strategy very strong. The platform is very interactive, and combined with their advanced, adaptive quizzing platform Scholaranium helped me evaluate myself at every step of the way, which is again crucial for scoring well in GMAT. 
I especially really liked the cementing quizzes, ability quizzes and conceptual quizzes which helped me simulate exam-like testing environments for Quant and Verbal sections. I also found the entire team very supportive, understanding of my schedule, and quick to respond. My mentor Dhruv Joshi was one of the most key players in my journey and I cannot thank him enough:) He would regularly check-in with me, respond to all my questions - his guidance and encouragement was invaluable. I had to take off days irregularly in between due to sudden professional commitments, and Dhruv really helped me here by checking in with me every 2-3 days and reminding me to go over my notes for even 30 minutes to keep the momentum going. A big challenge for me was accommodating GMAT prep along with my professional and other commitments and e-GMAT was invaluable in their support and guidance in helping me achieve my target score alongside. 
I would 100% recommend GMAT test-takers to check out e-GMAT once before committing to test preparation. Further, I would also suggest that future GMAT test-takers go over the official guidelines about each of the sections very carefully and gain a thorough understanding of the structure of the exam. Going in with a thorough knowledge about what the exam asks for, along with a strong plan-of-action that takes into account one’s current ability and accommodates their schedule will lead to the best results. I would also ask potential test-takers to be patient with the process, not get dejected by small obstacles or failures, preserve and be consistent in your efforts and work with single-minded focus on your goals and you will surely do well.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=22#","0","0","","","November 08, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi pv09 

Congratulations on the fantastic score!   

What a journey you’ve had!! 

Your success is a testament to how important being self-aware during prep is. You introspected after your first attempt of 730 (Q49, V40) and realized that to go from a high score to a higher GMAT score needed much more than what you had been offering. 

If someone looks at your Verbal Scholaranium scores today, no one will believe that Verbal was once your weakness. You turned this weakness into your strength with your patience- the patience to UNLEARN and then LEARN a more methodical approach to SC, CR, and RC. You took your Verbal abilities a notch higher by applying this structured approach 

Take a glance at your Verbal Stats: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/pv09-Verbal-Scholaranium-stats 

Diligence and the right decisions during prep played a key role in helping you improve from V39 (88th Percentile in your 1st attempt) to V44 (96th Percentile in your 2nd attempt). Your most significant improvement was seen in CR. You improved your accuracy while simultaneously reducing the time to answer questions by applying the Pre-thinking process. 

https://success.e-gmat.com/pv09-CR-Improvement 

Your SIGma-X mock attempts gave the much-needed predictability, Your scores of Q49 on 2 mocks followed by 2 consecutive Q50 scores gave you the much-needed confidence to go out there and ace the Quant section 

https://success.e-gmat.com/pv09-Quantscore-Prediction 

When I look back at your journey, I can surely say that it had its own set of challenges. However, the way you rose above every challenge makes your achievement even more special.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The e-GMAT course offers a very structured and process oriented approach to the Verbal section,which generally troubles the non-native speakers the most. This is probably the most significant differentiator of the course. The course focuses immensely on the process of solving  rather than merely solving the question correct. I believe this focus on correct process and structured approach to questions is a must for a great score .I did not start my Gmat journey with e-GMAT. I started with two other Gmat prep courses, one after the other, which are also available on GMAT club. I did work as diligently as I did in the e-GMAT course, sticking to  'AI  curated plan', taking live classes and following every step instructed by the experts.
 I did not have a process to address different types of question that Gmat offers. I ended up just mugging up lots of grammar rules, skimming through passages, and following all  sorts of shortcuts and gimmicks. With confused efforts the results were also confusing,  Gmat mock scores ranging from 650 to 750 in 10+ mocks. The scores were very inconsistent. However, I went on with my First Gmat attempt and scored a 650(Q50,V27). 

Disappointed with my official score and not knowing what to do next, I attended the e-Gmat free session and then  I realised that I neither had a process nor a focus on key aspects such as author's intended meaning in SC, his line of reasoning in CR or the intention behind an RC passage. Thus, after the free session ,I joined the e-GMAT course. 

As I completely followed the e-Gmat course, the most difficult part was not to learn the new process oriented approach but to get rid of the gimmicks and solving techniques that I had learned earlier. I followed the course plan sincerely and thus my accuracies improved in all the verbal  sub-sections. As I put in diligent efforts, so I got into the Last Mile Program and I got a dedicated mentor.
 
I am very thankful to Rida mam for guiding me through the whole process, for attending to different weak areas one by one and most importantly for hearing out all my woes and cries with verbal for so long. 

Since then ,my GMAT scores have only gone up. I recently scored a V42 on the official Gmat,which is yet to be officially reported. I doubt that this jump from V27 were possible without the constant help and mentorship from Rida mam. The Last Mile program is really one of its kind and really helped me focus on the key aspects. This includes understanding at a granular level what my strengths and weaknesses are and helping me to build the right strategy to work on them.

I now have a structured process to solve the verbal section, a process that focuses on understanding the author and realising the true intent of a passage  rather than on merely solving. It is now that I realise the beauty of this test, and what skills it focuses on. This realisation took quite a long  time as I wasted a lot of precious time on gimmicks and shortcuts suggested by other prep companies in my earlier phases of Gmat Prep.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=23#","0","0","","","","","",""

The first step comprises learning concepts in the form of very well-defined and interesting video lectures, notes, and quizzes. The course also has functionality, which by using various quizzes helped me to understand my current strengths and weaknesses in a topic, and accordingly, it suggests the topics I could skip and topics I should cover in order to bridge the gaps in the least amount of time. In this stage, I was able to understand each concept thoroughly and build a solid foundation required for acing GMAT.

In the Cementing phase, the course allowed me to apply those learned concepts in more GMAT like questions in a timely manner, building my problem-solving skills, enhancing my speed, and improving accuracy in both Quant and Verbal sections.

In the test readiness stage, I used the course's data analytics tool to understand the areas where I was weak and more focus was required, and I used custom Scholaranium quizzes to improve my ability in those areas. The mocks included in this course are computer adaptive tests and follow algorithms very similar to the those of official GMAT exam. Egmat Mocks are very accurate predictors of actual GMAT score and provide in-depth data analysis which is very similar to ESR.

While learning a new skill we are bound to make errors but the key to ace GMAT is to learn from our errors and do not repeat them. For this process, EGMAT suggests the use of error logs and provides very good templates to maintain error logs. Maintaining and revising error logs made me understand the mistakes in my approach and the wrong patterns that I was unconsciously repeating.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=23#","0","0","","","November 08, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Av919

e-GMAT mock tests are reliable.
The questions featured in Scholaranium match the standards set by official questions.Would make the product better:I recommend implementing a feature that allows users to increase the playback speed of videos in the core e-GMAT modules.I took my first GMAT attempt on December 5th, 2022, just before the round 2 deadlines. Initially, my preparation solely relied on studying a grammar module I found online. Unfortunately, my results, especially in the verbal section, fell short of my target score. Recognizing my lack of strategy, I understood the need for a more comprehensive approach.

After extensive research, I chose e-GMAT as my preferred prep solution, and it proved to be an excellent decision. The most valuable aspect of e-GMAT for me was its structured problem-solving process. The meaning-based approach for Sentence Correction (SC) and the pre-thinking step for Critical Reasoning (CR) were precisely what I needed. I thoroughly covered both the SC and CR sections. The content was well-structured, breaking down complex concepts into manageable, smaller parts.

In addition to the theory, the Verbal Scholaranium section offered a wealth of questions comparable in quality to official ones. Keeping error logs and attempting both cementing and custom quizzes added significant value to my preparation. Thanks to thoroughly covering the e-GMAT verbal section, I achieved a remarkable 10-point improvement in my verbal scaled score, rising from 31 to 41. I highly recommend e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=23#","0","0","","","","","",""

Sigma-X mocksWould make the product better:Response times to emails
Adding AWA and IR to mocksHey everyone! I recently took the GMAT and scored a 700, which is a 10-point improvement from my previous score of 690. I scored 690 two times before joining e-gmat. Before going through with e-gmat, I went through many reviews posted on Gmat Club and found e-gmat would be a good platform for me to improve my verbal score. I first had my ESR analyzed by Dhruv Joshi, who was also my mentor for the preparation journey. He curated a plan to make sure I solidified my verbal skills. 

The E-gmat course was very structured, having modules for each topic. One thing that stood out to me was the content. Everything was covered properly, and their meaning-based approach to every question helped me a lot. I was struggling in CR before, but the pre-thinking framework that is taught in e-gmat helped me with CR tremendously. Their cementing quizzes made sure that I solidified my learning. 

Their quant course content is also really good. And the Sigma-X mocks closely mimic the real GMAT. I would suggest they add the AWA and IR sections as well to the mocks. Also, it would be better if the response times to emails by the support team were a bit faster.

My mentor, Dhruv Joshi, has been very helpful to me in this journey, as he guided me in the best way possible. 

Overall, I was happy with the course and recommend others also to give it a try.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=23#","0","0","","","January 03, 2024","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi SandeepReddy26

2. Should think about offering the basic mentorship program at a much cheaper cost so that all students can benefitI’m really grateful to e-GMAT for helping me through this journey. I’m a working professional in the finance industry with limited availability of free time, especially on weekdays. I was looking for a solution that helps me stick to my preparation timeline and provides me with a structured course to follow without me having to spend time figuring out what I need to study next. e-GMAT met my objectives perfectly. I had a mentor assigned by e-GMAT, Akash Aggarwal, who constantly pushed me to commit a certain number of hours per week for the GMAT prep. Also, the course structure of e-GMAT is so easy to follow. You just need to trust the process. 

To be honest, my GMAT prep journey was anything but smooth. In all, my prep time was about 9 months. It included 3 months of no prep due to work commitments. Frankly, it was frustrating at times given the impact of these uncontrollable events on my prep timeline. However, the regular check-ins with Akash and his guidance really helped me push through this journey. I did give an attempt after my 8 months of prep. However, due to the final day exam anxiety, I panicked in the verbal section and, as a result, I had to cancel my score. I was really disappointed and was probably thinking about not giving another attempt. However, Akash made me realize that I was test ready and that I had to just work on my mindset for the final day. Thus, I prepped for one more month and gave another attempt, in which I was much more under control and ended up doing well. 

For me, e-GMAT played the following three important roles in my journey:
1. Provided a highly structured course
2. Assigned me Akash as my mentor (I highly recommend him in case you end up opting for the e-GMAT’s mentorship program!!!)
3. Offered an excellent preparation module for the verbal section (was really important to me given I’m a non-native English speaker)

If you’re thinking about giving GMAT and are in the similar boat I was (working professional, limited time availability, non-native speaker), I highly recommend subscribing to e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=23#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I recently embarked on the challenging journey of preparing for the GMAT, and I couldn't be happier with my decision to enroll in the e-GMAT's Online 360 course. This comprehensive program was nothing short of a game-changer for me, helping me boost my GMAT score by a whopping 100 points, ultimately achieving a score of 730.

Here are some key aspects of the e-GMAT course that I found particularly impressive:

e-GMAT follows a three-step process, which comprises Concept Files, Cementing, and Test Readiness. The first step comprises learning concepts in the form of very well-defined and interesting video lectures, notes, and quizzes. The course also has functionality, which by using various quizzes helped me to understand my current strengths and weaknesses in a topic, and accordingly, it suggests the topics I could skip and topics I should cover in order to bridge the gaps in the least amount of time. In this stage, I was able to understand each concept thoroughly and build a solid foundation required for acing GMAT.

In the Cementing phase, the course allowed me to apply those learned concepts in more GMAT like questions in a timely manner, building my problem-solving skills, enhancing my speed, and improving accuracy in both Quant and Verbal sections.

In the test readiness stage, I used the course's data analytics tool to understand the areas where I was weak and more focus was required, and I used custom Scholaranium quizzes to improve my ability in those areas. The mocks included in this course are computer adaptive tests and follow algorithms very similar to the those of official GMAT exam. Egmat Mocks are very accurate predictors of actual GMAT score and provide in-depth data analysis which is very similar to ESR. 

While learning a new skill we are bound to make errors but the key to ace GMAT is to learn from our errors and do not repeat them. For this process, EGMAT suggests the use of error logs and provides very good templates to maintain error logs. Maintaining and revising error logs made me understand the mistakes in my approach and the wrong patterns that I was unconsciously repeating.

Moreover, The last mile program offered by EGMAT is a cherry on top of this excellent course. Through the LMP program, I received guidance and support from Dhruv, my dedicated mentor. I am incredibly grateful for the unwavering support and guidance that Dhruv provided throughout my preparation journey. He motivated and inspired me, even during the most challenging moments of my GMAT preparation. He instilled in me a sense of confidence and determination, reminding me that I had the potential to excel in the GMAT.

In conclusion, e-GMAT has proven to be a game-changer in my GMAT preparation journey. With its exceptional instructors, comprehensive curriculum, personalized support, and results-driven approach, I was able to achieve my target score. If you're serious about excelling in the GMAT, I wholeheartedly recommend e-GMAT as your go-to partner. It's an investment in your future that pays off in dividends.

It began with a mock to get my current status, then as per my estimated required score, it helped me plan a schedule which could work together with my day job.
The ordering of the course and the emphasis on fundamentals helped me a lot as I often ignored minor mistakes as flukes or speeding errors. Using ""strategic pausing"" and ""pre-thinking"" drastically changed the way how I was attempting questions in Verbal and also allowed me to score well.
Another aspect that I liked about e-GMAT is the Cementing Quizzes. Even when we complete the study material, it is difficult to be confident about it & we often doubt if we can perform well in the actual situation. Cementing quizzes and Yes/No loops were very helpful for that since I had to take a break from studying in between and I wasn't sure about the material that I covered previously. After the quizzes, I could identify my weak points and focus on improving them, which saved me a lot of time.

Many practice questions with excellent explanations.
Amazing learning modules of the concepts.Would make the product better:More clarity on how to make the most of the custom quizzes and all of the practice questions.Hello all! Last week I took the GMAT for the second time and managed to score 760 (V44, Q49), up from 710 in my previous attempt. For my preparation, I mainly relied on E-GMAT. I would like to share what this preparation looked like.
I started my GMAT journey back in March 2023. I approached my preparation with no rush as I was not clear, and still am not clear, when I would be applying to an MBA program. I recently graduated from college and simply wanted to “get the GMAT out of the way” and make use of the 5-year window it has. Another relevant piece of information of my preparation is that I was working full-time throughout my preparation, so time was an issue. 
When I started choosing a GMAT preparation course, I had a preconceived notion that the most important thing for preparation was practice. I also needed a course that I could take at my own rhythm due to my lack of time. Because E-GMAT had the most practice questions among the courses I was considering and because of its flexibility, I enrolled to E-GMAT. 
Coming into the preparation, my weakest part was verbal, specifically sentence correction. When I started the course, I realized that practice alone was not enough and that there were several conceptual gaps I had to attack first. E-GMAT’s structured course was perfect to attack these gaps. All of the modules were very helpful. 
Even though making sure all the conceptual knowledge is clear was essential, the practice that came afterward was as well. I took my first attempt of the GMAT when I had not gone through enough practice, and hence, did not get my target score. After that, my focus was primarily in practicing. For this, the E-GMAT platform is perfect. Being able to create custom quizzes tailored to once needs was super helpful. Although the amount of option for these quizzes might be a bit overwhelming at first.
Lastly, a key part of the preparation was the actions taken after taking any practice quiz, which are extensively recommended by E-GMAT. This key part was making sure I truly understood the answer of every single practice question I took, even if I got them right. 
In short, the E-GMAT course manages to tackle all of the key needs of a successful GMAT preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=24#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I have divided my review into the following segments:

1. Course Structure
The structure of the content has been designed very well. Across both Quant and Verbal, there were ability quizzes along with cementing quizzes that helped identify the preparation level and provided detailed information about the key areas of mistakes and timing issues. The question pool is great with options to select the type of questions (Correct, Incorrect etc). Moreover, the mode of quizzes and video solutions helped enhanced the overall learning experience.
2. Content – Verbal
Sentence Correction – The meaning-based approach was quite helpful. I was able to apply the relevant concepts and use the three-step process across most of the questions that enhanced my SC score in the exams. 
CR – The Pre-thinking approach is quite effective. After struggling with CR in the initial stages, I began to apply pre-thinking approach more consciously that improved my accuracy. The approach helped me eliminate the irrelevant answer choices and evaluate the correct choices in a better way.
RC – The passages in the quizzes and mocks were of a good level and provided effective practice for the real exam.

3. Content – Quant
For Quants, the quizzes were most helpful. The type of questions are relatively difficult compared to the real exam but it helped me prepare well for the exam and improved my timing. Taking a good amount of quizzes across all the topics helped me identify the key strength and weakness.

4. Mocks
The Sigma X mocks are a good indicator of the actual performance of the exam. The mocks provide ESR analysis along with detailed solutions and timing distribution that helped me understand my improvement areas. I was able to focus on specific topics of CR and SC through the mock analysis provided. 

5. Last Mile Push (LMP) Program
After I had completed my preparation and began with the final lap of my preparation, I had reached out to E-GMAT team for certain improvement strategies. Rashmi from E-GMAT team contacted me and we started with the LMP program. Since I was struggling with time in mocks and faced difficulty in certain areas of Verbal, she helped me identify where I was going wrong and provided detailed study plan to be followed. She was very proactive in taking a regular progress check and gave effective suggestions such as practicing LSAT passages for RC and following strict timing rules for every block of questions in the verbal section. Additionally, the importance of letting go of questions that I was unsure of and keeping a positive mindset helped me on the D-day. The program was one of the best part of my preparation phase as it gave me a structured schedule and distributed my study plan uniformly through all sections.
In my opinion, LMP is a great program to enroll for improving test-taking strategies and streamlining the preparation plan.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=24#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

In my case, quant was a significant challenge, and e-GMAT's tailored approach and in-depth content provided a laser-focused strategy to bolster my quant skills, allowing me to polish all the concepts I thought I had but as it turned out I didn't!

Having a strategy expert was key. Rida's expertise and guidance were instrumental in demystifying the study process. The structured course (considering both CONCEPT and PROCESS skills), with its interactive modules, practice quizzes, and detailed analytics, enabled me to track my progress and see real improvement.

While I overinvested a lot on my GMAT prep overall before e-GMAT (too much, really), the program ultimately gave me the edge to obtain my ""minimum, great"" score. 

Please now that on my mocks (both e-GMAT's and OG's) I was scoring 760-790, so the course will give everything you need to succeed. I underdelivered come test day due to nerves + time management, but that's alright!

It is a highly structured course and is ideal for someone looking to ace the test with minimum effort in trying to figure out how to do it. Verbal videos and explanations are top-notch, and verbal scholaranium is amazing for doing self-paced learning.Would make the product better:Maybe introduce P.A.C.E. like structure for verbal as well! There were quite a few modules that I found to be a bit repetitive. Also, there should be an option to speed up the videos as it takes up a lot of time and is extremely slow.I absolutely loved the second leg of my GMAT Journey, which I prepared for using e-GMAT. I was able to develop a solid verbal ability, even though it didn't reflect that much in my test scores; however, it's a skill I can apply in my everyday life. I believe that if you have an e-GMAT subscription, you don't need any other material to prepare, as it truly is a complete product.

Course Material:
Coming from an Indian engineering background, I knew I wouldn't face a problem with Quant, and I was short on time. So, I decided to focus all my energy on Verbal to maximize my score in the shortest time possible. The Verbal course material was divided into the three main sections - RC, CR, and SC - and each section had multiple videos and practice files. I found the course material to be exceptional because the videos covered all the concepts in thorough detail and avoided giving generic shortcuts that fail during difficult questions. Learning these concepts helped me face any question. The small practice modules in between the videos were indeed useful and helped reinforce the concepts. Lastly, the practice files allowed me to test the concepts learned in each module.
I do not have much feedback on quant as I didn't prepare quant from e gmat, but I have heard great feedback on quant as well! 

Scholaranium:
In my opinion, Scholaranium is the best e-learning product I've come across. Firstly, it offers a large question bank with more questions being added after finishing a mock test. Secondly, the option of creating custom quizzes and completing them in a time-bound manner is really helpful, and I would recommend everyone to attempt all questions in Scholaranium in a time-bound manner to simulate the real GMAT experience. The quality of solutions provided for each question is top-notch and clears even the silliest doubts you can have. Moreover, you can view the time spent on each question and modify your strategy accordingly. I spent a large proportion of my time here strengthening my concepts.
I recommend everyone to not think that GMAT quant is easier that e GMAT quant, as I am pretty sure that is not true having gone through the actual test multiple times. 

Mentorship:
Dhruv from e-GMAT helped me assess my e-GMAT mocks and gave me a clear picture of where I was lacking, pointing out things that I was unintentionally overlooking.

Scholaranium
Strategy and MentorshipWould make the product better:Quant Lessons
Option to schedule 1 or 2 ,1-1 with Instructor/expertsI decided to go with e-gmat course based on the GMAT forum reviews and my experience using the free trial . I’ve studied using the e-gmat online course for almost 16 months and hence this review will be as detailed as possible outlining the advantages , mistakes to avoid, and how to effectively use this course.

I started with a free consultation call with e-gmat to understand how to use this course and to get a study plan. I like how the mentor was detailed in his approach and was focused on explaining , not selling. I took a free trial and was impressed with the platform UI and resources available.

Platform review : The UI is extremely easy to use with a good structure to it . The split of Verbal and Quant, further sub section splits, study planner, scholaranium with both e-gmat and OG question bank in one place, bookmark and notes section, accuracy metrics etc - each of these things were really helpful for me in planning my time, revising concepts and improving on weak topics .
I’ve used Study planner every day to input the hours I was putting in and the planner accordingly adjusts the expected time of course completion .
I would bookmark the questions which I wanted to review once and would use the notes tab to input my though process, improvement areas and approach issues . The questions where you’ve put notes will move to separate tab which can be used for your final review list in last days.

Course Content Review: 
Verbal :
SC - The meaning based approach is the only way to ace 700+ level questions . The questions in the official exam move away from basic grammatical errors as you level up , and even if there are some grammatical errors it would be very difficult to identify them. I was extremely weak in SC initially, getting only 50-60% accuracy even in medium questions , but with lot of effort , cementing the process, following the e-gmat approach - my accuracy went to 80% in Hard questions . 
The process to solve a question is extremely standardised, if you do the Course (practice files and application files ) as suggested it will become second nature .

CR - The Prethinking framework is useful for Medium level questions. I personally, wasn’t able to benefit much from it in Hard level .  But what would help definitely is the framework , the mapping and visualisation habit of premise and understanding of the question statement . 
The framework to make a falsification scenario, the swing test for evaluate questions, the table mapping in boldface questions were extremely useful. 

RC - I am not an avid reader and I would average 6-7 mins reading time in long passages initially . With some of the concept files like Master Comprehension and Keyword importance taught by Harsha I was able to achieve high accuracy in RC and reduce time to 4-5 mins. 

Quant : If you’re aiming for 48+ in Quant , there is very little chance to do it with just OG questions . I was consistently getting Q50-51 in official mocks and almost 90% accuracy in OG questions , but the official GMAT test was far from them .
The e-gmat course is extremely detailed, the foundation and approach is strengthened in the course and then by practicing Hard e-gmat questions from Scholaranium I was able to achieve Q49 . Probably , would’ve managed a Q50 if I didn’t get 4 Set theory questions :/

Strategy and Mentorship :
Dhruv Joshi, e-gmat mentor, has been instrumental in motivating me, providing study plan and helping me achieve 730 . He was a constant help and support for a period of 1.5 years . I would often have good accuracy but troubled time management. This is where Dhruv helped me understand how skill is function of both time and accuracy , in identifying timing issues, reducing TAKT time, and employing skipping strategy where required . He was able to provide me realistic and effective study plans based on my improvement areas and availability. 

Few Important tips :
Do not break the structure of the course -  Trust the process and, accuracy and timing will get better with time . A big reason I was having inconsistent accuracy , extreme anxiety and low scores in my first attempt was me not following the exact structure . 

Use mocks when required - E-gmat gives 5 mocks, which Imo are bit less . The quality of these mocks is at par with official exam , hence plan these mocks when there is a notable improvement in preparation. Use custom quizzes to improve the Test readiness , which can replace need of mocks to some extent .

Be in touch with mentor : Be in constant touch of your assigned mentor. Even a chit chat on prep issues, exam anxiety, day to day tips from mentor can act as a stress reliever .


Small platform suggestion for e-gmat : I would solve, say, 100 questions total in SC, and when I would take a custom 20 question quiz of attempted questions some of the questions would come multiple times and some not that often . So if there is a counter at backend to count the number of times a question has come in quiz , it will make sure the questions appear uniformly . This will make sure during revisions we see all questions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=24#","0","0","","","October 06, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi amankvaish

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Signature Meaning Based Approach - e-Gmat doesn't teach shortcuts but focusses on the meaning and building blocks of every topic in quants and verbal. A student just needs to follow the process diligently and you can easily score 700+.

Quality & Quantity of questions - The question quality is so great that every question teaches a student something new. Also there are several 100s of questions - one will never run out of new questions in any area.

The best verbal SMEs - Amazing mentors. They are so good at the subject that even if you are not very good at any topic, they will ensure that you easily understand each and every aspect of the subject.Would make the product better:Just one suggestion . In cementing (application quizzes), eGmat can add a few easy cementing quizzes to start with. The problem with starting directly with medium difficulty questions is that if a student doesn't do well, it's very easy to get demotivated. So may be a few warm up easy questions in a timed environment to begin with will help.Why e-Gmat – I was not very good at verbal and I happened to come across the e-Gmat YouTube channel which has a lot of free content. I was very impressed, both with the quality of teaching as well as the quality of questions and I immediately decided to enroll with E Gmat.

Course Quality – The E Gmat course starts from ground zero and teaches you the most basic stuff. So even if you are not in touch with verbal/ quants for years, it becomes very easy to follow the course. It even has a master comprehension course which teaches you how to read a sentence with strategic pauses. The questions are graded in such a manner that the difficulty level increases as you complete each module.

Consistent Approach – Hands down, EGMAT is the best when it comes to the approach – be it in SC, CR or RC. It does not teach you shortcuts which often cannot be replicated across questions, but focuses on a meaning-based approach that teaches you the nuances of the topic which will help you to solve any question irrespective of the difficulty level.

Cementing Quizzes – These are application quizzes and there are several hundreds of questions that one can never complete all of them. The best part here is that the course tells you how many quizzes you need to attempt for each difficulty level and the minimum score that you need to get in these quizzes before you can proceed to the next module. 
Such practice ensures that a student gets enough practice before he moves on to the next question.

Advance Algorithms – You can drill down on your performance in any area with e-Gmat’s user friendly and advanced dashboards and you get to know the exact sub areas where you are performing well and the areas where you need to go back and revise.

Support from Strategy Experts – I first wrote to the EGmat expert team on March 27, 2023 and I wrote my Gmat on Sept 20, 2023. During this period, there were so many emails exchanged between me and one of the e-Gmat Strategy experts, Akash Aggarwal. He guided me in every step and I can’t thank him enough for my GMAT score. 

The best Verbal Mentor Payal Tandon – When I started my GMAT preparation, I found it difficult to even identify verbs in a sentence. Payal is so outstanding in her explanations that one thing I will miss post my exam now is listening to her videos. I attended a lot of her recorded seminars as well and she would often tell her students to ask themselves a simple question while trying to solve the question - Does this make sense. Now every time, I read a question – Payal’s voice would echo in my ears and I ask myself a lot of probe questions while trying to arrive at the answer.

Note – My review above is mostly on verbal as I had a strong base in quants. But needless to say, even the quants course of e-Gmat is outstanding.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=24#","0","0","","","October 10, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear ParikshitSaikia,

Congratulations on your score of 730 with a remarkable V41! A 90-point improvement overall is a phenomenal achievement and everyone here at e-GMAT is so happy to have been a part of your journey.

Scoring a V41 in Verbal is not an easy feat to achieve. It is possible only when you showcase consistency and dedication throughout your journey. You’ve discussed a great strategy for tackling RC passages where you are not acquainted with the topics of the passages. Through these strategies, your statistics across three subsections in Verbal in hard questions as shown in the below image, predict your amazing verbal score.

We appreciate your feedback, but the purpose behind no easy cementing quizzes is that the student will already go through a lot of practice quizzes in the modules which consist of easy and medium questions. This practice leads to a strong foundation of basics. 

With your zeal, you managed to achieve excellence in the GMAT exam. I am sure that you will face every challenge thrown at you with the utmost determination and I wish you all the very best for your next steps!

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1) Course outline and organisation into skill blocks
2) Data driven analytical approach to your test data
3) Cementing quizzes and error logWould make the product better:Maybe the course should mention somewhere that the Quant section is harder than the actual exam. I stuck through with Quant till the end but knowing this beforehand would have definitely made it easier! 

I'd also recommend to improve the quality of the CR questions and use OG questions where possible as they are the most well made. 

Lastly, it is probably too much to ask but maybe the Verbal section can have two approaches. The existing one for non-native speakers and a solving-by-your-ear type approach for those more well versed in English (in this area gmat ninja's answers on the SC questions on the GC forum are invaluable).I initially gave the GMAT in 2016 when I graduated and scored a 680. I do not have the sectional scores but the verbal was around V40 and the math score was poor. For several reasons, I decided to retake the GMAT 7 years later and apply to the top MBA programs. 

My case is unique in that I struggled with Quant section rather than the Verbal. I had a couple of bad maths teachers in high school, hated maths in O levels and never gave it in A Levels either. 

I decided to firstly fix my foundation in Math. I chose the EGMAT because: 

1) There are too many resources out there and it is not possible as a working professional to design your own study materials based on everything available out there for free. 
2) I heard good reviews about EGMAT and especially that the Quant section was great. 

I started off the course in February 2023 and decided to not settle an exam data beforehand and just see where the course takes me. 

I would highly recommend EGMAT for several reasons: 

1) The course is comprehensive for both Quant and Verbal. Every section starts off with a diagnostic that judges your ability in that area (for e.g. number properties > Even/Odd Numbers). Based on how well you perform on the diagnostic, the EGMAT algo skips certain lessons and tells you to do some other ones. This saves time. 

2) The course is well organised in blocks of skills that you need. This gives you confidence. 

3) Rather than approach the test from the mindset of ""lets find you quick tricks to figure out complex problems"", the course makes you do the proper math behind every problem. This was excruciatingly painful and time confusing for me but it was also extremely useful. a) It gives you confidence in your ability > less nerves on the actual test b) if you come across a very unique question, you have a solid foundation to fall back on. 

4) The analytics for me were one of the two best parts of the course. Every question you solve gives you data: your accuracy in certain skill blocks, how quickly you answered the question and how quickly others have done on similar problems. This insight is very useful as it keeps timing in the back of your head from the very start. 

5) The second best part of the course for me was the Cementing Quizzes. These quizzes are blocks of 10 questions that test your ability on a particular topic. EGMAT says that if you get 70% accuracy on the ""Medium"" and 50% accuracy on the ""Hard"" quizzes, you should be at 70th percentile. I was sceptical of this at first but it was very accurate for me. I consistently scored Q48-49 on practice mocks and scored Q48 on the actual test. 

Moving on to the verbal section, the critical reasoning section was the best for me. The pre-thinking concept is a game changer when solving CR questions. These questions can get very tricky at the higher levels and pre-thinking can help you really ace those questions. The instruction is clear and concise and the course is neither too short nor too long. 

I didn't make much use of the RC/SC sections so I can not comment on that. I will however say that you will find the SC portion very useful if you are a non-native English speaker with somewhat moderate/poor skills with the language. It is almost impossible to develop an ear for the SC questions (unless you already speak/write really well and read alot). If that's you, I'd highly recommend the structured approach of the verbal section. 

That being said, I didn't make much use of SC for myself since this was not a problem area for me. 

I have some other general advice for any test taker:

1) DO NOT SKIP the error log. It is one of those things that you wonder why you are wasting your time on it (especially when time is short!) but is extremely useful and will help you study methadically

2) The EGMAT Quant section is harder than the actual exam by a fair margin. This is a GOOD things as it prepares you very well for the actual exam and helps with both timing and accuracy 

3) You should spend 80% of your time learning concepts and mastering those and only 20% of your time doing practices and mocks. Repeated mocks will NOT improve your score meaningfully. If you have an accuracy problem > master the foundations. If you have a timing problem > master the foundations! 

4) On the verbal section of the exam, draw a 5 x 5 grid (like an excel sheet). The top row should be labelled A, B, C, D, E and the first column should have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Make three of these for all 30 questions. As you read the SC questions, use grammatical errors to identify and cross out 3/5 choices. These will leave you with two choices. This is where it gets harder. If you can't find grammatical mistakes anymore, chose the more elegant solution (which may not always be the shorter solution!).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Background:
Before joining e-GMAT, I tried T.O.P One Percent because they claimed to be the best and boasted about students getting top scores every day. Sadly, they didn't teach me anything, and it felt like a waste of time and money. I even doubted their honesty. After two and a half months of learning nothing from them, I took my first GMAT test and got a 680, all on my own. I realized I needed help to do better, so I looked for something different.
Why e-GMAT?
I needed a flexible way to learn because I had a busy schedule like many of you. e-GMAT offered that flexibility. I could study at my own pace and choose when to take the exam, whether in 15 days or a month.
About e-GMAT:
What's great about e-GMAT is that they focus on helping you build your skills. They understand that the GMAT tests your abilities, so they prepare you accordingly.
e-GMAT's course covers master comprehension, sentence correction, critical reasoning, and reading comprehension. In master comprehension, they teach you how to read effectively during the exam, which is very helpful, especially for non-native speakers. Their pre-thinking and meaning-based approaches are awesome. With critical reasoning, where answer choices are very close, pre-thinking is essential.
The course gives enough time for each section, and e-GMAT provides useful tools like Scholarnium to track your progress and Sigma X mocks that resemble real GMAT tests.
Strategy Experts:
One of the best things about e-GMAT is the support of experienced GMAT experts like Rashmi Ma'am. She helped me a lot by analyzing my quizzes and providing videos from GMAT experts like Harsha Sir when I needed them.
LMP (Last Mile Prep):
The LMP program teaches you about the GMAT algorithm, time management, and how to be ready for the test.
In short, if you're preparing for the GMAT, I highly recommend e-GMAT. Their flexible program, expert guidance, and useful tools will help you succeed.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey with a focus on mastering the fundamental concepts, rather than relying on shortcuts or tricks. Based on recommendations from friends, I subscribed to eGMAT on March 23, 2023,  took a mock exam in which I scored 640 and began my dedicated studies.
I Started with the Verbal section, following the structured approach outlined in the course. For Critical Reasoning, I found that pre-thinking and strong elimination strategies worked exceptionally well, making this section my best. Sentence Correction was a challenge for me as English wasn't my strong suit. I delved into the basics, learning all the rules and then shifted my focus to a meaning-based approach. Over time, I discovered that dedicating significant time to understanding the question's meaning increased my accuracy from 40% to around 80%.
Reading Comprehension posed difficulties due to the language and passage volume, but I adopted a dedicated approach. I read passages wholeheartedly, which, though time-consuming initially, eventually enabled me to connect with the content. This connection made reading even long passages easier. Combining this approach with elimination strategies increased my accuracy from 50% to around 80%.
Parallely, I revisited the Quant module, covering concepts and solving quizzes. After completing the module, I took Sigma mocks, consistently scoring around 740 in the remaining five mocks. Based on these scores, I booked the exam appointment  GMAT for July 21, 2023, and began revising through eGMAT's recommended Last Mile program.
However, my test day turned into a disappointment as I scored 670 (Q49, V31). It was a huge learning, highlighting the importance of test-taking strategy and time management. My time management was abysmal; I completed the verbal section in just 45 minutes. Exam stress didn’t let me follow my practiced approach.
Afterward, I consulted with Dhruv, my mentor from eGMAT, who emphasized the need to simulate the exam environment. I promptly scheduled a second appointment for August 22, 2023. I focused less on syllabus content and more on practicing my approach with mocks and official questions. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the best health on the second exam day, waking up with a headache. I decided to switch the order, taking the quant section first. By the time I reached the verbal section, my headache had disappeared, and I felt much better. During the verbal section, I stuck to the strategies I had learned, particularly the meaning-based approach for Sentence Correction and Elimination framework for RC and CR.
IR and AWA were not my top priorities, so I gave them my best without excessive worry. Upon completing the exam, my score flashed on the screen: 720 (Q49, V40). I wanted to jump out of my chair, but I controlled myself as other candidates were still taking their exams. This experience taught me the value of preparation for the test-taking environment and the importance of adhering to my well-practiced approach.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","0","0","","","September 22, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi mohan1597

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:- First thing that stood out for me was the weekly plan that e-gmat provides once you enter your target score. This really gives one a good picture of the time needed per week to cover all the concepts.
- The course material is very strong. They focus on approaches and techniques to really solve GMAT questions well. Payal does a wonderful job explaining the concepts. 
The question bank that e-gmat has is very strong. It is highly representative of the official GMAT questions and in some cases is also harder which makes students well prepared/
- The portal is easy to use and the analytics provided is very helpful. The Sigma X Mocks are very insightful and very similar to the official GMAT (better than the official mocks which are generally slightly on the easier end)Would make the product better:None at this point. It is one of the most comprehensive products available for preparing for GMAT.I had already given the GMAT once on Jul 11, 2023. I got only a 700. Although, I touched the 700 mark i felt my skills were lacking especially in Verbal. Many questions in the exam went over my head and I was not having a strong approach to solving RC and CR questions. As soon as my exam got done, I knew I have to retake it. I googled and came across e-gmat.
I chose e-gmat because 1) It had its own question bank which I desperately needed since I had pretty much exhausted the OG questions during my first prep and 2) it provided me with a week by week plan on how to tackle learning the concepts.

I immediately enrolled and within 1-2 days got a study plan from one of the assigned mentors. I started and found the Verbal modules very good for SC and CR. The meaning-based approach in SC was quite eye-opening and sub-consciously strengthened my concepts that I ended up getting 98th percentile in SC n my second official attempt. I also had a significant improvement in CR. The pre-thinking approach was very helpful in breaking down complex CR arguments. Earlier, I was always confused between two options, but pre-thinking hugely improved my accuracy. These are the areas I primarily needed improvement and the course material really strengthened my concepts.

Once I was good with the concepts, the in-module quizzes and the cementing quizzes really helped me to become test ready. I actually found the Hard cementing quizzes harder than some 700 level GMAT questions. Initially, this did appear daunting especially for Quant but when you start solving such high quality questions, you are really well prepped for any tough question the official GMAT throws at you.

Once the necessary prep was done, the Sigma-X mocks were very very helpful. The block wise analysis that the mock provides really helps you identify weak areas and helps you focus on getting higher scores. These exams are very very similar in level to the official exam. The official mocks are in fact little easier and can be misleading. I did find the sigma-X mocks from e-gmat to be quite accurate.

Lastly, the strategy experts who help with 1x1 guidance were very good. I worked with Akash, who was very supportive throughout and corrected me when I went offtrack.

Overall, e-gmat is highly comprehensive, helps one build their fundamentals, has great questions and mocks which can make you test ready and I highly recommend it for anyone at any level of preparedness who wants to take the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","0","0","","","September 20, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear SrinivasPrabhu,

																			by score report","Points","Location","In my 1st attempt at GMAT, I scored a 710 (Q50 V34). For my 1st attempt, I had solved OG questions and taken official GMAT practice tests but I was inconsistent with my Verbal scores, probably because of lack of proper techniques for various question types and lack of knowledge of my weaknesses in specific Verbal question types.

So, after my 1st attempt, I evaluated various perp providers. e-GMAT stood out to me as they seem to have a very robust data-driven platform which can reveal a test-taker’s specific weaknesses in question types. When I spoke to an e-GMAT representative, he told me that I was eligible for Last Mile Push (LMP) Program for Personalized Preparation guidance by a mentor. The data-driven platform and LMP sealed the deal for me and I went ahead with e-GMAT.

Experience with e-GMAT platform:
Highlights from Verbal section:
•	e-GMAT’s Master Comprehension section was extremely helpful. Although test-takers may be able to read English, they may not be good at reading English for GMAT. Learning how to read properly for the test can make a massive difference in Verbal.

•	The course is laid out in a systematic manner which helped me build my Verbal abilities starting with fundamental building blocks and thinking frameworks of various question types and ending with full-fledged GMAT style questions.

•	This gradual ramp up helped me digest various techniques and processes and enabled me to be more consistent with my Verbal scores.

•	The platform accumulates high quality data in-depth data about accuracies in various sub-sections in Verbal. Specifically, I found out that I was consistently weak at Strengthen questions which was a big revelation to me. So, I worked on my understanding of Assumptions and Strengthen questions. This helped me be equally good with all Verbal sub-sections which is required for an overall better score.

•	This deep-dive data is really useful for working test-takers like me who have limited time which they can devote to test prep.

Highlights from Quant section:
Since I was fairly confident with Quant section, I jumped straight into e-GMAT’s practice question bank. Again, the data from the platform pointed out niche areas in Quant which I brushed up. The key with Quant for me was to keep the ability at the same level while I improved in Verbal.

The PACE engine helped me to skip those parts of the course which I was already good at, save precious time and direct my efforts towards the sections which were most relevant to me. 

The Quant process skills highlighted in the course were crucial to deal with the silly mistakes which I made sometimes in tricky questions. 

In both Verbal and Quant, for each question, there is an active Q&A forum with discussions between the students and experts. These discussions helped save time whenever I had any doubts, which were almost always asked by previous students and resolved by mentors.

For my 2nd attempt at GMAT, almost 95% or more of the questions which I solved were from e-GMAT and I only took Sigma-X mocks. I believe that their question bank and mocks are of a high standard and more than sufficient for GMAT prep. 

Experience with LMP and my e-GMAT mentor:
My e-GMAT mentor for the LMP program is Abha. She has been extremely helpful throughout my prep for the test. She (and other e-GMAT mentors from time to time) has been a source of crucial guidance, support and constant feedback for regular course correction during my prep. GMAT prep can be a very challenging journey with constant ups and downs. Having a mentor watching over the whole process, guiding you in the right direction, giving words of encouragement at the right time, helping you navigating the course in the most time efficient manner and just being there as someone to share your prep-related difficulties is of immeasurable value.
 
I scored 740 (Q50 V39) in my 2nd GMAT attempt. Based on my experience with e-GMAT, I would highly recommend it to my fellow test-takers.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","0","0","","","September 20, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi sdgmat23,

Abha this side from e-GMAT, it was a pleasure mentoring you on this journey. 

From the very beginning, it was evident that you approached your GMAT preparations with a clear and well-thought-out plan. I've seen you put in the effort to understand the nuances of each question type, especially in the Verbal section, and it's been a pleasure to witness your progress. Here is an image where you have improved from 50% to 80% accuracy in hard questions in SC.

I couldn't agree more with your assessment of the Master Comprehension section's value in GMAT preparation. You've rightly pointed out that while many test-takers can read English, reading effectively for the GMAT is an entirely different skill. 

The fact that you recognized the need to improve in Verbal, focused on strengthening your understanding of Assumptions and Strengthen questions, and achieved a well-balanced Verbal score of V39 is nothing short of remarkable. Here is image where you can be seen diligently putting in the efforts to master the Assumptions concept.

I originally prepared with another test prep company and scored a 700 in November 2022. As my mock score were way higher I wanted to give another attempt, which was when I encountered e-gmat's Last Mile Push Program. I worked with my mentor Dhruv for 2-3 months and he has done an outstanding job in leaving no stones unturned. During this process, I finished all the course work again even though I already did the entire preparation part through another test prep company so that EGMAT's algorithm could find my strengths and my weaknesses. After completing the course work, my mentor Dhruv gave rigorous exercises almost every few other for the 2-3 months. I also did all the questions on scholaranium, which is a great resource by the way. The tests on scholaranium are a great way to build endurance required for the actual exam. Though I found a few questions to have ambiguous answers or the questions themselves to be confusing without additional info, they are, for the lost part, very well framed. My official mock score were in the 740-760 range whereas the EGMAT's mocks were around 710-720. Even though I couldn't replicate the exact performance in the actual attempt for reasons unknown at this point and scored 20 points lower than my previous official score, I would 100% recommend EGMAT's LMP program and my mentor Dhruv as well for any test takers looking to pursue EGMAT course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=25#","0","0","","","September 08, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi S2GmatPrep

But hey, why settle for ""decent"" when you can shoot for the stars, right? Thanks to eGMAT, I managed to skyrocket my score to a jaw-dropping 760. Let me give you the lowdown on how this all went down.

Alright, so I was already riding high with my starting score, and eGMAT hooked me up with their ""Last Mile Push"" Program. Fancy name, huh? Basically, it's all about taking you from good to crazy awesome. They paired me up with this rockstar mentor, Abha. She did this deep dive into my previous 730 attempt, sussed out where I was lagging, and then cooked up this super-tailored one-month study plan. Knowing that someone's got your back in this crazy GMAT journey? It's like a boost of confidence injected straight into your prep.

Here's the kicker – I was a bit of a champ in Quant, with a sweet Q50/51. So, all the spotlight was on Verbal. Critical Reasoning and Sentence Correction? Those were my pet projects. eGMAT's got this ""Meaning Based Approach"" for Sentence Correction that's like a secret weapon.

And just when I was getting sweaty palms about running out of official mock exams, eGMAT introduced me to Sigma X mocks. These are like mock exams on steroids, with super detailed analysis to help you fix those weak spots.

Bottom line, my eGMAT ride has been like a rollercoaster of awesomeness. From 730 to 760 – can you believe it? Personalized guidance, Scholaranium, and eGMAT's fantastic platform – it's like they held my hand and walked me through the GMAT jungle. If you're thinking of taking the plunge, I'm waving the eGMAT flag like there's no tomorrow.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hey Folks! I recently took the GMAT for the 3rd time and got a score of 780 (V47, Q51) which was a 60 point improvement from my previous score of 720 (V38, Q50). I would like to share what was different in my approach this time and what enabled me to get to the 99th percentile.
When I started preparing, I took the free trial of E-GMAT and of another very prominent online coaching platform. I was quite satisfied by the E-GMAT course structure and not to mention, the interface. The free trial was of great help as it gave me a taste of how interactive the course would be.
Here are some things that I really liked about e-gmat and that helped me get to this score:
Course structure
The e-GMAT course is very well-structured. It starts with a diagnostic test to assess your strengths and weaknesses. Then, it provides you with a personalized study plan based on your results. The course is divided into modules, each of which focuses on a specific topic. The modules are well-organized, interactive and easy to follow.
Course content
The course content is very comprehensive. It covers all the topics that are tested on the GMAT. The video lessons are clear and concise, and the practice questions are very helpful. I especially liked the Meaning-Based Approach to Verbal Reasoning, which helped me to improve my comprehension and accuracy.
Methods learned
I learned a lot of valuable strategies and methods from the course such as:
•	The Meaning-Based Approach to Verbal Reasoning
•	The Pre-Thinking Method for Reading Comprehension
I would strongly recommend one to understand and master both of these in order to attain a very high accuracy. These methods helped me to improve my speed and accuracy on the GMAT.
PACE time saving in quants
The PACE Method was particularly effective and helpful for me in Quants. Since I already possessed a foundational understanding of nearly all concepts in Quants, I saved A LOT OF TIME using PACE, which helped me identify the concept modules that I could skip. Therefore, I was able to successfully allot this time to further hone my verbal skills.
Quality of questions, mocks, and analytics on the platform
The quality of the questions in the e-GMAT question bank is very good. The questions are similar to the ones that are actually tested on the GMAT.
The analytics on the platform are very useful for tracking your progress and identifying your strengths and weaknesses. The post mock analysis becomes a cake walk as one is already provided with a lot of in depth analysis of one’s mock performance.
Other things I might have missed
•	I also liked the flexibility of the e-GMAT course. I could study at my own pace and time. Also, the course is constantly being updated with new content and features.
Overall, I was very happy with the e-GMAT course. It helped me to improve my score from a 720 to a 780. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about scoring a high GMAT.

I must say, you set out the right way by creating a Personalised Study Plan to create the roadmap of your reattempt journey.  

Having created this roadmap, you did not leave any stone unturned in this path to excellence. You went back to basics, built your foundation by learning concepts and applications and then practiced these on GMAT-like questions on Scholaranium to master the applications. See how mastering the pre-thinking approach in CR helped you reach 96%ile ability:

Despite starting out at a Q50, it is commendable how you took all the steps required to replicate this Q50 or improve to a Q51. It is great that you used the PACE engine to guide your pathway through the quant studies.  

We are happy to know that this strategy helped you save over 60 hours in quant prep. Just in Word Problems alone, you were able to save over 13 hours of prep time:

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Sanniddhya-scholaranium-stats-predict-Q51

- Predictable mock exams
- Personalized Mentorship program to achieve your target scores was the single best part
- The mentors and SME's genuinely want you to succeed and work with you patiently through your journeyWould make the product better:- More emphasis on solving Hard questions without timing to get the process solidified would help some student avoid attempting Hard cementing quizzes just for passing sake
- Optional Study plan for students to work on Verbal and Quant simultaneously to avoid losing the Verbal momentumMy journey commenced thirteen months ago when I made the deliberate decision to pursue an MBA to advance my career. I began with an initial cold official mock exam, achieving a score of 580. In August 2022, I enrolled in the e-GMAT program after conducting some online research. Without a specific exam date in mind, I proceeded to complete the verbal course over a span of four months, although this pace was relatively slow compared to the tailored study plan offered by e-GMAT. Subsequently, I took a month-long break before returning to complete the Quantitative section, which took me two months. By this point, my confidence and proficiency in Verbal had diminished.

At this juncture, I sought guidance from e-GMAT's mentors to establish a more structured approach. With the assistance of an assigned mentor, my efforts began to fall into place, and I achieved a score of 710 in an e-GMAT mock test. In May, despite being only 80% prepared, I made my first attempt and scored 680. This was followed by an invitation to the Last Mile Push program, which enabled me to intensely focus on identifying weaknesses and refining test-taking strategies. I attribute my progress from 680 to 740 to the significant impact of the LMP.

Unfortunately, my second and third attempts did not yield the desired results, with scores of 700 and 660 respectively. It was at this point that I faced discouragement, as my mock tests consistently indicated a potential 740 score range. My mentor Abha played a crucial role in helping me overcome this obstacle, displaying more faith in my abilities than I did during this emotionally challenging journey.

Determined to make one final attempt, I concentrated intensely on Sentence Correction (SC) and Critical Reasoning (CR), which were my weaker areas. During this period, I received valuable insights from Harsha, the Verbal Subject Matter Expert (SME), which significantly improved my CR skills from the 65th percentile to the 92nd percentile. I focused primarily on following e-GMAT's meaning based approach and pre-thinking which are game changers for anyone trying to improve their Verbal score. 

I enthusiastically recommend e-GMAT to individuals embarking on their test preparation journey, provided they are willing to trust the process. The program's strong emphasis on following a systematic approach, combined with its personalized mentorship program, sets e-GMAT apart from other test preparation companies by a considerable margin.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=26#","2","0","","","August 24, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi jkarnik2,

When it comes to GMAT resources, this course takes the cake with its incredible study materials, Scholaranium, and Sigma X mocks - all essential tools for acing the exam. But what really sets it apart is the amazing support through the question forum and mentors. They've been a game-changer, giving me personalized advice that's been crucial in turning my weaknesses into strengths. Huge shoutout to my mentor, Dhruv Joshi, for helping me throughout my journey.

From the basics to advanced strategies, the course structure is on point. It covers everything you need for the GMAT, including Integrated Reasoning. Whether you're tackling Quantitative, Verbal, or Integrated Reasoning, the materials are designed to work for all kinds of learners.

One thing that really helped me was the Adaptive Learning platform for Quant. This feature looked at how I was doing and then tailored lessons to what I needed. It's like having a personal coach making sure you're focusing on exactly what will push your score higher. Definitely made my study time way more effective.

The sheer amount of practice questions, mock tests, and timed quizzes helped me not only get comfortable with the test format but also build the stamina needed for the real deal. It totally changed how I approached each section of the GMAT.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I commenced my GMAT preparation around mid-February 2023. While I had a strong aptitude for Quants, the Verbal section, especially Sentence Correction, posed a challenge for me. Thus, my primary focus was on improving my verbal skills.

I initiated my preparation by grasping the fundamental concepts of verbal reasoning. My objective was to engage in extensive practice, as I believed that consistent practice would enhance my performance. Despite this effort, I continued to struggle with the verbal segment, particularly in questions of a 700+ difficulty level.

In May, I took my first GMAT attempt and achieved a score of 700 (37/49). Post this attempt, I aimed to identify and address my weaknesses. This led me to enroll in the e-GMAT Last Mile Push (LMP) program. During my time in LMP, I was paired with a mentor who provided invaluable guidance. Together, we worked through the program and pinpointed the topics where I needed improvement.

I delved into the e-GMAT course to establish a strong foundation in verbal reasoning. The master comprehension course they offer is skillfully designed to illuminate the subtleties of sentence construction. e-GMAT employs a structured methodology for approaching verbal questions. Their meaning-based strategy for Sentence Correction significantly bolstered my accuracy in advanced questions.

To gauge one's proficiency, e-GMAT employs a cementing process, which enabled me to identify any gaps in my skills and rectify them. This process further solidified my conceptual understanding. The expertise of the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) was remarkable; queries posted on the forum received detailed responses within 24 hours.

e-GMAT played a pivotal role in enhancing my grasp of concepts and filling in knowledge gaps. The meaning-based approach for Sentence Correction proved particularly beneficial in elevating my accuracy. The quality and uniqueness of their practice questions are commendable.

The LMP program was instrumental in helping me achieve my target score. I extend my gratitude to my mentor for her constant availability and unwavering guidance throughout this journey. Her encouragement motivated me to push my boundaries, and her support was pivotal in my entire journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=26#","0","0","","","September 02, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear ayush021

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Scholaranium - verbal and Quant both.I started my gmat journey in the year of 2018. I took several courses including e-gmat's. However I failed to score in my first two attempts. Meanwhile covid happened. All of my family members including myself were infected. This derailed my preparation. But I always had the urge to score 700 at least once. In the beginning of 2023, I started preparation again. I liked e-gmat's course because of couple of reasons:
1. Modular approach. So that we can finish each topic of SC, CR and RC and we can practice each of those topics of each subsection. The best part is we can gauge our ability using scholaranium and then move to next section if we are happy with our ability.

2. Detailed explanation of each question. It helped me to understand my mistake. Conceptual knowledge we all acquire. The real test comes in harder questions when multiple concepts are tested in a single sentence and when we need to choose one from couple of grammatically correct sentences. Same for CR and RC also. In RC the main idea encompasses the complete passage. Some options may be true for most of the passages but miss one important point. That particular option cannot be the main point. The detail explanation helps to understand these points.

I was eligible for LMP program, Last Mile Push as I scored well in first sigma X mock. I opted for the program. However, I didn't do well in subsequent mock tests. My mentor Rashmi was very kind and helpful. Although this program was for 1–2-month duration, I had to stretch it for 6 months. E-gmat team has never raised any concern. I created multiple 1-1 sessions with her to understand my drawbacks and to improve test taking strategies. When I scored back-to-back 710 in the GMAT official mock, I booked the GMAT online and scored 700 (Q49, V36).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=26#","0","0","","","August 31, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear ArupRS ,

Question bank
Personalised content
Last mile programWould make the product better:A Android app will be extremely helpful.As part of my professional experience in the ed-tech sector, I have come across and evaluated content of various platforms. Let me evaluate e-GMAT on some key parameters

Pedagogy 
Pedagogy is the single most important parameter when evaluating any learning medium, not just ed-tech platforms. e-GMAT course does quite well on this front.
-There is a solid question solving strategy for each question type that you come across in GMAT - Quant, SC, CR and RC. 
-The strategy becomes important when you want to apply the concepts that you have learned to complex and varied problem statements. For example in SC, there is a lot of focus on meaning based approach.
-I also found the strategy to solidify concepts through cementing quizzes very helpful. Overall the course design felt very thought through.
-Typical attention span is less than 5 min in an online learning scenario and the e-GMAT course seems to have been designed keeping that in mind. You don’t keep watching videos for hours on end, there is plenty of practice interspersed to keep you engaged and solidify the concepts. It is not possible to complete a module without continuously engaging with it.
-I love the attitude with which the course is designed. It is not about tricks, but building ability. The end goal of what we are learning is not to just clear GMAT but build ability that will help during an MBA or professional career. This attitude is reinforced throughout the course and with this attitude, the time investment towards the course just seems so much more worthwhile.

Question bank size and difficulty level
-The question bank is quite sufficient. I was barely able to use 50% of it. (387/1067 in verbal and 337/1363 in quant)
-The platform also has a separate section to practise QG questions. All questions have detailed solutions.
-The platform allows you to design your own highly customised tests using this question bank (using either OG or proprietary Questions).
-One can also take up to 4 adaptive mocks in addition to the diagnostic mock one takes in the beginning. They were more than enough for me, I was only able to take 3.
-The question level is just slightly above or equal to GMAT level for all sections, which is exactly what you want. 
-The data analytics provided on questions is targeted and very helpful. It does not drown you in data based graphs and visuals but only shows some chosen key graphs that help you understand your performance and weak areas.

Platform 
- the platform is clean and easy to use once you get the hang of it. 
- It complements the learning pedagogy well. 
- The ‘PACE’ feature available in the quants sections is a real time saver. Based on the diagnostic test before each module, the platform auto skips some parts for you so that you can save time. I think I saved about 60 hours this way. 
- It works decently well on the phone browser. It would have been amazing if there was an app to complement this content and make it available for study offline.

Forum for doubt clarification 
- there is a forum where you can post queries or doubts that you come across while studying. Most of the common queries have already been answered so that’s very helpful. Typical response time is less than 24 hours.

Content errors 
- I did not come across any major glaring errors, which is a big deal for such a vast content. From personal experience, I know how difficult it is to achieve that.

Support 
- My mentor was Rashmi. Her support was crucial to my success. She typically gave me a detailed and helpful response within 24 hours of raising a query via email.
-Once I was done with my course and scored 740 in the first mock, I reached out to her to help me improve my score further. She informed me that I was eligible for the LMP (Last Mile Program) as part of which she gave me a detailed study plan after analysing my test results and the data of all the tests that I had given.
-The discussions, and videos analysing my test data brought so much clarity and helped me redirect my efforts in the right direction over the last 2 weeks leading up to the exam.
-Even though I performed poorly in the next two mocks, 730 each, she assured me that it was just a result of fatigue and not ability because the overall data showed a different picture. Her emails really kept me motivated and confident right up to the exam day.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=26#","15","0","","","August 09, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear guptavaibhav1393,

I think you have said all about acing the GMAT in this line - “It is not about learning tricks, but about building ability”. I am so glad that you recognised at the start of your prep and did not leave any stone unturned to build a rock-solid ability.

This image shows how this data-driven approach helped you increase your accuracy for Business and Economics passages from 34% to a 92%: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/guptavaibhav-improvement-in-RC  

In quant too, you leveraged the AI driven PACE feature to help you create an atomic study path to target your weaker areas. This strategic approach not only helped you save over 60 hours of prep time in quants but also helped you get to a perfect quant score. This image shows how the data on the platform was able to predict your Q51: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/guptavaibhav-excellent-quant-ability  

Effort, determination, perseverance and a never-say-die attitude is paramount to GMAT success. But what really brings all this together is a structured approach aided by a data-driven improvement strategy and an eye on the end-goal. As, you have rightly said - “The end goal of what we are learning is not to just clear GMAT but build ability that will help during an MBA or professional career.” It is this looking at the larger picture that helped you get to this astounding success. I am sure this spirit will help you succeed in what you have set out to achieve.

I heard about e-Gmat from GMAT club reviews and also from some friends, and found it as one of the most economical and focused GMAT prep program, so I chose to go with it. E-Gmat has its unique way for preparation planning. I was adviced to give one Sigma-X mock and on the basis of its analysis I was suggested full prep plan as per my timing availabilities. For a working professional, this kind of flexible plan can work well. I started doing Quant with PACE enabled mode which made me more confident in Quant as I found my strength easily and also saved a lot of my prep time so that I could focus on the weak areas. After that I started improving my Verbal part. I was always struggling in Verbal part but as I started doing modules it felt like I cleared many concepts that were very confusing for me. SC modules were quite good, while I found a scope of improvement in RC modules in the manner student can identify his/her weakness with ease. In the end, I gave 4 Sigma-X mocks and I can say that those were very similar to actual GMAT. I score exactly same in actual GMAT as I got in all Sigma-X mocks. Although e-Gmat has better UI for Sigma-X mocks than GMAT in actual has, the UI should be much more similar to the GMAT. That will help to create a similar kind of experience. In all this process my mentor Ms Abha M guided me whenever I got stuck somewhere and she also provided specific plans for me to follow to improve in perticular area.

Advanced analytics platformAfter my first GMAT attempt, I was looking for an excellent platform to practice and learn concepts, a mistake I made on my first attempt. During my first attempt, I decided to study verbal on my own and used GMAT Club extensively to find practice problems. After going through multiple reviews and trying out a few other platforms, I decided to join eGMAT online 360 program. I’m happy that I made the right decision.
As I already had 680 on my first attempt, I was eligible for the Last Mile Push Program (LMP). I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I was assigned a mentor, Akash, right from the beginning. Akash helped me with analyzing the ESR, identifying the knowledge gaps, and creating a custom action plan for approaching the course content. This plan was extremely helpful as it helped me focus on the topics I was actually struggling with. Also, he consistently monitored my performance and pushed me to get better scores in every practice and cementing quizzes. 
The course content is structured and very well explained, especially the SC (Sentence Correction) course. As SC was one of the topics I was struggling with, I started with SC, as per the plan. The approach eGMAT suggests and the simple explanation of topics helped me to improve my SC score substantially. The approach eGMAT suggests to solve CR questions helped in reducing the time I took to solve CR questions and scholaranium provided enough quality questions to practice these approaches. The inbuilt analytics platform helped me monitor my performance and identify the topics I should work on.
As I was scoring well in the quant section, I did not go through the quant course. However, after attempting scholaranium quizzes, I could see that some topics needed more attention. After going through the specific topics as per the modified plan that Akash suggested, I could see improvement in my scores.
Thanks to Akash and eGMAT team for the support they’ve given throughout the journey. I highly recommend this program for anyone looking for a course that covers everything from absolute basics to advanced topics.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=27#","0","0","","","August 04, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear GauthamManoj, 

Congratulations on your score of 730 with a Q49 and an outstanding V40! With this, you have crossed the 90th percentile mark in the Verbal section which is a rare feat being a non-native speaker. 

Scoring a V40 in Verbal is possible only when you let the processes become second nature to you. You used the Scholaranium analytics to understand that Parallelism and Comparisons are your weaker areas in SC. The below image shows that through consistent practice not only you improved your accuracy in these topics from 69% to 91%, but also you improved your timing from 1 minute 42 seconds per question to 1 minute 24 seconds per question.

																			by score report","","Location","Strengths:The Verbal module is their absolute strength.
Starting with Master Comprehension course which enabled me to dissect sentences better, pause at the right places, and infer the right meaning, the course provided all the foundations I needed.

The 'Meaning-based' approach to SC was easy to grasp and effective in nature. The course did not shove technical grammar details at all, and the nuanced approach to understanding the underlying meaning of the sentence helped me improve my accuracy in SC to a large extent. 

CR was my weakest part. Again, the 'Pre-thinking' part and understanding the 'Falsification scenario' of each question helped me to understand the passage tremendously. The CR module is a must for someone looking to get into the 90th percentile. 

Another strength is their Question bank - Scholaranium portal and the massively important data analytics which helped me pinpoint my weak areasWould make the product better:The Quant portion is too vast and for someone who's looking to increase from a Q47-48 to Q49-50, there can be a separate module for them to address their weak areas while keeping the momentum of the strong areas with regular practise.I started using E-GMAT after getting V28 in my GMAT attempt. 
I realised that my Verbal needs a re-approach from the absolute basics and hence, enrolled for E-GMAT after everyone recommended their course.
The course provided the perfect push, with excellent question banks to sharpen my skills. 
The cementing quizzes helped me strengthen my skills and the periodic reviews helped me to understand why I was failing in certain areas. 

As part of the Last Mile Push programme, my mentor Rashmi ma'am jotted down a perfect strategy plan for 3 weeks before my test date. It helped me to keep my focus and be consistent in my prep, which was mighty important. Other than that, she motivated me on my bad days and reinvigorated my sense of self-belief and confidence. I owe my performance to Rashmi ma'am and to the entire E-GMAT team.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=27#","0","0","","","August 04, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear chelseafan97,  

Congratulations on the 720 with a  massive 13-point improvement in verbal to a V41! What an improvement and what an achievement! It has been my pleasure being a part of this journey.  

I must say, you left no stone unturned in this journey to excellence. Starting from basics – by learning how to read the right way – you followed a structured approach to building your ability. See how doing Master Comprehension and internalizing the meaning-based approach really helped you get to a 90th%ile in SC:

This methodical approach of building a rock-solid foundation and then reinforcing it through cementing is what really helped you reach 90th percentile in verbal. You then augmented your ability by using the data analytics on the platform to identify and fix your areas of weakness to reach that V41.  

See how in CR, this data-driven hyper-specific approach helped you master the Pre-thinking approach that helped you increase your CR accuracy to 86% while reducing the overall time to around 2 min:

I appreciate your feedback on the quant course. However, a course is wholesome only when it caters to students with all starting abilities! That is where the customisation of study plan and the PACE driven architecture comes in.  

As you know from your own journey, basis your starting ability in quant, we took the route of specifically identifying and fixing your weaknesses, enabling you to complete the quant course within 15 days. Even in the modules that you needed to go through, PACE helped you save time by identifying your strengths and creating an atomic pathway targeting just your weaker areas. See how this approach helped you get to a 70% accuracy for hard questions across all the sub-sections in quants:

2. Scholaranium questions
3. Great User InterfaceWith consistency, dedication, hard work, and structured learning, anyone can achieve a score of 700+.

After three attempts and sub-700 scores, in March 2023, after a year's break, I decided to embark on the journey again. I sought guidance from e-GMAT's support and purchased their online 360 course. I attempted the first Sigma X mock and scored a 720. Encouraged by the fact that I still had the ability, I joined e-GMAT's ""Last Mile"" program, where I received personalized guidance from Akash, their strategy expert.

Fixing the strategy:
Akash pointed out the flaws in my approach, stressing the importance of maintaining error logs, adopting the meaning-based approach in SC, using prethinking in CR and setting daily targets. I wholeheartedly embraced the process this time and shifted my focus from merely completing a high number of questions to improving the quality of my problem-solving skills using scholaranium, which offers the best set of questions available. As a result, I could see my accuracy in verbal’s 700 level questions improving significantly within 2-3 weeks.

For quants, I practiced from GMAT club tests and e-GMAT’s scholaranium. 

Keeping an error log turned out to be a game-changer, as it helped me identify and rectify my mistakes. As my preparation neared its conclusion, my practice test scores consistently ranged from 720 to 750.

Filled with determination and with three months of dedicated preparation under my belt, I attempted the GMAT once more. This time, my efforts paid off, and the score that appeared on the screen was 720 (Q50, V38)!

My GMAT journey was riddled with challenges, but thanks to the invaluable guidance from the e-GMAT team, I finally achieved my desired score. I owe an increase of 16 points in my verbal score (from my first attempt to final attempt) solely to e-GMAT. 

Final advice:
For anyone preparing for the exam and facing challenges, believe in yourself, follow structured learning, and trust the process. Don't be disheartened by the success stories of those achieving elite scores in a short time, as everyone has their unique set of strengths and weaknesses. Stay committed to your journey, and with dedication, you can achieve your desired score.

Prethinking in CR
Process skills based approach in QuantIF I CAN, YOU CAN TOO…

If you have never taken a standardized test before and are worried about how you will fare in the GMAT, read on..
If you are dealing with issues such as nervousness and anxiety in your prep for GMAT, read on..
If you think you are out of touch with your studies and too old now to get a decent score in the GMAT, read on.. 

The Beginning
It all started with the decision to switch careers after 20 years. An MBA from a prestigious institution appeared to be the most appropriate bridge from government service to corporate. Hence taking the GMAT seemed to be the most logical step. After searching the internet for resources I subscribed to a particular test prep company to start with. I took their online classes for 3 months, in which they taught me the basics of quant and verbal. Having never taken a standardized test or anything that tested my quantitative and verbal abilities, I found this to be a good start. It was only during these three months that I came across gmatclub.com. 
As per the suggestion of the test prep company, after completion of their course, I revised the syllabus and took the first official mock test as a Diagnostic test. I was hoping to be somewhere between 650 and 680 at that stage. And with another 2 months of preparation, I hoped to reach my target of 700 +. However, I was in for a rude shock as I scored only a 540. Nevertheless, I prepared for another two months all the while using resources of the test prep company and GMAT club. After another two and half months, i.e. sometime in September, I took another mock test (free) from another test prep company and scored a 600. Needless to say, I was depressed by this. My abilities in verbal never gave me confidence that I could score above a v33. I kept preparing all through October on my own and took another mock test (free) this time on the egmat portal. I again scored a 600. 
I was undecided for some time whether I should continue preparing on my own using gmatclub resources or seek some other professional help. I decided to reach out to egmat this time. They give me a specific plan after having analysed my performance in their free SigmaX mock test. They told me my weaknesses and strengths and accordingly suggested me a study plan. This is what I was looking for. Somebody to tell me exactly what to do, since I had no clue how to proceed, and did not want to waste time in figuring that out. 

New Beginning 
I subscribed to egmat and my journey with them started in the first week of November 2022. I was assigned a mentor (Abha) who told me exactly where to start. To my surprise she told me that as per my performance in the mock test, I am already at an 89 percentile in SC, and so I could skip the SC module. However, I was suggested to go through the Master Comprehension module before taking the cementing quizzes in Sentence Correction. The master comprehension module of egmat was a game changer for me. Never ever had I been taught to read, the way Master Comprehension taught me. I realised reading and understanding are two different things. And in verbal on the GMAT, if you read a single word without understanding it in the overall context, you are doomed. Using the process that I learned in the Master Comprehension module and applying the ‘meaning-based approach’, I completed the cementing phase in Sentence Correction in good time and went on to CR. In CR, the ‘pre-thinking’ approach really helped me. I did use it earlier, but now I was doing it better, even in Inference questions – something, I earlier thought, did not need pre-thinking. I did take some time to clear the cementing phases in CR and likewise in RC. 

Quant, in Egmat, is ‘PACE’ enabled, I was told, and that would save me time by skipping modules in which I am comfortable. I started going through the sub sections, however, I could not clear all the cementing phases in one go. During such difficulties, Abha kept guiding me at every step. As I was going through cementing in various subsections, Abha told me to keep taking the ability quizzes to remain in touch with the subsections I had already covered. The most important part in quant is the process skills that egmat teaches you and their relentless pursuit and insistence on the same. To be honest it took me some time to realise that these process skills will make a big difference in the end. I always used to wonder how can someone decide what approach to take while dealing with high-difficulty problems and even solve them correctly within 2 minutes. I thought I could never be able to do so. But by following the process skills egmat taught me, I developed the confidence to do so. I was doing well in Number properties and Inequalities / Absolute Values – topics that appeared very difficult to me earlier. Every time I had difficulty in crossing the cementing stage, Abha would analyse my performance and if need be she would refer my case to a subject matter expert, who would then suggest improvements in the process I follow. 

Overcoming Difficulties

Having completed both Verbal and Quant modules, Abha then guided me towards the test readiness phase. I had some difficulty during this phase too, as I could not deal with my nervousness and anxiety during the tests. I was making silly mistakes too often and also falling short of time. I realised the importance of meditation sometime in February and practiced it daily. I believe it definitely helped me. In Feb 2023, my job required me to go out of station for two and a half months, affecting my preparation. But I made an effort not to lose touch as I had read experts’ views on gmatclub that big time gaps in preparation can put you back by several notches. (Regular studies for however small study-hours are better than long study hours interspersed with big gaps). This difficulty and the delay in cementing phases and thereafter in the test readiness phase were taking a toll on me as I was stretching the limits of my deadline for taking the final test. I returned to my base on 20 April and again started my preparation in full swing. It is during this time I realized that I am stressing myself way too much. I thought lack of sleep or rather lack of good quality sleep was a major contributor to my silly mistakes and nervousness and anxiety. Also as a result of sleep deprivation, I was not having quality in my study. I was just clocking hours without improving my abilities.  At this point in time, I decided to start getting at least 7 hours of sleep at night and in fact, started sleeping without an alarm. Having completed the last module of Quant (Permutations, Combinations & Probability) sometime in the 1st week of May, I took two weeks to thoroughly revise all subsections from the start. Thereafter, I revised all subsections for the second time taking around one week. During these revision cycles, I was solving Quizzes on egmat’s portal for validation and trying to cross their specified levels, sometimes failing to do so, sometimes succeeding. All through I was also taking validation quizzes for Verbal. One painful exercise all throughout was maintaining an error log. But I did maintain one, in excel initially as per egmat’s format and in my own format during the revision phases. What was important was to revise these error logs periodically.
 I decided to take the test on the 24th of June 2023 and accordingly took a mock test on egmat portal on the 18th June 23. (Too late to start taking Mocks but circumstances were such). I scored a 650 and was obviously dismayed. Having analysed the incorrect questions I realized a lot of them were silly mistakes. Abha suggested that I delay my test by at least two weeks while she works on my test-taking abilities. I did so and kept going through the actions that Abha suggested. In the meanwhile, I had to take leave and move to my hometown to tend to some unavoidable personal commitments. (That was the reason I planned to finish taking the test by 24th of June in the first place, but then one needs to adapt to changing situations). I took my second mock test on egmat portal on the 3rd of July and yet again scored a 660. After this, my anxiety was at its peak. I started doubting myself and was thinking that the last 7 months were a waste of time. Abha kept telling me that the problem is not in my quant or verbal abilities but in my ability to focus and concentrate and that is what I should work on. I believed her. I knew my abilities in quant and verbal had developed significantly. The only thing that could stop me from reaching my target score was my anxiety and nervousness. I needed to manage those feelings. An important point to note here is that I could never reach beyond the 27th question in Quant and 30th or 31st question in Verbal. So I had to guess the remaining questions. I needed to work on my time plan. I did read a few articles on timing strategies. But Abha was point blank. She gave me exact times when to bail out in Quant questions, SC CR and RC. To be able to follow those timings was the issue. 
At this point I spoke to my family and realised that I need to change my approach. I changed the way I meditated. But I still had doubts about whether I should delay the test by another two weeks. Eventually, I booked a test for 11 July considering that there will always be another chance that I could take. I took my last mock test on the Egmat portal on the 8th of July and again scored a dismal 670. After having analysed my mistakes in the test Abha again flagged the main issue which was my focus. 90% of the mistakes that I was making were related to my lack of focus. There was no problem that I could not do within 2 minutes when I used to solve it later on. Yet I was making mistakes on the test. I could feel the nervous energy building up in me prior to the test, clouding my ability to follow all the process skills. And that was making all the difference. While I could follow all the process skills when I was not taking a test in the test environment, I was unable to do so in test environment. 
Since I had already booked my test for the 11th of July I went ahead with the plan. Instead of fighting my anxiety and nervousness, I decided to take the test with those feelings. Accepting that these feelings will be there and I need to coexist with them on the test. In the last couple of days I did not take any timed quizzes or tests. I went through my notes, certain questions that I was repeatedly getting wrong, and some formulae that needed to be remembered. An important aspect that struck me during this time when I was reviewing a particularly difficult question (I got it wrong four times, in spite of reviewing it every time!) was the relevance of patterns. (Bit late in the day, but then as they say, “it's never too late to learn something”).  Since the GMAT is a standardized test, it follows a definite pattern. The difference between the brilliant and the otherwise is that the former are good at recognizing patterns quickly and using that knowledge to their advantage. For example; a question that has only one linear equation with two variables is generally not enough data to get values of both variables. But if there is any constraint imposed by the question, such as both variables being integers or any other such limitation, the data might be enough. Explore that possibility before marking ‘E’. Having understood this concept, one should be able to apply it to other situations also. For eg; when there are 3 variables x, y, and z, and the number of equations is only two, and there are no other constraints then one cannot find the values of x, y, and z. However, if the question asks the ratio of x and the sum of x, y, and z, or just the sum of three variables then the data is likely to be sufficient! In such problems, it is critical to recognize what the question is testing and proceed accordingly. These are just a couple of examples. If one can recognize this and other such patterns and apply the relevant process skills, any GMAT problem can be solved in 2 minutes.

As the test day approached, I told myself that a 680 seems doable and it may be enough to get admission to a decent Business school given my work experience. That was just my way of trying to lower my own expectations. After all, all the anxiety and nervousness were an interplay between my expectations and reality. The wider the gap between these, the greater the anxiety, nervousness and depression. On the test day, as I had read on gmatclub, I tried to keep every part of my daily schedule the same. Had a slightly early dinner hoping to sleep earlier. But I couldn’t. I had imagined this would happen and did not let it affect me. I tried to sleep, meditate, sleep, meditate, and so on till I finally fell asleep. My exam slot was at 0945hrs so I woke up at 0600 hrs. Had a light breakfast. Abha had advised me to carry a banana or an energy bar to recharge during the break. I got the essence of the advice and carried a protein shake instead. The BCAAs have helped me maintain energy levels in the Gym in pretty quick time and I hoped they would do the same here. I reached the exam hall at 0900 hrs. As the exam hall procedures began I started chatting with another aspirant, a young chap just 2 years out of college. I asked him about his mocks and he said he was scoring consistently between 700 and 740. Wished him luck and chatted some more. The Procter then guided us to the cubicles and I commenced with the much-awaited exam process. I had not decided which colleges I would select to send my scores to. I kept searching for ISB and it just wouldn’t appear in the menu. Selected the ones that appeared after searching for them - LBS, MIT Sloan and Michigan Ross. Then I tried searching for IIMs. They appeared. I then scrolled down to find ISB and selected it. This process took me quite a long time and the candidates in the next cubicles had already commenced their exam. I bring this up because such a delay could affect your state of mind negatively. But I had conditioned my mind adequately to not get bothered by such things. I was expecting hiccups and deviations from normalcy. I started the exam with the sequence I had planned for, Quant - Verbal - IR/AWA. I had developed a habit to look at the timer only after every 7 to 8 questions and had the block timings in mind. I was doing well on the timing part till the 2nd block (16th question with little over half the time remaining). As I approached the last 3 questions I had a good 6 minutes remaining - perfect. The 30th question was a typical geometry question (Area of a rectangle given with two variables in length and breadth) that I had solved many times. So I realized it's going to end up in a quadratic equation. As has happened many times during practice quizzes, I could not get the break up of the quadratic equation in a decent time. I did not waste time and took an educated guess and moved on with 2 minutes for the last question. The verbal part also went in a similar fashion as far as the timings were concerned. The last RC passage was short but savage – couldn’t make head or tail out of it. Took educated guesses and moved on – had a good 2 minutes for the last CR question. All in all, both the Quant and Verbal sections had gone in an unprecedented manner for me – completing them in perfect time. IR and AWA were my sore points as I had not practiced them at all. One should practice for IR at least a little bit. I missed out on attempting the last question in IR, but could complete AWA.  Having completed that part, something came up on the screen. I realized this might be the score sheet. It was quite bland – I was expecting a colorful graphical display as one has often seen in the ESRs. Nevertheless, in all the typed matter in a small font, a particular number caught my attention. It said 730. Before I could grasp it, the Procter had sneaked in behind me and asked me if I wanted to accept my score. Yes! Click ‘Accept’, pick up the passport and walk out slowly he said. While I was thinking about what had just happened, the Procter printed out a page and gave it to me. It was true – a 730 (Q49, V41). A certain numbness and disbelief that I felt continues to affect me in varying degrees till date….

Key Takeaways.
Choose the right resources for your preparation. The money spent in preparation will be only a small fraction of your MBA journey.
Abilities such as analytical reasoning, and critical reasoning come naturally to some, but others can develop these abilities through practice and following due process. If I can, you can too. I cannot overemphasize the importance of following process skills taught by Egmat. Payal’s (Payal Tandon) voice asking me to do so every now and then reverberates in my head even now.
Error logs are important. Find a way that suits you to maintain one. Revise it periodically.
Make notes of important and frequently appearing concepts and revise them regularly. Revision is the keyword here.
It makes sense to follow your mentor even when you do not understand how a particular action is going to help you. A mentor like Abha, and others in Egmat team would have coached many students like you. They know what they are doing, and where they are taking you.
Patterns – try to recognize patterns. You may not succeed immediately, but keep trying and you will. It will surely help you in more than one ways, it certainly did help me in Q No 30 of Quant section (at least) in my final exam.
Official Guide questions are precious, especially in Verbal. Do not use them to learn concepts. Use them only to validate your skill level after you’ve learned the concept. LSAT questions in CR and RC are good for learning concepts – there is no dearth of them on Gmatclub.
Meditation helps – it works slowly but surely. Start practicing it now! Anxiety, panic and nervousness are feelings you can’t wish away. Try managing and co-existing with them rather than fighting them. You may not realise when they have stopped bothering you.
Build test readiness and test taking abilities by taking 10 questions quizzes initially, then progressing to 15, 25, and 31, and so on. Egmat gets this done nicely.
Official Mock tests can give a better assessment of your preparation level. I couldn’t take any Official mock test in the run up to my final exam due shortage of time imposed by unforeseen circumstances. I could’ve delayed my test further but I wasn’t sure if things would necessarily turn favourable later on. Nevertheless, since I was guessing all of the last 4 to 5 questions in Quant and a couple more than that in Verbal of the egmat mock tests, I guess the mock scores couldn’t have been better.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=27#","1","0","","","July 26, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Nielgmat,

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hello everyone there!

After a long journey, I’d like to share with you a debrief of my journey in the preparation in the GMAT. This have been a tough process with a lot of ups and downs

I started preparing on December 2021, so it’s been almost 1 year and a half until I got my final score. This probably doesn’t fit with everyone else’s timeframe in the forum, but probably there are some non-native speakers (Latinos like me) who will find this insightful for their preparation

Let me tell you a little bit about me: I’m from Peru, majored in Industrial Engineering and nowadays working as a Product Owner in Retail Banking for SME (my career is really versatile here and it’s not weird finding industrial engineers in every working field such as consulting, finance, consumer products, technology, manufacturing and nonprofit/government)

I have a special interest with Entrepreneurship and it was in the last years of my career where I decided to dive deeper on this. That’s when I started to look at role models in that specialty. I found that USA was a good place to find what I was looking for and that’s how I met some Peruvians in Silicon Valley. I asked them what they did in order to get closer to that entrepreneurial environment and every response had something in common: a prestigious MBA and the importance of the GMAT in this goal. By then, my outlook had become clear.

It was on December 2021 when I decided to finally put hands on and started to look for options to prepare. That’s when I realized that there were not many options in Peru: 2 academies dominate the market share and neither of them offer a choice I feel comfortable with (they are mostly focused on shortcuts and hacks to ace GMAT). After some days of research, my co-worker who got 690 told me that he had good results in Verbal in an online course called E-GMAT. I was skeptical that an online course could help me towards my goal, but I decided to give it a chance. 

I was in awe after taking the Master Comprehension course. It was a total different approach in every section of Verbal. They were focused on – indeed- comprehend and understand what the question was asking for. I knew at that moment that GMAT was not going to be an easy exam, but rather a marathon. So, I took my first Sigma-X Mock to have a baseline and ended up with a 470

Overview of the course:
Completing the course took me longer than expected principally because my English foundations were not good. Happily, the course included every aspect for a non-native speaker. It is incredible how detailed the topics are and the quantity of exercises you can find there. Let me highlight how useful the feedbacks of the E-GMAT forum are too! (thanks Harsha, Stacey an Shraddha). I left TONS of question in their forum and every one of them got answered with a depth of detail. Taking an online course instead of a “live” one was never a problem.

In the math side, even though I had more foundations in numbers, I felt that GMAT Quant questions needed a total different strategy. Apart from that, it was my first time solving problems in English. Never had I focused before on solving math problems focusing on the details of the statement and trying to no get “caught” on those classic GMAT traps (for example: not evaluating all the scenarios). E-GMAT made my life easier by setting an approach for every type of question. This was really helpful for me in order to not “review” the problems in ALL the different angles possible but maintaining a fixed strategy and perfectioning it. Finally, it was amazing getting to know stats of my performance in a really precise way in each area. This made evident where I needed to invest more hours!

To sum it up, I’m really happy that this course had everything I needed in order to ace the GMAT. It covers every aspect of the topics in a holistic manner. Not only do the E-GMAT team focus on the quality of the questions, but also they have created a process in order to gain proficiency (cementing, ability quizzes, test readiness and their owns mocks are part of this). Having this depth of content was awesome for someone with my profile who needed to learn every topic.

About Scholaranium:
You can’t imagine the amount of effort I invested to succeed taking the cementing quizzes. These questions are TOUGH and really INSIGHTFUL in your preparation. But be sure about this: if you handle these cementing quizzes, you CAN surely move forward to the next topic.

I loved Scholaranium from E-GMAT (even though it gave me sleepless nights hahaha). The quality of the questions from the experts is amazing. That’s not something you are going to see on other platforms where they mostly “adequate” OG questions.

Last Mile Push:
On March 2023, I decided to finally schedule my GMAT. After taking 4 consecutive mocks in Kaplan and scoring 680 consistently I felt frustrated for not being able 700. That’s when I decided to wrote to Rajat Sadana from E-GMAT. He answered really fast and assigned Rida Shafeek to guide me in this road.

Rida is amazing. She landed a first plan for including these points:

•	Refining Math Topics (GEO, Probabilities, Combination, Permutations)
•	Ensuring Test Readiness in every topic with a plan of exercises for every week (this helped in getting used to solve mixed questions in a timed environment)
•	Specific tips in every sub-section where my performance was not good in the Sigma X-Mocks

This plan encouraged me to practice in a more structured way to gain more test readiness and build stamina. That approach helped me to gain that muscle to solve mixed topic questions and to practice time management. She suggested increasing the number of questions solved every day (and practicing verbal and quant in the same day). This helped simulating the GMAT experience a lot. Once the day of the exam arrived, it felt really natural for me to solve 60+ questions in 2 hours.

Sadly, my first official exam was not good. I ended up with 630 (Q49 V26). I was totally discouraged here. All the time invested felt useless and I started doubting about my abilities (“probably I was not good enough for this exam?” – the kind of questions that arrived in my head). I noticed Rida with this score and she did help me a lot trying to identify the flaws of my exam. We were both at shock since my last 2 Sigma X-Mocks gave me in average a score of 680. I found that I need more guidance in CR as well as improving strategy in the day of my exam regarding time management.

There were 3 principal areas to focus for my next attempt:

1.	Critical Reasoning
2.	Time Management
3.	Aggression in the first section (without compromising accuracy)

Time management was the key in my last month of preparation. Rida identified some bad practices in my mocks and she suggested me to change my strategy by using a time matrix. It worked!

Rida and the E-GMAT team also helped me scheduling a session with one of their verbal experts: Harshavardhan (Harsha) because - even after practicing CR – I was struggling with the questions. We had call of more than 1 hour where he deep dived on my approach towards CR. This session was mind-blowing. It’s amazing having the opportunity to talk with an expert on a topic like him. He made it evident where I need to focus the majority of time with a really detailed diagnosis. Until that session, I didn't know my mental process doing CR exercise could be split in 7 parts (for example: visualizing, understanding, details, falsification question, pre-think scenarios, analyzing options). Only after noticing that my biggest flaw was at analyzing options, then I could focus on a more intentional way on that side. He recommended to practice this in untimed manner and, only after feeling more comfortable with process, then I could go back with a timed environment. It worked!

From a personal and mental perspective, it was awesome having that mentorship support during the last stage of my preparation. GMAT has been a tough exam for me (a total rollercoaster) and Rida helped me in not giving up in these last moments when I started to feel frustrated, stuck and discouraged. Mental attitude and confidence play a big role in the day of your exam.

Let me share with you the results of my mocks and official exams in a chronological way:

470, Q30 V26 - Dec 7th 2021 (Sigma X-Mock)
620, Q41 V34 - Apr 7th 2023 (Sigma X-Mock)
710, Q48 V39 - Apr 9th 2023 (Sigma X-Mock)
660, Q46 V34 - Apr 15th 2023 (Sigma X-Mock)

630, Q49 V26 - Apr 16th 2023 (GMAT Official Exam)

660, Q48 V32 - Jun 11th 2023 (Sigma X-Mock)

- Scholaranium Questions 
- Data Driven Insights  
- Mentor SupportI first went through the overwhelming process of researching multiple GMAT prep courses, reading reviews and watching demos. After signing up for a free trial of the e-GMAT course, I chose to go ahead with the same for the following reasons. 
The course modules are comprehensive and well-structured with detailed focus on each sub-topic. All modules start with the basic concepts, building a strong foundation and then move on to developing the application skills needed to solve actual GMAT questions. 
The structured approach given in the quant solutions helped me achieve speed and accuracy. Such an approach with focus on question statement analysis and inference was particularly useful to me while solving Data Sufficiency questions, in which I previously struggled.  
The Verbal course starts off with a Master Comprehension Module and though basic, the reading strategies taught helped me avoid re-reading sentences and understand the given meaning. Such a skill obviously helps in all the verbal sections. 
e-GMAT's Scholaranium, an exceptional and vast question bank, offered immense value in my preparation. Its custom quiz feature allowed me to focus on specific areas and gradually work on my progress. The detailed statistics pointed out my weaknesses, enabling me to work on them.
And while I initially thought the Quant questions to be more difficult than the OG questions, I am glad my mentor encouraged me to keep solving those questions since I found my actual exam at a similar difficulty level.  I would not have been able to achieve a Q49 otherwise. 
Lastly my mentor, Dhruv Joshi who provided me 1:1 support as part of the Last Mile Program, was a constant source of discipline and encouragement. He drafted personalized study plans depending on my progress and pointed out various other improvements in areas such as my stamina and time management techniques.

The quizzes and mocks gave a very good analysis of my weak areas and helped me spend my already little preparation time wisely. I work 6 days a week and without the analytics given by the platform, I could not have prepared as effectively as I did.

Lastly, I want to thank Rashmi, who, by analyzing my previous score report, gave me a personalized study plan and tons of support and guidance. Her tips helped me stay calm on the exam day.

e-GMAT is a complete package and I highly recommend the course to anyone looking to score above 90%ile.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=28#","0","0","","","July 11, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Surya499,  

Congratulations on a tremendous 80-point improvement to 730! It has been a pleasure working with in this journey to ace the GMAT! 

I am glad that the verbal strategies helped you crack the 90th percentile in verbal.  A 12-point improvement is truly commendable and would not have been possible without your hard work, determination and a single-minded focus on building ability. See how following a structured approach of building rock-solid foundation and applying the pre-thinking approach in CR, helped you get to a consistent 75% + accuracy for hard questions:

I appreciate that you mention the value of a data-driven approach to improvement. Data helps us identify and focus on fixing our areas of weakness at a granular level. This helped us identify Physical Sciences and Bio Sciences passages as the weaker areas in RC. See how working on that helped you improve to an 88% accuracy here and helped bring down the overall time to 1 min 24 seconds:

I am really glad that this data-driven approach helped you manage the prep amid the hectic work schedule.  It not easy to balance prep with work, but you have shown that with determination and a structured data-driven plan, it is possible to ace the GMAT.  

I on behalf of the entire e-GMAT family want to wish you the best of luck in this new endeavour that you are setting up on.  

Wishing you all the very best,

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:-Structured approach
-Strong foundational concepts
-Enormous quality question bank
-Great mentorship supportWould make the product better:- Quant section can be reduced in quantity. However, they already have the PACE system which allows you to focus only on weaker sections in Quant.I started preparing for GMAT in January 2021. I tried to approach the GMAT by collecting random information from youtube and Gmatclub. I studied dedicatedly for a few months but I was unable to improve my score from 550s. On my first mock, I had scored a mere 440. After suffering for months and losing hope, I finally decided to sign up for the egmat course which proved to be a total game changer and helped me score a 710. 

The course structure of egmat is perfectly aligned for the GMAT exam. All modules of verbal and quant are beautifully crafted and as a student, it was very easy for me to navigate through the course and study smoothly.

The verbal course of e-gmat is a game-changer. The best part about their verbal course is that it focuses on building solid concepts and does not forces you to use any kind of tricks or learn any jargons. The meaning based approach along with the grammar rules in the course are more than enough to excel in SC. The prethinking approach in CR not just helps you to score better in the exam but builds a logical mindset to dive deep into an argument and question it. Overall, the verbal course is well structured and helped my reach V38-V40 in a very efficient way. 

The quant course of e-gmat is very detailed and involves a lot of quizzes and question types. Initially, as I did not like to study for quant personally, I moved along the course slowly but when I started realising that these concepts are helping me solve questions with good accuracy, I just completely committed to it. The quality and quantity of questions will make sure that you score atleast a Q49. Extra efforts can make you reach Q50 as well. 

The thing that helped me most was e-gmat’s mentorship support. I was working with Abha Mohan, she is not just a good mentor in terms of strategy building and exam approach but she also helps you in regards to mindset approach. I was about to quit my GMAT journey, but she was persistent that I should keep continuing as I have the ability to score good and ultimately, I did score good because of her. Under the last mile program, she helped me with hyper-specific plans and that really changed the game for me. 

The entire portal- Scholaranium, is well prepared and helps you build so many variations of quizzes that you don’t have to look anywhere else. The verbal and quant question bank allows you to pick questions from different subsections as well and this really helps when you want to improve a specific subsection. Their analytical approach will definitely help you to understand what is specifically lagging behind. 

Finally, the Sigma-X mocks by e-gmat are just a bonus on top of the course. These mocks are well prepared and provide proper analysis as well. Sigma-X mocks along with official mocks are more than enough for GMAT prep. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who wants a structured approach as well as mentorship support for their gmat journey. I was personally stuck in my GMAT journey for a long time and this course helped me sail through. 

Best of luck to all the GMAT aspirants!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=28#","0","0","","","July 20, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Neel7736,

																			by score report","","Location","Strengths:The following are according to me the areas in which the product stands out ( In the order of importance as per me):
1) Mentor support through the course. This support I think was most important to me as I could discuss all the issues I was facing during my prep and could obtain expert opinion.
2) A huge question bank in the form of scholaranium in both verbal and quant which gives more than ample questions of different difficulty levels. ( Best way to use them I feel is taking a quiz of 10 or 15 questions on a topic . Analysing each question after the mini-test. I recommend that before we go to solutions we should try the incorrect questions again after the test and see if we can solve them. )
3) Third in the rank would be the verbal section with its video lectures , practice quizzes and applications . As a person who knew little about how GMAT verbal works , this section provided me the foundation before jumping to scholaranium to solve questions.
4) The PACE feature in the quant section of eGMAT is also impressive as it identifies the areas where you need to work and which areas you may skip based on your performance in diagnostic tests. For someone who wants to save time on quant or is very thorough with concepts this feature is a boon.
5) Finally in the last mile push program , the mentor assigned to the student helps the student to ensure that his/her preparation level is sound enough to crack the score he is aiming at. The program consists of timelines , daily targets and assessment milestones which cement the learning of the individual and also give him confidence to take on the exam :) .Would make the product better:While prepping I saw that in case of some questions on scholaranium and practice questions , there is no video explanation by a SME. Its just a personal opinion that watching a video with a SME explaining how to go about a question helped me absorb all the concepts much better . This area can be looked into.It was somewhere in November 2022 when I decided to appear for my GMAT. I searched the internet and GMAT club and other such sources. My expectations from the course were that its offerings could help me create a proper foundation on theoretical level ( concepts ) and provide me enough practice material for putting those concepts to practice. An additional concern for me was the cost . eGMAT I felt that was the best fit for me on all these fronts.
After taking the course I started with the verbal part ( SC , CR and RC in that order). The course is so designed that it will guide you step by step in your journey and all you have to do is to follow this guidance with enough sincerity and conviction. I went along the course , gave the practice exams and appeared for the mock tests and eventually I could feel that I was beginning to understand what GMAT expects from me. Yes, I had my falls during the prep but these were more due to  my follies than any external factor. For example I exhausted the mocks fairly early when I was not even well prepared with the concepts. So all in all the course has all the elements in it to help one get to his target score. These include robust course material , fantastic practice questions in form of scholaranium , 5 mocks  and expert support. IMO anyone who goes through the course with good level of dedication is set up for a good score on the test.
The review would not be complete if I do not reemphasize on how much I benefited from the mentorship support of eGMAT. Rashmi Ma'am has all through guided me in this journey . A simple email such as ' how is your prep going'  was a reminder for me to keep on track and not deviate. Further the strategy session with her helped me realize where are stood in terms of prep.
Thank you Rashmi Ma'am , Thank you eGMAT :) A huge part of this 750 is because of the guidance provided by you.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=28#","0","0","","","July 11, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear AmiyaDash,

What stands out in the entire journey is your determination to make it to the top of the GMAT. I remember from the first discussion onwards how set you were to score a 740+ on the GMAT.  

You left no stone unturned! You did the entire verbal section diligently, first laying foundation by learning concepts and applications and then mastering the applications by practicing on medium and hard GMAT-like questions through cementing.  

See how this dedicated approach helped you improve your CR accuracy to a 91% while reducing the overall time to 1:48 minutes:  

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Amiya-CR-Accuracy-vs-Timing  

Amiya, it is this focused and structured approach that helped you improve across all the sub-sections in verbal and get to that V42😊  

It is commendable how in quants, you leveraged the PACE feature of the course to help you identify and selectively work through your weaker areas. I am glad that this helped you save 48 hours in quants, and in Algebra alone, you were able to save 13+ hours as seen here:

To falter is human! But what differentiates a winner is the ability to learn from these setbacks and use them as steppingstones to success. To have proved through this journey of yours that no matter what the obstacles or the setbacks, if one has his eye set on the final goal, no achievement is impossible!  

Amiya, I am sure you will go on to achieve great things in your future.  

I wish you all the best for your forthcoming interviews from all your dream b-schools.

																			by score report","","Location","If you're searching for a top-notch course to help you achieve your target score, I highly recommend giving e-GMAT serious consideration. After trying out several online resources, I can confidently say that e-GMAT is truly exceptional. It stands out not only for its extensive content and comprehensive course material for each topic but also for its dedicated team of mentors.

If you're aiming for a 98 percentile or higher, you may encounter a stage where you've completed the course but find yourself stuck at a plateau score of 700. Progressing beyond this point and achieving even a modest improvement of 10 points can be quite challenging. I personally faced a similar situation.

Before I purchased e-GMAT, I was stuck at a score of 700, relying on a strategy of analyzing mock exams and dedicating a week to practice my weak areas before attempting the next one. I would practice a large number of questions without a clear direction in mind. However, despite my sincere efforts, I couldn't break through the 700 barrier.

Realizing that there was an unidentified issue, I decided to invest in e-GMAT's 2-month online course, primarily for their dedicated mentorship. Luckily, I was assigned Rida Shafeek as my mentor. Rida carefully analyzed my mock exams and provided me with a day-by-day plan to address my weaknesses over the course of a month. I followed Rida's advice diligently, treating it as invaluable guidance.

What kept me motivated throughout the journey was Rida's constant encouragement and belief in my abilities. Even on days when my scores weren't satisfactory, she reassured me that I had a solid grasp of the concepts and emphasized the importance of my energy and self-belief in achieving scores ranging from 670 to 760.
During this process, I came to the realization that I had been focusing on identifying conceptual knowledge gaps or specific application techniques to break through the 700-score plateau, when, in fact, the underlying issue was something entirely different. Surpassing that plateau required nothing more than a boost in my self-confidence and belief in my abilities, and Rida played an instrumental role in helping me achieve that.

I must give full credit to Rida for my improved score. Her unwavering positivity and calm demeanor made all the difference in my journey. Without her dedicated efforts, achieving this score would have remained a distant dream. It is solely due to her guidance that I was able to make a significant improvement of 50 points within a month.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Harsha, the e-GMAT expert in Critical Reasoning (CR). A single one-on-one session with Harsha revealed the power of visualization, which transformed CR into a much more manageable aspect for me.
Some fantastic offerings provided in the e-GMAT course that worked for me (apart from the invaluable mentorship) :
1. e-GMAT’s Scholaranium 2.0 is an unbeatable asset. It helped me tremendously to focus and improve my weak areas while paying attention to the timing as well as the accuracy of questions with different levels of difficulty.
2. The LMP program is a boon for people who have limited time to achieve their desirable score. It offers a day-to-day set of activities for each day so that one can fully and efficiently utilize their each day.

Thanks e-GMAT! :)

CONGRATS ON GMAT 750!! 

This is Rida, your mentor. What a journey it has been! I am so incredibly happy to see you on the other side of the finish line. 

Navigating yourself out of a score plateau can be really tough. It can be a very frustrating and demotivating experience. But one thing was clear – you were in it to win it and were determined to succeed.

You worked constantly to identify weaknesses and worked to convert them into strengths. 

For example, in SC, where your ability was already on the stronger side, we identified certain key areas that could cause your score to drop. By working to fix these gaps, you were able to improve your SC ability to 90th+ percentile! 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Ridhi2306-SC-90thpercentile 

You also built methodologies that enabled predictable success, such as in the case of Critical Reasoning, where in during our initial discussions, you confessed to not having a good methodology to tackle questions and were instead playing it by ear. But, after putting in the time to perfect the pre-thinking approach (as well as a little bit of help from our CR fairy god mother, Harsha), you were clearly able to improve your stats. 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Ridhi2306-CR-Improvement  

Most importantly, you trusted yourself and the data to show that you were ready to take the exam. 

Ridhi, you have been far too kind to me in this review. But the fact is, just as I have always emphasised, that my belief in you was backed by numbers and data. From the get-go- you had the drive to excel, and I helped you channel those efforts in the right direction. I gave you the green light for mocks and then, for the exam, because your ability was clearly displayed over hundreds of data points! Though it was hard, you put in the effort needed to cut out the noise and focus on applying what you know. You didn’t let your own self-doubt be the Achilles heel of your prep. 

As the stats below show – you were 100% ready to ace the GMAT. 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Ridhi2306-V42-Predictability 

I wish you all the very best in all your future endeavours Ridhi. I am sure you will undertake your MBA journey with the same passion and enthusiasm you have displayed throughout your GMAT journey.

This boosted my ability. accuracy, and hence the confidence in these areas.

One of eGMAT's most valuable features was the strategic review of mistakes. The platform provided an Error Log, allowing me to track and categorize my errors and gain insights into my weaknesses, especially in critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The detailed explanations accompanying each question further improved my understanding. This review process helped me identify patterns, adjust my study approach, and enhance my performance.

The Last Mile Program (LMP) provided by eGMAT was invaluable in the final stage of my preparation. It helped me identify and improve specific pitfalls before the mock phase and provided guidance on time and stress management. The LMP instilled discipline in my study routine, taught me effective time management during the exam, and helped me develop a positive and focused mindset. The Test Readiness exercises and mocks simulated the real GMAT experience, building resilience and improving my ability to handle pressure. The LMP played a crucial role in boosting my overall performance.

The mentorship of Rida was a game-changer in my success. Her continuous support and guidance were instrumental in my progress. Rida was readily available and went above and beyond to address my concerns and provide personalized feedback on my practice exercises.

Throughout your journey, you focused on achieving proficiency in verbal. It is gratifying to hear that our approaches, such as the meaning-based approach in sentence correction, pre-thinking and visualization for critical reasoning, and visualizing and internalizing passages for reading comprehension, boosted your accuracy and confidence in these areas.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1) Cementing quiz - Since e-gmat has been in the business for so many years, they have identified a few questions which test topics appropriately to judge if you have understood the topic sufficiently. These quizzes are definitely helpful in judging your progress!

2) Way of teaching - Each module starts from the basic and they ensure that the foundation is strong for you to grasp the advanced concepts. Don't get me wrong, you can skip the modules on basics if you are confident, however, it definitely is very helpful   

3) Last Mile push program - In this program a personalized coach will be assigned who will work with you to help you reach your target score. It's very useful for those who are stuck at a particular score level; the coach will help you identify your weak areas and use your performance data to suggest appropriate ways to improve your score. My performance coach was Rashmi, can't thank her enough for her support!Would make the product better:1) The product that I took was completely online and contained pre-recorded lectures. I think a combination of certain live lectures on specific modules may be helpful.

2) Modules don't have an option to watch the video at a higher speed. For someone who has already prepared for GMAT earlier, the not have the option to be able to speed up the videos takes away the flexibility for those modules in which person is well versed. This option is especially important for people under last mile push program since usually they'll be on a shorter timeline and hence, would want to cut through such modules.It is definitely one of the best products to help you in your gmat journey. And I'm writing this review after trying 2 other products besides E-gmat, so I can say it with certainty that it'll help you irrespective of what point in the journey you're at. 

I had a difficult time improving my verbal score, however, the e-gmat way of teaching verbal- cementing quiz, practice quiz, error log, concept quiz - was  helped me increase it from V36 to V41. 

It also offered quite an extensive module on quants coupled with an AI module, which basis your performance on each concept lets you skip those concepts. This saves some time for repeaters. 

All in all, please don't hesitate to buy this product.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","0","0","","","June 27, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Mrigankmg02,  

Congratulations on the 730! It has been a pleasure working with you through the Last Mile Push program😊 I am glad that you found the course structure, quizzes and the mentorship helpful in this journey from V36 to V41.  

Someone with a score of V36 is already strong in concepts. What is needed to improve from here is a change and tweak in the process of solving questions. This is where a data-driven approach to identify and work on areas of weakness helps really solidify this approach. See how this data-driven, structured approach helped you improve to a 90th percentile across all the verbal sub-sections:

It is good to know that the PACE-engine helped you save time during quant preparation. I can see that you saved over 30 hours of prep time in quants because of this AI – driven approach. An example is the “Functions and Sequences” module in Algebra, where PACE recommended that you skip most of the files and focus only on practicing on GMAT-style questions:

Better mentorshipThe e-GMAT course has amazing content and can be highly beneficial to certain individuals. However, I personally don't think it's suitable for someone like me. GMAT preparation involves two factors: self-study and mentorship. While e-GMAT offers mentorship, I didn't find it particularly helpful because after the initial connection with my mentor, the follow-up was irregular. As someone who requires constant reassurance but hesitates to ask for help, this was a drawback for me. Regarding self-study, the material for Verbal was excellent, although I didn't spend much time on Quant, but I believe it would be good as well.

Here's a breakdown of the different sections:

1. Master Comprehension: This section was a game changer for me. I used to struggle with RC, but the strategies provided helped me improve my reading and understanding of passages.

2. Sentence Correction: The course covers all the necessary topics, and anyone who completes all the modules will definitely see a significant improvement. The verbal explanations and webinars by Shraddha Jaiswal were particularly great.

3. Critical Reasoning: This section was controversial for me. While many people have seen improvement using the prethinking method, it didn't resonate with me personally.

4. Reading Comprehension: Overall, the strategies mentioned in this section were helpful in boosting my confidence and understanding of passages.

5. Quant: I didn't focus much on Quant, but the material seemed fine to me. I attended some webinars hosted by their Quant Expert, Shweta Koshija, and they were amazing. However, I found those webinars more helpful and concise than the course itself. The concept videos were neither impressive nor disappointing. I had already learned better strategies for those types of questions from other sources.

Regarding the additional features:

1. Scholaranium and SigmaX: I really liked the concept of Scholaranium, and I scored well on the cementing and ability quizzes. However, the SigmaX section was quite different. I never scored above 680 in the SigmaX mocks, but I ended up scoring 710 on my actual GMAT. It's not that the questions on SigmaX were harder, but I didn't like the quality of some of them. No test company can perfectly replicate the official scoring algorithm and question quality, but Scholaranium and SigmaX still give you a good idea of how to approach the exam. I would advise not to worry too much about scores in any mock exams other than the Official mocks.

2. Video speed option: It would have been helpful if there was an option to change the speed of the videos. While I understand that the content creators want students to absorb the material at a specific pace, having the option to fast forward would save precious time for those who need a quick recap of the concepts.

Lastly, one of the reasons I didn't invest much time in Quant is because I had previously scored Q50 and wanted to either maintain or improve my score. Going through the concept videos at the given pace seemed like an unnecessary time investment for me, so I decided against it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","1","0","","","July 01, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear TargetKellogg2024,

																			by score report","","Location","I started my prep in Aug 2022 with a blind official mock test 540, and seeing such a low score, I was determined to improve. I am not a standardized test person or a reading person(not a native speaker), and I had been away from studying for 9 years, so I felt that I had to do a lot of prep work. Initially, I started with Magoosh Verbal - at the end of Aug 2022, and then I did the Manhattan Prep Verbal book in December 2022. At this point, I felt that I had gone through a lot of material, but it was all jumbled in my head. Not feeling confident enough in Verbal, I did not move on to Quant prep. 
So in mid-Dec, I started with TTP and studied their comprehensive material for the next 5 months, which helped me become super clear and confident about all concepts and approaches. 
I gave official mock 1 in May 2023 and although my accuracy in verbal was very high my timing sucked, and I ended up guessing the last 11 questions(which nearly all ended up being wrong) and got a 640, which was disheartening and I was running out for time for my first attempt planned date, and after analysis if found that my SC accuracy was very high, but the timing was horrible.
So on the next day, I took up E-Gmat to get my timing strategy right, I took their Sigma X mock 1 with a primary focus on not running out of time and got a 680, and based on their GMAT like ESR I saw that my SC ability was worst(36 percentile). I did E-gmat's master comprehension and SC section in 1 week and then took official mock 2 and got 710, which I felt was a good improvement, and then after doing some cementing SC exercises(which I felt were hard for me even after all the prep) and following some guidance of Aakash(e-gmat mentor) I took sigma mock 2 and got 730 with SC ability now at 76 percentile. After this, I just did OG questions till my GMAT online date, which was coming very soon, and got 700(V38, Q49). 
I feel that my timing has improved thanks to E-Gmat cementing exercises, which gave me the confidence to book the test.
Timing in SC has been a major problem for me since day 1 and based on feedback from the platform's metrics and even from Aakash, I still have a lot to improve in timing my SC strategy(my avg is above 2min 10sec).
Just wanted to share my journey till now and say special thanks to all the platforms and mentors who have helped me get here. For my next attempt, I am going to continue prepping further with E-gmat, so that I can close the remaining gaps in my strategy and knowledge.

Would love to see how features such as PACE continue to evolveE-GMAT is a great platform, using data driven insights to help students find an edge. I had already written the GMAT before and had a fairly solid score of 720 (Q49, V38). 

Since I come from an overrepresented background and am targeting top 10/15 B-Schools, I felt I needed to push my score up a notch. However, the catch with starting from a higher baseline leaves room for improvement only at the margins, and I was unclear on how to proceed. 

This is where E-Gmat came in. Firstly, their platform is extremely user-friendly and analytics driven. This allows every student to assess their current level, highlight their areas of weakness, and build a study plan in sync with their goals and the amount of time they would be able to commit. 

Their content around verbal, centred around a meaning-based approach and prethinking, really helped strengthen my fundamentals. Similarly, it helped refresh my quant skills and fine-tuned my methods in this regard. The quality of questions, especially those of a higher level, helped test the intricacies of each concept and ensured that any weaknesses were highlighted. By following their course, one can get an extremely process-driven approach towards their current level and path to improvement. 

As an added bonus, I was part of their last mile push program which offered me the opportunity to work closely with a mentor. This includes steady correspondence over email and 1:1 sessions approximately every 10 days or so. My mentor Rashmi really helped, both in terms of diagnosing weak areas and building an action plan, as well as pushing my effort levels and ensuring accountability. 

I ended up pushing my score to a 740 (Q49, V41) and E-Gmat played an important role in pushing me towards this improvement.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Reliability and accuracy - closest to the actual GMAT.Would make the product better:NAI will divide my e-GMATs review into 4 sections as below:

The Verbal Section 
Sentence Correction: e-GMATs method of understanding the meaning of the sentence was very helpful for me. This method helped me to identify the error in the sentence within 30 to 40 seconds and then to mark the current answer within next 30 seconds by process of elimination.
Critical Reasoning: e-GMATs method of Pre-thinking the answer helps here for 90% of questions. For the rest of the questions such as Evaluate the method etc., they have a process known as Variance test which helps to identify the correct choice. Pre-thinking might not lead you to guess the correct answer every time, but it helps you to fix the structure of the passage perfectly in your mind and this fixing helps you to identify the correct answer quickly.
Reading Comprehension: e-GMATs method of immersive reading was a game changer here. Understanding the entire passage thoroughly before reading the questions helped me save a lot of time in the exam.
The Quant Section
Being already comfortable in quant, I used this section to refresh my concepts. Learning quants with such an approach was a major mistake as you can see from my quant score. I am planning to retake GMAT to score better in quants. So I will post a detailed review for this section post this attempt.

Quizzes:
After learning all the basics I started taking custom Quizzes. A custom quiz is where in you can design a quiz the way you want. So I generally designed my quizzes to replicate a subsection – Quant or Verbal. This approach helped me to improve on my timing and accuracy tremendously. Apart from custom quizzed I also took the cementing quiz (to cement the concepts I have learnt) and ability quiz (to test my ability on a particular topic). Ability quizzes are helpful in that they will show you a true picture of your ability in a particular section in terms of percentiles.

Mentorship:
I was struggling to clear the expected cutoffs for reading comprehension in the cementing stage. My major hurdle was timing, as I used to take a lot of time to read a passage. Dhru Joshi, my mentor, helped a lot here by providing me with various articles and with various links to different news websites. He also asked me to go through atleast 2 such articles daily and practice the e-GMATs method on these articles. This practice helped me to improve my speed not only in ready comprehension but also in overall verbal section as I finished my verbal section with 5 minutes to spare and scored a V44.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","0","0","","","June 24, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi aniket1

Kudos to you on your impressive skill development in Critical Reasoning! Your dedication to internalizing the Pre-thinking approach paid off and led to your consistent enhancement of CR accuracy. Having said that, your improvement on RC was a notable one. You used the reading strategies that allowed you to read and comprehend the passages accurately. Your improvement in RC ability is visible in this image below:

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:E-GMAT has tremendous amount of resources for every aspect of exam prep. I was at first astonished by the daunting amount of basic concept files that I have to finish before I dive into scholarium quizzes and mocks. 
Before I got to know E-GMAT, I didn't have any thorough concept for how to approach every sections and questions. 
However, following the entire curriculum for 2 month with patience, I finally made achievements at scholarium quizzes and started to interact with e-GMAT team from then.Would make the product better:Concept files, Scholarium quizzes, Cementing process, Sigma-X mocks and other possible materials are all necessary steps to ace GMAT. 
Especially, Sigma-X mocks are very accurate indicator/predictor of your actual skills and scores. 
And, if you want to improve your score in a short period of time(maybe to 1/3 than preparing for your own), you'd better follow the e-GMAT instructors' guidance as much as possible.Before I met e-GMAT, my score was stuck in 660 until third attempt. I trusted my English skills, because I have usually achieved the highest scores at TOEIC/TOEFL reading comprehension. 
After I started to study with e-GMAT curriculum, I finally realized that I totally misunderstood the GMAT exam and decided to revise my approach as e-GMAT curriculum says. 
Also, there was a lot of support from e-GMAT professionals, from thorough plans to follow to timely response to all kind of inquiries. 
Though it took longer period than the e-GMAT team suggested because I have a full-time job and have up to 2 hours a day to study, I eventually saw the achievements at mock tests. 
Sigma X mocks : 680 -> 730 -> 720
Official mocks : 700 -> 760 -> 750 -> 720. 
Though the scores are fluctuating because I could not maintain the rigor of study plan due to work, the e-GMAT team's support and feedback for every mocks I have taken gave me further insights for my faltering points and actions to be done in the near future. 
So, even though I got 720 at my actual exam, I am pursuing for another exam with confidence. 
For me, visualization for every passage and sentence is the key to all the skills that follow. This is the most important basic mindset when you address various questions. 
Regardless of the difficulties of the questions, proper level of visualization and following pre-thinking will put you on the higher position than other test-takers. 
e-GMAT will make this happen if you are with them, and the advertisements saying ""600 to 750 in xx days.."" are not lies. You too, can be the very person who made miracle.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. Excellent Verbal course.
2. Difficult quant course ( Sharpens your quant ability to perfection)
3.SIGMA_X mocks are very close to actual GMAT examWould make the product better:More Mock tests would be helpful ( Especially for people who are giving multiple attempts)I purchased E-Gmat Online Course based on recommendation from my senior (who is currently at ISB) on Dec 22, 2022. As my aim was to get into Indian colleges, My target score was 700 and above.
As mentioned by experts at E-Gmat, It is very helpful to know your starting ability before even going for the learning. My first sigma-x mock yielded a 610. It gave me insights into the where my weak areas were and also gave me a good analysis of my Time Management.
I first went to tackle the Verbal section. I had extreme difficulty in tackling the SC and CR part. My RC was rather good at first. For SC, I went on with the course and tried to study all the grammar rules. But for the first 100 questions that I solved post the learning, I wasn’t doing great. I knew I was missing something from my analysis of SC questions. The Course always screamed at each and every point during the learnings that “ Please understand The meaning of the whole sentence first”. Then went back to the course and analysed (with the help of error log-cant stress the significance of this enough) that I finally was able to understand the root cause of my problem with tackling SC questions. I then focused on inculcating the meaning based approach and it immediately gave a boost to my ability. I was much more confident and was able to tackle questions with fairly high accuracy. It also reduced my overall time spent on SC questions as it made it easier for me to eliminate answer choices more easily.
My CR understanding was really bad at start. I almost dreaded and was happy when I came to know that GMAT throws the least Number of CR questions. But only after giving the mock test was I able to understand its significance. After going through the course, it gave me an idea on how to tackle such questions
1.	Always, I mean always keep the conclusion statement in your mind. If for some reason You insert your own analysis, its game over.
2.	Pre-thinking of answer choices helps a lot in understanding the direction of thought of the author. Sometimes I was able to do such questions under 30secs just because of pre-thinking.(CR questions are on the higher side of  average time taken to solve questions)
3.	Process of elimination with eliminating each point by thouroughly understanding the point is another major ability you learn as you go through the course.
RC was fairly a strong point for me so the I just brushed through the course. The thing to keep in mind is give sufficient time to fully process the entire passage (4-5 mins for large passage is good) so that questions can be tackled fairly easily. (I for some reason couldn’t get my timing right in exam which affected my overall score.)
Quant has many topics which requires sufficient time for learning all of them. The PACE AI utilized by E-Gmat is a golden hand for your preparation as it provides a very good analysis of your ability in various sections of quant and skips those which you are very good at, therby saving a lot of precious Time.
The SIGMA-X mock tests are very good at estimating your true ability and its esr like analysis provides deep insights into your strengths and weaknesses.
I also want to sincerely Thank Mr Dhruv from E-Gmat for providing constant guidance during my prep. His analysis helped me in my score improvement from 620 to 700 in just two weeks!!
Overall E-Gmat provides a very good platform for improving your ability in GMAT Exam Prep with its systematic and well designed course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","0","0","","","June 24, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi GOBI93

While the material is easy to consume and breaks down all topics you need to in great depth, it allows to students to also diagnose their strengths and weaknesses, and tailor their course in accordance. 
I found the material to cover all concepts one would need to study to crack the exam, in great depth and detail.
While I had taken the course for a last-mile push, and went through it for a rather brief(couple weeks) period of time, I saw value in cementing areas that I was fairly confident about either way aswell.
Another huge benefit of the program for me was the support one gets from the strategy experts over at E-GMAT. Rida was an absolute gem when it came to guiding me through the process and ensuring I was ably equipped to handle all that the test had to throw at me.I recommend E-Gmat to anybody who is struggling with the test.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:This course is very structured and assumes that the student has no prior knowledge of the concepts, which helps a lot, especially in verbal where as a non native speaker, I was not familiar with many concepts of the English Language.

Apart from that, this course does not go into technical terms, which is really good as the terms are hard to remember. For eg- The SC course refers to gerunds as verb-ing nouns, simplifying it for non native speakers.

Finally, the prompt support responses and the personal attention give to student make all the difference.Would make the product better:1. Faster playback option in the concept files - much needed if I am already familiar with a concept/revising a concept.
2. Revamp IR section - As IR would be a big part of the GMAT focus addition,  it needs a revamp of the IR course.Overall a great course which helped me improve my score by 90 points! The course is very well structured, explains everything in detail and builds step by step on every ability - by starting on easier level questions and moving on to tougher ones. Their strategies like maintaining an error log, had immense impact on my preparation. Initially, I did not follow these, but when I started following these strategies, it helped my verbal score a lot.

Coming to the verbal section, It has everything you could ask for. The meaning based approach in SC, the pre-thinking approach in CR and RC help a lot in solving those hard level questions, which take a lot of time and effort, in a structured manner. The small quizzes in the end of every concept helped me to cement the skills I learnt. After completing a subsection, there is a cementing process which helps in cementing the ability which I gained in the course by practicing on GMAT like questions. The level of questions in these quizzes was similar to those in the real GMAT. Helped in a lot to improve in my weaker areas, especially SC.

About the quant section, as my starting score was Q50, I was familiar with most of the concepts and the study plan recommended me to move straight to the cementing stage. The level of the questions in quant is little bit higher than the actual GMAT, which kept me grounded and not overconfident of my skills. Any concept which I was weak in I could practice and master through the concept files.

Last but not the least, the amount of personal attention and support the team provided me is the most important reason for my score improvement. I purchased the course in January and was not serious, not even completing the verbal course fully till mid April. I mailed the team about my situation and from that day onwards, they have kept no stone unturned in helping me better myself. From daily study plans to detailed mock analysis, they helped in every way possible. Special thanks to Akash from the E-GMAT team who helped me till the last night of my preparation!

Will recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their score, especially in verbal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=29#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Great course structure: Designed in a way to not overwhelm the student but at the same time that each concept is covered in detail
Amazing Analytics: Analytics help you understand the progress and identify improvement areas 
Mentorship: Great team and mentors who are truly invested in students success.My GMAT journey has been a long one with multiple break either due to family commitments, job responsibilities or my own procrastination. But along this journey one thing which was has been constant was E-Gmat’s consistence support and guidance.

Strength of EGMAT can be analysed in the following three segments:

1.	Content/Course structure: e-GMAT has very comprehensive and detailed course structure. You can be sure that you are covering every possible concept tested on Gmat. 

Course starts with basics and ends up covering even the most difficult concepts tested. Each module is thorough with ample examples to solidify the understanding. Course is divided into small modules containing concept files, application files and practice quizzes. Concept files cover the theory in detail, application files teach how to approach the questions involving those concepts and finally practice quizzes help you to test your understanding and gather feedback. 

Grammatical concepts are as important as the process to solve the question. SC/CR/RC each has its individual process to approach and solve the question which is explained beautifully in the course. How to read strategically, utilizing the sentence structure to get the most meaning out of the sentence. Pre-thinking is definitely a game changer for RC and CR. 

2.	Process and Analytics: Egmat puts a lot of emphasis on following the process. My accuracy and timing both improved dramatically once I started following the process. Initially the process takes time which often disheartens us and we want to skip the process. But with time, once the process is ingrained then you notice the true power of it. The accuracy and timing both improves, which in-turn boosts your confidence.

Scholaranium (the practice platform) helps you practice questions based upon your weakness and provides insights on improvement area. Having such granular level of insights helps you keep moving and improving. The solutions are also in great detail which helps you understand the mistakes and analyse what you missed and what needs to be improved.


3.	Mentorship: I believe this is the best feature of egmat. Mentors are tenured and take immense interest in your success. They keep you motivated and accountable. My mentor worked with me for more than 6 months, helping me improve bit by bit. She helped me create a plan towards success, analysing my performance and progress. She gave invaluable feedbacks at appropriate times and showed great faith in my potential at times when even I was not very sure about my progress.

In short, I would suggest to blindly just follow the egmat plan and path created by the team. I realized this later which did cost me plenty of time. GMAT is not about solving tons of questions but strategically learning from each question and applying the learning in subsequent questions. Honing the skill, following the process and working towards accuracy and efficiency.

I improved my score from 640 to 690 to 720 to 760 and this would not have been possible without egmats support and guidance.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","1","0","","","June 14, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear AYUSH198,   

Congratulations on the massive 120-point improvement to 760! What a score and what a journey! It has been a pleasure working through the Last Mile Push program with you toward this target.  

This mail from you after the test, spoke volumes about your joy: 

Image link: https://success.e-gmat.com/Ayush-Joy-of-Scoring-760  

The mail made my day, and I was so happy that you finally got the score that you deserved😊  

I am really glad that you found the course architecture helpful and made complete use of the concept files and application files to build a rock-solid foundation. You then mastered the processes to build a 95th percentile ability across verbal. This image shows the time spent on the Pre-thinking files helped you improve to a 92% accuracy in CR, while reducing the overall time to 1min 48 sec:  

Image link -  https://success.e-gmat.com/Ayush-Solid-Foundation-Equals-Solid-Ability  

It is commendable that despite taking longer to apply the processes at the start; you continued to apply them consistently, so that it become second nature to you. This helped reduce the time taken over time and improve accuracy.  

I am happy that the analytics on the platform helped you identify your areas of weakness which in turn helped you improve and build up a solid ability. See how this data-driven strategic approach helped you improve and maintain your RC ability at 90 + percentile: 

Image link: https://success.e-gmat.com/Ayush-RC-Accuracy

In quant too, this structured and strategic approach helped you get to Q50 in a predictable manner.  

The journey to success is rarely linear but what is needed to succeed is to stay persistent and face the obstacles and not give up on one's dreams. And this is what you did – you knew you had the potential to score big and did not give up in the face personal or professional challenges or not-so-good GMAT scores.  

Yes, there were hurdles and breaks – but you just came out stronger and the 760 is a testament to your hard work, determination and a never-say-die attitude. I am sure the score will give you a great fighting chance to get into your dream B-schools and wish you all the best for the upcoming applications and interviews.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Master comprehension section is truly a game-changer!Would make the product better:If the verbal section of the course could be adaptive, that would be even better.When I began my GMAT journey, I took the GMAT official practice mock test and scored 560 (Q46, V22), slightly less than the global average score of test-takers. I immediately knew that the Verbal section (SC & RC) is my Achilles' heel and needs significant improvement to reach the target score of 660 to be eligible for an MBA course at my target university, The University of Warwick. After spending two months learning from the GMAT Official Guidebook and GMATClub practice forum, I took another mock test once more and was surprised to improve by only 20 points to 580! At this point, I knew my learning method was not right and needed to up my game as I only had slightly more than one month left before my GMAT exam.

It was from GMATClub as well that I found e-GMAT and other courses. In the end, I decided to choose e-GMAT because of the great reviews on its verbal section. Moreover, a friend of mine, now studying for an MBA in a top UK business school, recommends I try e-GMAT. So I think nothing will go wrong and I needed to decide quickly. 

I am glad that e-GMAT taught me not only practice questions but also a great understanding of the verbal section from its Master Comprehension. Before this, I did a wrong approach to verbal questions because I never really focused on the meaning of the passage itself, but rather answered by mere instinct. Another plus point was it also improved my daily writing skill to have better clarity and structure! Unfortunately, I cannot say much about the Quantitative section because I skipped the tutorial videos and dive into practice quizzes directly. But, I think Payal and her team did a great job as the section is adaptive, an improvement I'd love to see in the Verbal section as well.

For the mock tests, I can say the Verbal section is at the same level as the official GMAT, while the Quant section seems to be more complex than the official one. Nonetheless, it is a really good practice after all and boosted my confidence significantly before the real test, in which I scored 700 (Q49, V36, IR 5, AWA 5), a 140 points improvement from my initial score! 

Overall, I highly recommend the e-GMAT to the GMAT aspirants and some tips for you to ace your test :
1. Start really, really, and really early on your GMAT preparation. At least 6 months of preparation should be ideal.
2. Begin by taking a mock test and understand where your weakness is. Be specific and honest about it, it helps!
3. Pick a course with abundant great reviews, especially a course that guides you through the process of understanding the learning materials.
4. Don't jump between sections before finishing one.
5. It's a good idea to listen to your body and take a break if you start feeling overwhelmed during practice. Enjoy the whole process - it is a marathon and not a sprint.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","1","0","","","June 10, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Lapchiong,

																			by score report","Points","Location","E-GMAT was and still is one of the highest rated courses one can find on the web and that is how I got introduced to it. For me, verbal was the weakest point, and I was looking for guidance in the same. I was very intrigued by the last mile push program which was advertised to me in the start of my preparation. 

The master comprehension course was a ray of hope for me, as it became my ground zero. Instead of worrying about what to do and what not to do, I had a starting point, which in just a few hours of preparation made me confident about myself and built up my skills. 

I used the platform for 2 months, and saw a score jump of 90 points. I went from V29 to V38, and it was all thanks to E-GMAT. I did not use the platform much for quants as I was comfortable in it, but the PACE AI found out specific topics I was weak at and gave me a chance to work on them. 

Cementing was a fun exercise, as it quantified my prep, I knew if I was going on the right track or not. Overall, the number of specifically selected questions helped me save time.

The highlight of my preparation was the mentorship and Last Mile Push program. I tried to diligently follow the E-GMAT process and trusted the process. I saw immediate results and I contacted the support to get to know about my mentor.

My mentor Akash walked with me on the journey from start till finish, he guided me what questions I should do, where should I do them from, and what should I do based on the results of it. It was really helpful.

Concluding, I would say this course is a no brainer for verbal, it will help you a lot, and you just have to trust the process and never look back!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","0","0","","","June 14, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear arnavagr,    

Congratulations on the tremendous 90-point improvement to 730! What makes the success all the sweeter is the massive verbal improvement from V29 to V38.  

From the start, you displayed the zeal to excel. Be it the time spent on the platform to build the foundation or following a structured approach to master the applications and improve ability – you left no stone unturned.  

The evidence of your hard work is clearly visible in RC, where you were able to improve and maintain a consistent 70% + accuracy for hard questions as shown in this image: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Arnav-Hard-Accuracy-in-RC  

I am really glad that Master Comprehension laid the foundation for the whole of verbal, and you were able to then learn concepts and then master application through cementing. See how this graded approach helped you excel across all sub-sections in verbal paving way to the V38: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Arnav-Excellent-Verbal-Stats-in-Scholaranium  

It is commendable that knowing that you were starting out at a higher ability in quants, you leveraged the PACE feature to selectively identify and work on your weaker areas. This ensured that you could score a Q50 in a predictable fashion.  

Arnav, it has been a pleasure working with you through the Last Mile Push program and I am happy that all your hard work paid off!  

I, on behalf of the entire e-GMAT family wish you all the best for all your future endeavours.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I have divided my review into the following categories:

1. User Interface
It took me some time (3-4 days) to get used to their interface. Some of their videos, especially Concept Videos of Sentence Correction, don’t have a “Playback Speed” option. This worked out in my favour, since I soon realised that you need to give yourself some time to register SC concepts, and watching the Concept videos (of SC) in the original speed is the best way to do that. 

2. Course Structure
They have structured all the sections of their course really well. There are easy quizzes after every concept which test your conceptual understanding at a very basic level. And after every completing every topic (eg. SC), you are advised to take Cementing Quizzes before moving to the next topic. This structure helps you cement each topic, making revision in the later stages very easy. The same structure has been used for both the sections (Quant and Verbal), just that in Quant and RC, there are a lot more quizzes within each topic. 
The question pool of EGMAT for all the sections is absolute gold. You can also select the type of ‘Question Pool’ (Correct, Incorrect, Bookmarked, Answered, Unanswered, Answered & Unanswered) for Custom Quizzes. This is really helpful in revision. Also, you can select the mode in which you want to take the quiz (Practice vs. Quiz Mode) – again, very helpful for revision.

3. Content – Verbal
Sentence Correction – The meaning-based approach used by EGMAT was really helpful. Also, the concepts were explained in the best way possible, not going into too much depth while still ensuring that you understand the concept – just what is needed for the exam! Almost all the concepts tested in my actual exam and all the mocks I took (including OG mocks) were covered properly in the course. 
CR – They suggest that you use a ‘Pre-Thinking Approach’ to solve CR questions. This approach is really helpful in the earlier stages of your prep since at that point, you have time to train your brain. Once you get used to this approach, even if you don’t pre-think, you will be able to evaluate the answer choices in a better way. I did not use the pre-thinking approach in my mocks and actual exam since you can’t spend more than 2-2.5 mins on a question but the approach definitely trained me to evaluate the answer choices more effectively.
RC – While I watched all the conceptual videos, I did not go into too much depth while preparing for this section. I relied mostly on solving questions for this section so cannot comment on their content for RC. The passages were good though, and the questions prepared me well for the exam.

4. Content – Quant
The Conceptual videos in this section (for all the topics except Word Problems – I did not watch conceptual videos on Word Problems since I was already pretty good in this topic) are very basic. Perhaps, if you are good at Quant, you don’t even need to watch all the videos, you can just download Summary PDFs available at the end of each concept and quickly go through those just to make sure that you’re not missing anything. Also, there are ‘Diagnostic Quizzes’ before every concept. These quizzes evaluate the level of your current understanding and accordingly suggest you to skip some sections, wherever possible. This saves a lot of time. 
That being said, Quant quizzes were really helpful. I would say that some questions are slightly difficult than those in the actual exam but this prepares you well for the exam. I took a lot of quizzes for Quant as well and found them to be really useful.

5. Mocks
I think that the Sigma X Mocks are an accurate indicator of your actual performance since my scores in the Sigma-X Mocks, the OG Mocks and the actual exam were pretty similar. The questions in the mocks were good as well. 

6. Last Mile Push (LMP) Program
After I scored a 760 in Sigma X Mock 2 (towards the end of April), Abha Mohan from eGMAT reached out to me. She asked me a few questions on my background and Prep. She had also gone through my performance in the eGMAT quizzes and Mock and identified a few areas of improvement. Basis this, she shared a few suggestions.
I was struggling with the timing in my mocks and her suggestions related to that really helped. She was quite proactive in identifying my areas of improvement and very honest while sharing the feedback.
I was offered this Program for free (in the beginning of May), and this program gave me a proper test schedule to follow after I was done with my preparation. The schedule was good but not something you NEED for your preparation. You can make the schedule yourself as well.
In my opinion, LMP is a good program to enrol in but only if you’re offered the program at a reasonable price.

P.S. I bought the GMAT Online Focused Course (2 months) initially but extended it 3 times (1-month extensions).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","0","0","","","June 07, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi snehilrelan,

I had completed Manhattan Book set 6th edition, OG material and GMAT Ninja Videos but was clueless on how to achieve my target score of a 770. After realizing that I was in desperate need of a mentor who could help me understand the gaps in my preparation, I landed up on the e-GMAT course and was offered a free mentorship program by them. Within the first 7 days of my enrollment, I was allotted Rashmi Vaidya as my mentor. 
This turned out to be the best decision of my entire preparation. Rashmi was to me what Ramakant Achrekar was to Sachin. She left no stone unturned in helping me reach my target. From convincing Subject Matter Experts to have one-on-one sessions with me for hours just to fill in preparation gaps, to going out of the way to get me extensions on my course, to counselling me on various occasion to keep me motivated, Rashmi was rock solid dedicated to help me achieve my dream score. I was pretty sure she would have arranged for a Mars Rover had I asked for one during my preparation. 
Although the mentorship was the best thing I could ask for, I did feel that the quality of 700+ level questions on e-GMAT especially on verbal could have been more reflective of the actual GMAT content. But I would highly vouch for the course for anyone who is on track to build basics. The entire course was well structured and all modules beautifully crafted. The products that e-GMAT has developed especially the scholaranium are awe-inspiring.

"May 29, 2023","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","My journey from 650 to 710!","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT journey began in 2021 when I started preparing using an online teaching course from a private institution. Within 5 months of preparation, I took the GMAT and scored a 650 (Q 48, V 31). I was definitely unhappy with the score and was sure that I needed to re-attempt. Post that, I tried to prepare again by myself using the available resources but due to lack of consistency and a guided approach, I never went forward with another attempt. Just when I almost gave up on GMAT, a friend who got success with eGMAT suggested that I give it one last shot. That’s when I signed up for the eGMAT (GMAT Online 360) course. 

Once I signed up, the onboarding process started. At first, I gave a SIGMA-X mock and I understood where I stand and how far I am from my goal. I was then assigned a Strategy Expert, Akash, who analyzed my entire mock and gave me a way forward about how I should start with my course. First, I prepared a customized day-by-day study plan for myself which gave me visibility and a guided approach on how much time I need to dedicate each day. I initially started with Verbal as it was my weakest area. The eGMAT Master Comprehension helped me strengthen my basics. The structured approach - Practice File, Application Files followed by the Cementing Quiz- is where eGMAT excels at. At every stage there’s a threshold for Medium and Hard difficulty which you need to clear to progress forward. In case you fail to follow that, the strategy expert is just an email away and will share an improvement plan for you based on where you stand. There’s a similar approach for Quant as well. The eGMAT P.A.C.E module helps you save significant time with Quant and helps you focus on your weaker areas. After almost 4 months of prep, I took the GMAT and scored a 710 (Q49, V36)!

Here’s are some aspects of eGMAT that helped me:

1) Dedicated strategy expert: Akash, my strategy expert was more like that one person who helped me understand where I faltered and what I needed to focus on. Analyzing my mocks was one thing I was amiss and he was available to analyze each mock and suggest areas of focus and improvement. 

2) Sigma-X mocks: The post analysis that these mocks provide is very similar to how your ESR would look like. It gave me an idea which quartile was bad for me, helped me figure out where I took the most time and how was the progression during my mock. This actually gave me visibility on what I need to focus on in my next mock and areas of improvement too. 

3) eGMAT Scholaranium: The collection of questions for each subsection, the quality of questions and the level of each question - all of this together especially for Verbal stands apart and gives you ample of questions to practice, review, and replay questions. You can also create custom quizzes to focus on weaker topics and also get topic wise breakdown of your performance. 

4) The eGMAT approach: The sentence structure approach for SC, the pre-thinking approach for CR or strategies such as keyword and predictive approach for RC - you might consider it time consuming but as you keep on practicing it becomes a part of your approach while solving questions and makes the approach very structured. 

Overall, the eGMAT course is definitely a course one should look at incase you’re struggling with your prep (especially Verbal) and need a guided approach. However, it does demand consistency and applying whatever you learn to get the desired results. I would suggest that you don't rush through the course and give it enough time during your prep journey and only when you’re confident about a particular subsection, move forward to the next. I expected my prep would end in 2 months since it was a re-attempt but I finished it in 4 months. It will be frustrating at times, but hold on to it and don’t give up, and you won’t be disappointed. And one last piece of advice: please maintain an Error Log, it definitely helps!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","0","0","","","June 01, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear mihirhmehta,

No suggestions from my side on how to improve it further.I, a 23-year-old student from Germany, am excited to share my GMAT journey. In the final stage of my test preparation, I enrolled in e-GMAT's GMAT Online 360 course, which proved to be a game-changer. Upon purchasing the course on May 6, 2023, I acquired two months of access to their extensive resources. With e-GMAT's help, my first attempt score of 620 (Q48, V27) significantly improved to 690 (Q49, V35, AWA 6, IR 5) within just 18 days between attempts. Starting in January with a raw score of 540, I studied intermittently for the GMAT for about 3–4 months, with a one-month gap due to university exams and a critical medical condition. Despite a lack of sleep and test anxiety during my first attempt on May 4, I stayed determined to enhance my verbal skills. By dedicating 9–10 hours daily for around 15 days, I was able to achieve a 690 score. I am immensely grateful to e-GMAT for providing invaluable guidance throughout my preparation. My mentor, Dhruv, guided my efforts in the best direction, allowing me to draw upon the limited time available and maximize my efforts.

I found e-GMAT's meaning-based approach and pre-thinking framework to be particularly valuable in addressing complex Sentence Correction (SC) and Critical Reasoning (CR) questions. Thanks to e-GMAT's guidance, my accuracy in SC improved significantly, and I gained confidence in tackling challenging CR questions. The application files and practice files provided after the concept files were instrumental in helping me apply the appropriate approach to each question type. These resources, among many others, were immensely beneficial in my preparation journey.

The Cementing phase played a pivotal role in my verbal preparation. Solving several cementing quizzes and reviewing my solutions in depth allowed me to internalize problem-solving approaches effectively. The invaluable insights I gained about my strengths and weaknesses in specific sections allowed me to refine my study plan and seize the ""low-hanging fruits`"". At the same time, I efficiently allocated enough mental energy towards enhancing other areas.
I must stress the immense influence of my dedicated mentor, Dhruv, who has been with me since day one. In the beginning, Dhruv crafted a personalized study plan designed to optimize my progress within the limited 18-day timeframe. Recognizing both the time constraints and my abilities, Dhruv meticulously devised study plans for each of the three verbal sections and adapted them according to my requirements. Thanks to Dhruv's guidance, I was able to effectively maximize my learning outcomes.

For aspiring GMAT test-takers, I would like to share a few tips based on my personal experience. Firstly, establish a consistent study routine and adhere to it diligently. Recognize the immense value of consistency in internalizing the various approaches to the GMAT's diverse question types. Secondly, engage in regular practice using trustworthy resources like e-GMAT's Scholaranium, focusing on quality rather than quantity. Particularly in the verbal section, understanding why incorrect answers are wrong and why the correct ones are right is crucial. Hence, it is pivotal to review and analyse not only the incorrect questions but also those that took longer to answer or required guessing. Finally, implement the e-GMAT's meaning-based approach and pre-thinking framework, as they can substantially improve your accuracy and, over time, speed, and adhere to the e-GMAT’s 3-step process — Concept files, Cementing, and Test-readiness — a sound and reliable process that aids you in mastering the underlying abilities required for scoring well in the GMAT.

To sum up, e-GMAT’s online 360 course provided me with a unique learning experience. Through their 3-step process, comprehensive study materials, and invaluable mentorship from Dhruv, I was able to achieve my target score within a remarkably short timeframe. The meaning-based approach and pre-thinking framework were instrumental in helping me improve my accuracy. Moreover, the invaluable insights provided by Scholaranium analytics and personalized mentoring from Dhruv accelerated my progress substantially. I highly recommend e-GMAT to GMAT aspirants seeking a comprehensive and tailored learning path to reach their target scores.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=30#","1","0","","","June 02, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi VYOMINCAPS

The reason I wanted to share a quick summary of my journey before sharing a review is that, GMAT is a test of many aspects - Perseverance, Time management, concepts, practice... I think E-GMAT approaches the test in a holistic manner as it should, and helps you improve.
It has a very thoughtful concept learning platform and utilizes data in a very efficient manner. For example, E-GMAT uses something called a cementing technique – You go through their courses, cement that particular section using their cementing quizzes and then move onto the next section. You can keep solving a few questions once in every 3-4 days so that you don’t lose touch. 
Their Sigma X mocks are quite accurate in judging your ability – I’d suggest aspirants don’t waste them!
And of course there’s this unique mentor support! – You get assigned a mentor who’ll check on your progress and also suggest improvement plans.
Coming back to my story, Akash gave me a study plan which I followed rigorously, and in about a month and a half, I could feel the difference in my ability. I was able to identify the incorrect options more confidently and I was also able to manage my time better...
I finally gave my GMAT on the 28th of Apr-23 and scored a 710 (V37 Q49). I think E-GMAT not only helped me with the concepts but also with the motivation levels (Trust me, this is very important). The process may seem cumbersome at the beginning but it will definitely yield results once you get enough practice. 
I'm giving another attempt to get to that 750+ level and I'm sure E-GMAT will play a big part in this Journey of mine as well!
Kudos to the team for creating a well-crafted study platform and an ethos of learning!

Over a year ago, I attempted to conquer the GMAT in just two weeks with the help of E-GMAT. However, this approach proved to be ineffective, resulting in a disappointing score of 620 (Q48, V27). It became apparent to me that I had underestimated the complexity of the exam.

One year later, when I made the decision to apply to business school, I approached the GMAT differently. This time, I dedicated myself to preparing for the exam with E-GMAT, adopting a more diligent and structured approach. This decision turned out to be a game-changer. After approximately three months of studying around 20 hours per week, I was able to significantly improve my score to a commendable 710 (Q49, V39)!

There were three standout aspects of E-GMAT that played a crucial role in my preparation:

- Personalized Approach: E-GMAT's personalized approach was instrumental in my success. They recognized my strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to save time and effort by focusing on the areas that needed the most improvement.

- Mentorship: E-GMAT's mentors were invaluable as my guiding lights. Not only were they subject matter experts, but they also provided unwavering support and motivation throughout my journey. Their personalized feedback and guidance kept me on track and instilled a healthy sense of pressure, ensuring that I reached my target score within the estimated time frame.

- Sigma X Mocks: The mock exams provided by E-GMAT closely resembled the real GMAT. Practicing with these mocks and thoroughly analyzing them proved to be immensely beneficial in pushing my score beyond the coveted 700 threshold.

In conclusion, I highly recommend E-GMAT to any aspiring GMAT test-taker. It is the most effective and time-efficient way to prepare for the exam. However, it is essential not to underestimate the dedication and effort the GMAT demands, as I did in my first attempt. By embracing E-GMAT's structured approach and combining it with determination, you can pave the path to success.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=31#","1","1","","","May 25, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear FacuAgui,

With my test scheduled for May 3rd, I knew I had limited time to make significant improvements. Thankfully, I discovered e-GMAT and their exceptional team, which played a crucial role in my success. I want to give credit to e-GMAT for helping me achieve a remarkable score improvement of 220 points, from my initial mock test to my final GMAT score of 700.

As a first-time test-taker with no prior experience in entrance exams, e-GMAT proved to be an invaluable resource. The verbal content they offer stands out as the best available on the internet.

Beyond their comprehensive content, what impressed me most about e-GMAT was the personalized attention they provided to every student. GMAT preparation can be mentally exhausting, and there are times when you need someone to give you a push. I experienced a period of extreme demotivation and confusion during my preparation. In a moment of desperation, I decided to reach out to the e-GMAT team via email. To my surprise, within a few hours, I received a response with a personalized plan and motivating words that cleared all my confusion and served as a turning point in my preparation. The team encouraged me to follow up once I had completed the suggested plan, emphasizing their commitment to individual student progress. I wholeheartedly recommend e-GMAT to anyone planning to take the GMAT. Don't hesitate to reach out for support and guidance, as it will undoubtedly add value to your preparation.

One piece of advice I would offer to those with no experience in entrance tests is to allocate sufficient time for preparation. Rushing through the process with the pressure of limited time can be your worst enemy. Additionally, be aware that the test-taking conditions on the actual exam day can differ significantly from the mocks you take at home.

The feature of the course that I liked the most was profoundly deep explanations for every concept that enabled me to understand as many details as possible. Moreover, e-GMAT experts always responded to my questions within a day. Scholaranium is a great tool to practice by creating question sets. When I finished learning concepts and practicing them, I was contacted by Rida, Senior Consultant at e-GMAT, who designed a review strategy for me to get ready for the test. After reviewing, I took three mocks and scored 750, 730, 760.

On 29 April 2022, I took my final exam – and scored 760! So, I improved my quant score by 8 points and my verbal – by 28 points. For sure, I couldn’t imagine such a strong improvement when I started my GMAT preparation, but hard work and dedication led me to decent results. 

I wanted to say a big thank you to the e-GMAT team and especially to Rida for guiding me!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=31#","2","0","","","May 19, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi stas0nchik,

5. Strategies to figure out and tackle CR question typeWould make the product better:1. The quality of type of questions in Quant mock tests can be improved to make it closer to official GMAT questions.I started my GMAT journey with no background and tried to navigate on my own. After a couple months of preparing from different websites in a very unstructured way, I scored 650. To improve my score, one of my seniors suggested me e-GMAT. I took a free lesson of Sentence correction and it was an eye opener to me. I trusted e-GMAT as the single source of prep (along with GMAT official mocks) and scored 740 (target score I submitted during e-GMAT registration). I would strongly recommend this course for every GMAT aspirant (irrespective of his/her journey stage) for below reasons:
1.	PACE methodology : I had 3 months for my next attempt and I wanted to make sure that I focus only on my weak parts and PACE helped me A LOT. It helped me skip the contents where I had a good command by testing me on various difficulty levels and helped to give more time where needed.
2.	Verbal content : The content of Verbal course, especially SC and CR, is really good. I was able to figure out my right weakness using error analysis sheets and made sure I never repeat those mistakes. Once I did this, I could see a huge difference in the e-GMAT sectional tests which replicated in e-GMAT and official mocks
3.	Forum Discussions : I learnt a lot through the discussions forum of every questions. It increased my capacity to look questions from a different perspective or other possible ways which I could have taken and probably would have marked the incorrect answer. This helped me a lot in the negation approach of tackling a question.
4.	In depth videos and cementing :  Last but not the least, the videos on every topic is very relevant and cover crucial topics in depth with an interesting pedagogy. The concept of cementing really helped me in assessing my understanding and work on my weaknesses accordingly.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=31#","0","0","","","May 10, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Teddy777,

It is commendable that early into your preparation, you were able to identify the need for a structured approach and took the necessary steps toward this including testing out the trial version before finalizing the course.  

I am impressed by how you leveraged the PACE time-saving feature to selectively address just your weak areas in quant. I can see that through this approach, you were able to save over 16 hours in your quant study. In Algebra alone you were able to save over 10 hours as seen in this image:

As an engineer, I had previously neglected my quant skills and focused primarily on the verbal section. However, after taking E-GMAT, I can confidently say that this course is the gold standard for GMAT preparation.

The sentence correction section in particular stands out as the most exceptional I have come across. I have tried various sources, but none can compare to the quality and depth of E-GMAT's solutions. The detailed explanations are approximately 13 minutes long and allow students to thoroughly comprehend each question. Additionally, the forum review component adds another layer of learning, enabling students to view questions from multiple perspectives and identify mistakes they may have missed. The prompt response by the mentors is another significant advantage of E-GMAT.

The scholaranium section is where the true value of this course is revealed. It helps students identify their weaknesses and provides insights on the aspects they need to improve on. Sometimes we misinterpret our weaknesses due to time constraints, but the medium and hard cementing quizzes in scholaranium provide an excellent opportunity for students to challenge themselves and fine-tune their skills.

I wholeheartedly recommend E-GMAT to anyone looking to excel on the GMAT. The course and mock tests are on par with the actual GMAT, and the benefits are immeasurable.

The course is very interactive with the pre-quiz to gauge your current knowledge on the topic and then the lesson followed by the post-quiz. The PACE AI was really helpful for quants as it allowed me to skip lessons in which we already have a good hold. Scholaranium was great for practice and the level of questions in it and the Sigma-X mocks were representative of the actual GMAT. The analytics was really insightful and allowed me to target my weaknesses and focus on what’s important.I started my GMAT preparation in the first week of August 2022 and soon realized that there was just too much information available on the internet. I needed a structured course and purchased the e-GMAT course on a friend’s recommendation. As I had my GMAT scheduled in mid-October, I quickly went through the course without really going according to the plan. I scored 630 (V31, Q45). I knew I could score better so after returning dejected from the test centre I decided to mail the e-GMAT team. They were really quick to respond and Dhruv was assigned as my mentor. He went through my ESR and laid out a detailed step-by-step improvement plan starting with SC. The meaning-based approach helped a lot here. I was also told to make an error log which also helped me track my mistakes and understand the pattern of mistakes I was making. After I was done with my SC improvement, I was given another detailed plan for CR. Pre-thinking was a game changer in CR as it gave me a direction on how to go about answering CR problems. I was able to solve hard questions with ease with the help of the pre-thinking technique. After CR improvement we went ahead with similar plans for RC followed by Verbal test readiness and Quants. The analytics page especially in Quants was really valuable for me as I was able to target my weaknesses and this allowed me to devote more time to Verbal. The level of questions in the Sigma-X mocks was also great and representative of the actual GMAT and the scores I got in these mocks were also close to my actual GMAT score. I gave another attempt in January and scored 710 this time (V39, Q49).

It takes an enormous amount of effort and extreme diligence to achieve an 80-point improvement, and you demonstrated both qualities as you progressed from a score of 630 (Q45, V31) to 710 (Q49, V38). 

Your impressive improvement in Sentence Correction (SC) is notable and deserves recognition.

Your Verbal score underwent a remarkable improvement of 7 points, which can be attributed to your adoption of the Meaning-based approach for Sentence Correction (SC) and the Pre-thinking approach for Critical Reasoning (CR). These two strategies were the key factors that enhanced your Verbal score, elevating it from a V31 (59th Percentile) to an outstanding V38 (89th Percentile). Here is an image that serves as evidence of your exceptional Verbal ability achieved during the final phase of your preparation journey.

																			by score report","","Location","Strengths:It is very comprehensive and covers each concept in great detail. AI helps extract most out of the questions.I initially started preparing for GMAT from the Official Guides. However, it took me only a short time to realize this strategy wasn't right. I needed more than the concepts in the guide before the questions to solidify my preparation for the exam. Hence, I started navigating the internet to select an appropriate course. I came across excellent reviews for e-gmat on websites such as Quora, Reddit, and GMAT Club. A lot of people said that the verbal course is ideal for non-natives. I decided to opt for the 'GMAT online 360' course in e-gmat.

I was amazed by the depth of the content for each part of the test. Every topic was discussed in great detail, covering all possible ways the test maker may test that concept. To minimize the time spent, the modules in SC had pre-assessment quizzes s that one could go through the files accordingly. Post-assessment quizzes tested how much one had learned through the file. RC strategies were beneficial. The quant part was extensive; if one diligently follows their course, one can easily crack GMAT quant. 

Cementing process was one of the most impressive parts of the course. It ensured that the concepts were solidified. Additionally, it helped me get comfortable with the hard questions required to score high in every section.

AI and data analytics helped me identify my weak areas to work upon. We could identify the questions that took us longer than the median time. Analysis of such questions was a great opportunity for improvement.

The subject matter experts were extremely helpful. Each doubt was cleared within 24 hours. Their intent wasn't just to solve the immediate doubt but to identify why the student had that confusion and to recommend suitable courses of action to bridge the gap in understanding.

Strategy experts were exceptionally helpful at every step of the preparation. Whenever I hit any roadblock, they would guide me. As a part of the Last Mile Program, I received direct support from Rida. She was an outstanding mentor. Not only did she help me analyze my mocks in the right direction, but she was also a constant source of support. I would contact her after each mock, and she used to help me with the corrective actions. The study plans made by her allowed me to practice a disciplined approach to the exams. You could feel the level of commitment from each of the e-gmat mentors.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:SC section is really good.
Scholaranium feature is also a very good practice portal.
All the contents are very well structured.Would make the product better:There are some improvement rooms for e-GMAT, and I will be honest about this.
1. Forum response: I found quite a number of ""not so good"" responses in the forum. I think the experts can do better in answering the students' queries.
2. The error log: I think the Scholaranium is a good tool, but it can be better if it has an error log built in. I think it is not a complex feature to build. Rather than having students documenting stuffs on excel sheets, having a built in or automated error log will help a lot.
3. For Quant part, it would be better if more application questions are illustrated explicitly.I have been studying with e-GMAT for around 4 months before I got the latest 710 GMAT score.

I first took a mock test and got 650 score. After 2 months, I finished Verbal section and took my first GMAT test in Feb 23 and got 700. Then, I joined the Last Mile Push (LMP) program from e-GMAT and took another test in Apr 23 and got 710.

Before breaking down into each parts, my overall impressions to e-GMAT are:
1. The courses are well-structured. The content are taught in a good sequence. The topics are broken down in a good way, so I can see the big picture of what I need to learn and how important each topic is.
2. The forum posting/commenting in every questions or contents. When you have any doubts, you can always post in the forum and the experts will answer you in 1 day. I used this feature a lot and most of the time my doubt was clarified.
3. The Scholaranium portal is a very good and convenient tool. It is a question bank where you can do practice quizzes or mock tests on the platform itself. The platform collects the statistic and provide valuable insights regarding your performance. Your mentor can really see how you perform and provide on-point feedbacks.

My feedback towards Verbal:
1. SC is really great. The content are provided in the way that you can see how SC questions can be. The meaning-based approach is honestly a pretty simple but very powerful technique. The way of thinking e-GMAT that teaches you is very structured and practical.
2. For CR, the general conceptual knowledge about CR is well taught. The approach is practical as well. However, I think some logics from e-GMAT original questions are a bit off for a few questions. There is nothing as good as OG questions when it comes to CR part I think, but e-GMAT is doing quite okay for me though.
3. For RC, I think the reading strategy taught by e-GMAT works for me, but it might not work for everyone. The more you read and practice, the more you excel in RC. The reading strategy is just another way of cracking this type of question.

For Quant part:
1. I think the general knowledge are taught well. The concepts are quite strong in my opinion.
2. However, I think the content lacks application aspects a bit. There are a lot of question types in Quant. One topic, let's say divisibility, can be twisted into many many types of questions. Knowing the concept helps you to be able to solve the question, but mastering how to apply the concept helps you to be able to solve the question in time and in a easier manner.
3. The solution provided are sometimes not realistic and practical for GMAT exam.

Last Mile Push (LMP)
1. I think this program helped me a lot. You will be assigned a mentor who will plan things out for you, analyze your performances and come up with a corrective action, provide suggestions in terms of testing preparation, and talk to you over all other aspects of GMAT.
2. My mentor closely worked with me. She first planned out the schedule for me, but I failed it by getting a lot behind the plan. She then adjusted and tried to make the best alternatives for me according to the situation and limited time. In short, the mentor worked with me closely and kept adjusting things based on the real situation. It is always better to work with someone rather than to work alone towards the same goal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=32#","0","0","","","May 04, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi oattp,

Below is my honest review about the course.

In the verbal concept building phase, the questions discussed are too easy. There is a sudden increase in difficulty and complexity when you start with practice. The answer explanation is not upto the mark and I had to refer to gmatclub discussion many a times. For any particular question, there is an entire discussion thread that one must sift through to check whether anyone else had the same confusion as you did. If yes, great! If no, then you ask the question and wait for an unsatisfactory answer. (Exception: Answers by Harshendra are great!) The discussion thread contains a lot of stale answers as well. So, beware of going through an inaccurate explanation.

In quant section, there is no complaint.

Overall, the course did help me develop my basics. I have a better grip on the individual concepts. I faltered in the application phase, but that's my issue. Maybe it will work out nicely for you.

SIGma-X mocks are the key strengths of this product.Would make the product better:1. Though they provide query support, which normally takes a day to receive a response from the instructor, holding live biweekly or weekly doubt clearing sessions where students may get their confusions or doubts clarified right away will save a lot of time and mind space during this journey. 
2. Easily accessible Crisp summaries, summarized charts of a few essential sentence structures, key idioms or important phrases, formulas, and short tips and tactics that must be memorized would substantially assist students in revising the key points in the last minutes.The entire course is well-structured, easy to follow, and provides enough questions to learn, practice and strengthen the fundamentals. Finally the course provides 5 Mock tests which help assess our preparation and take corrective measures on time. In the process of learning, primarily I developed a new skill-set, whereas a score of 700 became a fruitful byproduct.

It is worthwhile to invest in the course provided by EGMAT. In my opinion, if we solve the material provided by egmat in the time allotted, we won't need any more material to pass the GMAT with a good score.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi,

 I took the GMAT course from the e-gmat  and improved my score by 160 points. The course is very interactive and self-paced. As a working professional, It is very easy for me to grasp concepts in this interactive course. In addition, each section in the course has different modules/concepts and hence it helps us better understand our weaknesses and focus on correcting our mistakes.

The methods learned in this course especially in verbal helps you to solve questions even in a stressed environment as in the test center. The pre-thinking approach and the meaning based approach in verbal helped me a lot to improve my verbal score. The mocks in this course very much stimulate the actual GMAT mocks . In fact, they are a bit tougher when compared to actual GMAT. One can expect to score a greater than or equal to the score we got in e-gmat mocks.

The one thing that worked very well for me other than the course is the mentorship programme. GMAT is not just a test of concepts but it’s also a test of resilience, consistency and calmness. We might get a good score over the mocks but screw up our actual exam if we do not maintain our calmness. My mentor, Rashmi, from e-gmat provided me with the much needed confidence and boost along with detailed study plan throughout my journey keeping in view of my weakness and strengths. Thanks a lot to the e-gmat team, especially Rashmi, for being there throughout the journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=32#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on your 700😊! A 160-point improvement is no mean feat, and it has been my pleasure working with you in this journey.  

As you have rightly said - “GMAT is not just a test of concepts but it’s also a test of resilience, consistency and calmness.” I am glad that you displayed all these characteristics in this journey to your target score.  

Since you were starting out at a lower ability in both verbal and quant, you set about building your ability from the foundation up by learning concepts and applications and then practicing then on GMAT-like questions in cementing.  

This image shows how the near-perfect scores in SC foundational concepts helped you improve to a 65%+ accuracy across all blocks: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Mounica-SC-Accuracy-across-Blocks  

In CR too, you were able to improve to a 76% accuracy while reducing the overall time by working on your areas of weakness and internalizing the pre-thinking approach. This image charts the improvement in accuracy the Assumptions block in CR against the reduction in the overall time:

In GMAT preparation, the means to predict your ability and outcome is a great asset. I am really happy that the SIGma-X mocks enabled you to predict your outcome enabling you to take the right steps toward your success.  

There are always ups and downs in any journey and I am glad that you never gave up despite the downs and with the “resilience, consistency and calm” were able to overcome this and get to your dream score😊 I am sure these qualities that you have displayed during your preparation will help you succeed in your future endeavours too.  

I, on behalf of the entire e-GMAT family, wish you all the very best.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1 - Adaptive Pacing - Especially in Quant, the adaptive pacing helps the student skim over the topics he/she is comfortable with and spend appropriate time on topics one is struggling with.

2 - Assigned mentor - Once a student is done with the learning phase of the course, a mentor is assigned to him/her. this is especially useful as the mentor can optimize the student's time and ensure that he/she is not wasting time on irrelevant stuff.

3- the Scholaranium - this is the question bank of E-gmat and I can't emphasize enough on its importance. it is very well designed and closely resembles the questions on the actual GMAT. The Question bank has enough questions to practice, provided one judiciously uses it and doesn't squander it. the Mentor can really help the student here.Would make the product better:1 - Completely self-driven - I would want a bit more initiative from the team during the revision / strategizing phase. The team is always quick to respond to mails and texts, no complaints there, but I feel a bit more initiative from the team will go a long way.I enjoyed my time with the E-gmat. I opted for a 2-month course with a one-month extension. I initially gave my gmat with 2-month prep and scored 700. Before this, I did not take any coaching from any other platform and stuck to GMAT club practice questions for practice and Manhattan for the concept. I scored a 700 with this and decided to opt for a re-test along with an e-gmat subscription. 
This decision proved helpful. In the verbal section, I could gauge my improvement and keep tabs on the concepts I was faltering in. Their mentorship program also helped me identify key areas where I was lacking, on which I diligently worked. I was especially fumbling in CR initially, but the structure-driven approach helped bolster the concept for me.
their difficulty Quant coursework is a notch higher in difficulty when compared to the GMAT, which makes the Quant section a breeze in the actual exam.
their mocks too are an apt representation of the level of questions one will face in the actual gmst and they help in the process of preparation for the same. I was scoring around 730 in their Mocks and was quite happy with myself. But in the actual exam, I got 710 (owing to some personal issues I was going through on my end)
Overall, I am quite happy with the E-gmat coursework and its mentorship program. They make sure one is comfortable with the process and ensure that every need of the student is met in a timely manner.

3. And the most important, it's LMP (Last Mile Push) programI enrolled with E-GMAT in November 2022 after my 4th GMAT attempt. I had scored a 620 in my 4th attempt and was extremely disheartened  as the score was not representative of all the hard work I had put in over the past few months. Quite frustrated with the whole situation, I took the first e-gmat sigma mock 2 days after my 4th attempt and scored a 690. I had heard from my friends that e-gmat sigma mocks are a reliable predictor of your current gmat ability. After seeing the 690 score, I quickly signed up for the e-gmat online 360 (which includes both verbal and quant prep) and was amazed at the brilliance of questions and their solutions. Since I had already solved a lot of OG questions, I felt that the Scholaranium questions truly match up to the level of OG questions. After working for about a month on the egmat course, I reached out to their support team for enrollment to the LMP program. Since LMP is an invite only program and is offered to only few students, I was pleasantly surprised when Rida Shafeek responded to my request. Rida analysed my previous ESRs in detail and was ready to enroll me under her mentorship. She chalked out a comprehensive improvement plan based on my strengths and weaknesses, recommended some amazing test taking strategies and helped me push my score from 620 to 710 (Q49 V38 IR8).

 E-GMAT offers personalized study plans that are tailored to each student's strengths and weaknesses. The plan we constructed helped me extensively in managing my time alongside my engineering studies and allowed me to achieve my target score.
In order to master the verbal section of the GMAT exam, the e-GMAT course provided me with the concept of meaning-based learning, which emphasizes understanding the meaning of sentences and paragraphs. This approach is particularly helpful for non-native English speakers such as myself who may struggle with the language.
Additionally, the quantitative section material is built in a way to aid the students fill their conceptual gaps and build knowledge from the ground up if necessary. Starting from the basics, The e-GMAT Quant section material delivers a series of Concept Files, which cover all the fundamental concepts tested on the GMAT. These Concept Files are designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of each concept, and they include examples and practice questions to help students apply what they have learned. E-GMAT also provides practice quizzes for each section of the Quant material, allowing students to test their skills and identify areas where they need more practice.

Students can choose to practice specific areas or topics that they are struggling with, or take full-length practice tests to simulate the GMAT test experience. You also have access to 5 full-length Mock exams which are extremely helpful in your preparation. These mock tests helped me track my progress and test myself prior to taking the official GMAT exam.

EGMAT is a strong GMAT prep solution with exceptional sentence correction and quant courses. However, to become a well-rounded solution for GMAT preparation, EGMAT needs to improve its reading comprehension and critical reasoning courses significantly. By doing so, EGMAT can offer a more comprehensive and effective solution for students seeking to improve their scores on the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=33#","0","0","","","April 06, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear blackpanther911,

I wasn't sure about taking an online course, and I was also a bit put off by the fact that there was no option to skip verbal videos. However, looking back now, I'm so glad that I took the leap and enrolled in the course. As it turned out, watching the verbal videos was incredibly helpful in building my foundation, and I'm convinced that it played a significant role in my score improvement.

While the course was video-based and didn't have any live instructors, the support that I received from the e-GMAT team was incredible. I had a few questions along the way, and I was always able to get in touch with someone who was knowledgeable and responsive. I want to give a special shoutout to Dhruv Joshi, who was particularly helpful in answering my questions and providing guidance throughout my preparation.

Prior to taking the e-GMAT course, I was quite disappointed with my first GMAT attempt, which resulted in a score of 640. However, thanks to the course's comprehensive content and effective teaching methods, I was able to improve my score by a whopping 60 points. My latest GMAT score is 700 (Q49, V36), which was a huge relief and has given me the confidence to pursue my MBA goals.

Overall, I would highly recommend e-GMAT's GMAT Online 360 course to anyone looking to improve their GMAT score. While I was initially hesitant, I'm so glad that I decided to take the course. The support from the e-GMAT team was invaluable, and the course itself was instrumental in my score improvement.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=33#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

2. Sufficient depth and sectional focus for good scoreWould make the product better:Not muchI used the E-Gmat portal for just a month and ten days. Firstly, I am very confident that if I would have used for another month, I would easily have cracked above 760.
Verbal:
Sentence Correction: I only attended a webinar by Ms. Payal Tandon and if not more atleast sixty pc of job related to SC was done. She taught how to just go with the meaning. This put the intensive grammar at the back foot and allowed me to focus on real issue. I did do the portal's grammar lessons but meaning based approach was most important.  Frankly, I didn't have any time to give a mock test. In the exam, I just attempted with the meaning.

CR: They give sufficient practice with the help of lessons. 

RC: E-Gmat's lessons revolved around basic reading skills and this is what is required for RC. The lesson taught me how to pause and summarize at the right time. I was already an avid reader and I just needed this training to attempt objective content of GMAT.

Quant: Sufficient practise is required for quant even though one is an engineer. Here also I did not have enough time to attempt all the lessons. But managed to get 88percentile

Overall, the portal has excellent other techniques to improve score and that would have easily helped to cross 760.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=33#","0","0","","","March 30, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi khandelwalsidd,

Their Support team is very resourcefulWould make the product better:The verbal section needs AI.
Support team can be proactive in asking if their students have difficulties
I didnt talk to the support team until i had severe difficulties.I would've probably done the prep faster if the support team were in constant touch with me since the very start instead of waiting for me to ask for help

The links that are sent to Us when we ask for help should be readily available in our dashboard 
ie- for trouble in Verbal watch this video on visualisation by harsha
It will help a lot of studentsI had a score improvement of 130 points.
I went from being super weak in verbal from v22 to v35 
The main USP is the help/support 
I suggest everyone to be in constant touch with the egmat support team.Talk to them atleast once a week and ask them for tips and vids to improve
ask them for help they are the best out there.
I was struggling with everything in verbal
I reached out to the support team in desperation they sent links to videos which helped me a lot.

All i want to say to people reading this is
Make sure you give yourself adequate time for prep
I thought i would complete my prep in 2 months but actually felt like i was never prepared
Finally even though i still felt like i needed more time 
I just booked a date and gave the exam

You dont need to be perfect at the first try
Please dont think the way i did
I thought i will first perfect myself and then book the exam date.This led me to go in to a downward spiral where i was  prepping  day in and day out without any foreseeable date.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. The online platform built by e-GMAT which helps you assess you strengths and weaknesses with respect to sub-topics, difficulty level and timing.
2. The dedicated support through mentors (part of the Last Mile Program only) who chart out a prep plan allocating time to be spent on learning concepts and solving questions.Would make the product better:1. The Quant problem banks have some unnecessarily difficult questions. These are beyond what is tested by the GMAT.
2. The Last Mile Program and the terms and conditions should be described clearly during the first introduction call. They are brought into the picture only after the test taker has purchased and enrolled into the course.I gave my final GMAT attempt on 4th March 2023 and scored a 740 (Q49, V42). This was my second attempt, less than three weeks after my initial attempt (690 - Q48, V37) on 13th Feb 2023. In between both attempts, I signed up for e-GMAT's $149 course. 

I first came to know of e-GMAT through their Youtube channel when I was watching their Sentence Correction videos on the Meaning-based Approach. I liked their approach because it felt quite natural and relatable to how I had approached SC questions when I had attempted them without any preparation. Most importantly, it took the focus away from Grammar rules, at least partially, which I had dreaded from the time I was in middle school. After my first attempt, I felt that I needed professional help to identify and address my weaknesses in a pin-pointed manner but in a short amount of time. After my introductory call with Mansi from e-GMAT, I was convinced that they would be able to help me in the hyper-customized fashion that I was looking for. 
Based on my ESR from the first attempt and a few diagnostic quizzes I took over a week during the evenings, the strategy expert from e-GMAT, Rida, helped me with a day-wise plan to address my weaknesses. Within 3-4 days, we were able to cover most of the topics and were ready to re-evaluate my test-readiness through a Sigma-X mock. While my overall performance on the mock was not as expected, it did give me confidence on some of the topics I had worked upon during the preceding week. Eventually, during my second attempt, just 12 days since my journey with e-GMAT started, I was able to apply the learnings from the concepts, practice questions and mock that e-GMAT provided to land on a score I was glad to accept.

The concepts that were instrumental to boost my confidence were around Sentence Correction - Comparisons and Modifiers. The deep-dives into topics like As vs Like were extremely helpful. I was also able to brush up my concepts of Geometry and Inequalities as it had been a while since I had put them to use. While I do feel that the phase-wise prep style at e-GMAT is extremely helpful as a comprehensive prep strategy, what worked for my time-sensitive use-case was the analytics-driven approach to identify my weaknesses across topics, difficulty level of questions and the time taken to solve questions. 

I would definitely recommend e-GMAT to test-takers who are at a stage where I was when I approached them, i.e., if you are scoring 650+ and need the help of tools and a professional to pin-point your weaknesses and work on them to achieve a 700+ score. I’m sure e-GMAT has a lot more to offer to a lot more people, but in my limited interaction of 12 days, they were able to help me in a time-sensitive hyper-customized manner. The motivation that Rida, my strategy expert sent my way was the icing on the cake.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=33#","0","0","","","March 28, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey Glancer97, 

Congrats on GMAT 740!! 

Thank you so much for taking the time to write your review! This is Rida, your mentor- it was a real pleasure working with you on your journey to your target score! 

Your dedication to giving it your all in the two weeks that we worked together was evident in your prompt completion of milestones and the way you utilised the course to tackle certain areas where you required additional support. This is most evident in SC where you improved your accuracy to 76%.

Since we were working on an extremely limited time frame, every step had to be precise and to the point, so that not a minute of study time was mis utilised. Thus, for each day, you had extremely clear plans as to what needed to be tackled, what improvement you needed to see, what scores you needed to achieve and more. And you made sure to follow these steps to the letter and trust the process. 

I admire your drive and confidence- even when you didn’t get the best score on your last mock, you still believed in your abilities and did your best to learn from the experience, rather than let it bring you down. 

Thank you for your feedback regarding the quant questions – we believe that preparing for the GMAT is like preparing for war and there is no such thing as over preparation. As for the Last Mile Program- it is something that we discuss often on our YouTube channel but is meant for students in the last stages of their prep who have gone through the course. Your unique situation and starting score where what allowed you to join the program from the get-go.

I know that you were willing to put in all the effort to get to your target score. Just looking at the snapshot below- you gave it your 100% in the SC modules, so you could perfect the concepts that would enable success.

The reason why we explain in such detail is so that non-native speakers and people who are not as familiar with the intricacies of the English language can acquire all the knowledge, they need to ace the Verbal section of the GMAT. 

I think the discrepancies in question difficulty that you faced were in RC. In RC, the passages are classified as easy, medium and hard. Even when you pick a medium passage, you may face easy or hard questions. The difficulty level in the case of RC is therefore by passage, not by individual question.

The Quant and Verbal courses are structured topic-wise, starting with a quiz that gauges one’s level of understanding of each sub-topic, and progressing with a detailed explanation of the topics followed by quizzes on the studied topic. One is able to thoroughly comprehend the sub-topics with such well-structured course content. The reading comprehension course content is what I can vouch for, as it helped me improve my accuracy as well as my timing to solve RC passages.
Cementing quizzes: The Cementing quizzes, available in easy, medium, and hard difficulty, help one practice questions for a specific topic or under a mixed category. As soon as I felt comfortable after going through the sub-topics from the course content, I was advised to practice cementing quizzes for the specific sub-topic. Only after gaining a certain level of accuracy in the Cementing quizzes was I advised to move ahead to the next sub-topic. This approach helped me gain a decent level of understanding for each and every sub-topic.
Scholaranium: This is a very special offering by E-GMAT. A tool to analyse all the metrics based on your performance in the Scholaranium quizzes. Scholaranium helps one to directly identify one’s weak areas and helps to gauge progress in each and every aspect.
Sigma-X mocks: After going through all the advised course content and practicing multiple cementing quizzes, I attempted the Sigma-X mocks. The Sigma-X mocks are well designed to closely resemble the official GMAT test. My Sigma-X mock scores were 600, 650, 690, and 700. The improvement in these mock tests was only possible because of the constant feedback you get from the mentors who guide you through your journey.

5. AnalyticsWould make the product better:1. Quality of Math Questions 
2. Simpler solutions - specifically math 
3. Reading Comp passages are much longer than official versionI am a repeat GMAT test taker. I had a good experience with e-gmat. I did not see any improvement in my score. However, I did see improvement in my overall skill. I scored a 710 on my first test and was hoping to improve to 740. Unfortunately, even though my verbal raw scores improved V35 vs V39. Because of a 1 point drop in quant Q50 to Q49. The algorithm calculated my score to be 710 on my last attempt. 

I started to prepare for the GMAT in July 2022.  I took a free MGMAT mock test to establish a baseline and scored 630.  After a 2 week of studying Manhattan Prep SC and Quant I took an offical mock and scored 660. 

For my first attempt I utilized Magoosh, Official Prep materials and LSAT RC to prepare for the exam. I studied ~10-12 hours/week between August - November 12, before taking the exam, and scored 710 (V35 and Q50).  My overall score was exactly the same as the official mock test #6 (710).

The biggest weakness prior to e-gmat program was SC.  Specifically, I was very slow at  finding the correct answer for the SC question type. For my second attempt I utilized e-gmat and the OG advanced/guide 2022. My SC and CR improved by ~10-15 percentile points.  The methods used by e-gmat are very effective. 

I highly recommend utilizing e-gmat's mock and SC sections during the initial parts of your preparation. Once you have mastered all the concepts I recommend using the official guide quesions. You will find that due to nature of the e-gmat question bank you will find the official questions a lot easier to process. The  OG questions are typiclly shorter and more concise and e-gmat definitely helps with time management.

I did use the E-gmat mentorship program as well.  My mentor Abha was very responsive and provided me with a customized program. The program itself recommends using OG material as you get closer to the test. If any one has 3-4 months to prepare for the test and definitely recommend using the scholarium question bank to cement the concepts. 

Overall, I was not as impressed with the quant modules.  The questions are different from OG and real GMAT. However, the questions do allow you to master important concepts tested in the GMAT.  

Finally, I took all 5 mock exams. The mocks are harder to complete than the official test as the question prompts can be a bit longer. However, the mock exams predictions and analytics are quite accurate and help identify one's strengths and weaknesses. 

My final sigma mock was v39, Q49 - 720, and was the same as my official score. I never broke V40 on e-gmat and have yet to do so on the official GMAT as well!!

In conclusion, I rate the egmat program to be a valuable tool in GMAT preparation. The mentors can provide a lot of value to an individual who is not sure on how to structure their study plan.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=34#","0","0","","","March 14, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Atlas064,

I would also like them to keep test review access open even when the product time expires since I was unable to review the tests that I had already taken before test day since my GMAT exam was scheduled almost a month later from the time my product time expired.I would totally recommend e-GMAT for any new test taker.
Quants and CR are my strengths and EGMAT really strengthened my Quant and CR with their well curated content.
SC is still a weakness of mine, but I believe I improved a lot through the e-GMAT course. My RC abilities totally depend on the content of the passage. If I totally understood what the passage was trying to communicate in my first reading, I get almost all my answers right but when I find it difficult to completely understand the passage in my first reading, I become aware that getting all answers right would be tough for me.
With the full practice tests, I became aware of all my strengths and weaknesses and on Test Day I was very confident of getting a good score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=34#","0","0","","","March 09, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi surajitkalita25,

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Verbal Course is very comprehensive and very GMAT oriented.Would make the product better:I would personally recommend you to hide the color coding(Green/Red)  in the answer choices upon answering a question. If I get the question wrong, While reviewing I could see the correct answer choice(Highlighted in Green color) at a glance as in which option is the correct one but I personally wanted to give it a try again whether I got the question wrong because I rushed through or I had some gaps in the concept.
But, if there is another agenda for showing the color scheme as it is in the course,then keep going but I would like to know the agenda though😊.Here’s my review of e-GMAT.
After completing my BTech in 2021, I wanted to start my MBA preparation. So, I started without any guidance as I thought I wouldn’t need it.
Now, Having the zeal to prepare on your own is important so does having a right mentor, if not more.
After countless hours of research, I started using resources available on the internet but didn’t follow correct strategy nor was I on the right track. Despite all the hard work, I was stuck at mid 600s and the reason was obvious that I was just solving questions randomly under the impression that I knew all the basics already and that practice makes a person perfect.
But let me tell you this-It’s the RIGHT PRACTICE THAT MAKES YOU PERFECT.
Then I subscribed to e-GMAT(a friend suggested) to improve my VERBAL score as I was already good at QUANT.
Trust me when I say this- You only think you knew everything in verbal until you come across the course provided.
The attempt that the Verbal course designers made to try to make one understand each and every concept(relevant to GMAT Verbal) without one having to memorise is truly commendable.
I gave my Exam again on 1st March,2023 and scored 730(Q50,V39).

Here are the things I liked in the course from each of the three sections:

Sentence Correction(SC)-
I never would have thought of the concepts/application of the same, had I not come across the course. I loved the meaning based approach. I loved how the course sticked to the concepts relevant to the GMAT(I mean it was obvious of the amount of research you guys did while developing the course). The teaching really helped me to solve medium to hard question within 90secs.

Critical Reasoning(CR)-
Previously, I used to read the question,scan through the options directly and wonder how in the world could those options be relevant/correct in the context of the question. But the PRETHINKING process taught in the course not only helped me solve hard questions with ease but also developed my problem solving skills. Thanks team for this process. This process will help me in the real world too😎.

Reading comprehension(RC)- The strategies mentioned surely helped to speed up my reading and comprehending skills. And personally I believe that this section depends on the ability of the test taker ultimately.

Quizzes:
I liked the concept of cementing. I followed the plan to the tee and it is absolutely necessary to do so too. Reviewing the solutions to both correct and incorrect questions helped me to solidify the concepts.
Thanks to the team for responding to all my silly doubts/queries😅 within a day.

QUANT-
Kudos to the team for the PACE AI. I felt like it was tailed-made especially for me as I was already good at Quant and It helped me to save a lot of time by letting me avoid concepts that I was already good at and concentrate on solidifying the concepts in which I had some gaps.

Last mile push-
Last but not the least,
Let me talk about LMP(Last mile push though I thought it was Last minute Prep at first😂)
While there is no doubt about the Verbal course significantly improving my Verbal ability, I would also attribute my improvement (from V28 to V39) to LMP.
I followed the plan given to me, attempted test readiness quizzes and attempted two Sigma-X Mocks and scored 740,730 respectively. To my surprise, These mocks were very reliable as I got the exact score in my official GMAT as in my Sigma Mock.
Thanks Dhruv for prepping my plan, for conducting 1-on-1 sessions and giving me valuable insights, and responding to my mails immediately.

Thanks Payal for such a wonderful GMAT prep product.

My suggestion to all the aspirants,who feel at sea as to which prep course to go with, is to give it a try and you won’t regret.
To those who started your e-GMAT/already in the midway through the course, I would suggest you to trust the process, follow the course to the tee, make a habit of maintaining error logs, and analyse each and every answer choice to reassure yourself why you got it wrong or whether you got it right for the right reasons.
All the best!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=34#","0","0","","","March 09, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Hope46s  

Heartiest Congratulations to you on your 730 score!  

A 60-point overall improvement combined with an 11-point Verbal improvement (V28 to V39) is certainly an accomplishment that needs to be shared and spread. 

Your diligence throughout this journey has been at the core of your success.  

As you have mentioned, you followed every suggested plan to the ‘TEE’. Your improvement in your CR abilities was due to the combination of your sincerity and the pre-thinking approach. This in turn led to a significant reduction in the takt time as well as can be seen in this image below

For CR, I found e-gmat course to be a bit confusing. pre-thinking does not always work. Also, I found some explanations to be insufficient.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Structured theory, UX/UI, great analytics, flexible quizzes, methods & approaches taughtWould make the product better:Nothing, everything was greatBecause of high workload (combining full-time job in consulting and finishing my bachelor degree) I was able to start my preparation for GMAT only at the beginning of 2023. At the same time I had to pass the exam in mid February, so that I could have some time for preparing all the other things for the application. This all led to just one month of prep. I wanted to start on January 2, however I needed some time to recover, so I started only on the January 9. I took a vacation at my job for a month, however I still had 3 exams to pass at the university at that period. I completed my first free mock at e-GMAT on the January 9, then purchased the e-GMAT subscription and booked an appointment for GMAT the next day. My exam was set on the February 8, and that’s how my preparation started.
The reason for choosing e-GMAT for me was simple – my mentor with a score of 740 told me that e-GMAT was the best preparation service he used in his prep. 
My mock result was 630 (Q47 V29). I knew, that Verbal section was my major weakness (as for many non-native speakers), so I focused on it for the whole prep period. And here comes the first thing I loved about e-GMAT: they provide extremely detailed analysis of your mocks and quizzes. From this analytics I knew, that my skills at RC are ok, but I have a lot to improve in SC & CR. 
At this point I started e-GMAT Master Comprehension course. In fact, it solved my major problem: I was reading the questions multiple times but didn’t understand anything. After completing this course I felt a lot more confident as I started to fully understand the questions. Personally, I think this course is a MUST for non-native speakers if they want to achieve high Verbal score.
Then I started SC course. It was very difficult for my to memorize all the concepts in such a short time, however I did it pretty successfully. I should notice here that the approach to solving SC questions was extremely helpful. It gave me a straightforward structured way to solve both mid & hard difficulty questions. After completing the “theory” I moved to “practice”: I completed few quizzes in SC and saw a significant improvement, thanks again to detailed analytics provided.
At this point I had less then 2 weeks to my exam date and started CR course. While reviewing the concepts I understood that this type of questions is easy for me, so I did a review of my first mock again and noticed that my bad score was due to timing failure: I randomly clicked the last questions because of lack of time, which dropped my CR result (at the beginning of the mock I performed very well). That meant that if I fix my timing problems in SC (which I already did) I can already have a better result. This made me more confident, so I “rushed through” the CR “theory part”. I still completed all the course, but I was skipping some parts of videos, when I understood that I already knew these concepts well enough. Then I also did some quizzes and was left with 2 days before the exam. I’ve spent those on refreshing some formulas and approaches for Quant in express manner and took my exam.
So my improvements are:
630 -> 720
Q47 -> Q49
V29 -> V39
In the end I’d like to summarize all the thing I liked at e-GMAT (and that helped me to achieve such improvement in less then a month). The first and the most important thing for such express prep is the fact that e-GMAT is a great one-stop-shop for GMAT: it has theory courses, quizzes, mocks and personalized analytics all in one place. Secondly, courses structure and content are great: these are really MECE, so they provide you with all the concepts you need and do it in a way that you can memorize them fast. Thirdly, the overall quality of materials, UI/UX, tests was great. For me, it plays a great role in overall experience: if you are comfortable with using the tool, you’ll be able to extract maximum value of it, which is totally about e-GMAT. So, I really liked the product, I’m very thankful to the e-GMAT team and my mentor who recommended it to me.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=34#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The modules are designed in order to really focus on meeting the student across all learning stages - concept understanding, retrieval, cementing, to actual applications. The modules are sequenced in a manner that gradually helps one apply concepts & ""cement"" the knowledge for its application in a very new/foreign environment (actual exam) which reduces the chances of guesswork.Would make the product better:I personally felt that the question banks especially for the verbal section could be improved/made tougher to give a real sense of the exam environment. The verbal section for the sigma mocks was easier than the actual exam. 

Additionally, a lot more supporting materials for certain hard topics (750+ level) could be provided that are more targeted/less generic.Would definitely recommend taking this course for someone who is planning to get massive improvements in their score via a dedicated/clear action plan, especially for the verbal section. The math section also prepares one pretty well for the actual exam (which is much easier). 

Kudos to their mentors & the LMP program in general - this program really enables one to focus on the right thing at the right time, without wasting much time in planning what/how one needs to study. The structured study plans/programs are definitely a highlight for a working individual who doesn't have much time to think/plan their prep. Mentors also enable you to move in the right direction & have a clear trajectory of what is needed/not needed in the whole preparation journey. Special shoutout to Akash who was always up for helping/guiding/supporting & mentoring me through the different learning phases! 

In addition, the modules are structured in a manner that meets you in your own learning journey, without making it too generic/specific. 

Lastly, the analytics/algorithm adds to your reflection journey by helping you pinpoint your weaker areas or areas of concern so you can create a more targeted revision plan & focus more on the weaker/strength areas.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=35#","0","0","","","February 27, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear SS97,

It understood where all I can falter, what is the right way to think and what I might be doing but is not to be done. Most importantly, it focused on the basics and the core process, NO SHORTCUTS. This helped me to build the confidence that I will be able to tackle questions of all types and levels during the main exam. 

The course is very much structured and saves number of hours for any student. Meaning based approach in SC and Pre-thinking in CR do wonders to solve any question. Scholaranium is a very good tool for doing quizzes and analysing one’s skills deeply. Also, the team provides constant support and guidance throughout the journey. I have mailed them for everything that came up to my mind: asking about what study strategies to follow, what are my weak areas, what improvement plan to follow etc. Special mention to Rida Shafeek, my mentor and Abha Mohan who helped me with the improvement plan. e-GMAT team has always been there to help and support, especially when my course plan was getting over on 9th Jan 2023 and they extended it till 18th Jan as per my scheduled exam. 

 In the initial mock I got a 610. I started my GMAT journey in October 2022 and with the recommendation of my brother I took the e-GMAT course from the start itself. I feel very happy to share that I scored a total of 720 ( V36 Q50 ) in my GMAT retake in Feb 2023. In my earlier attempt in Jan 2023, my score was 650 (V29 Q49). I felt that it did not do justice to all the preparation I had been doing for the exam and planned to give a retake as soon as possible.

Overall, I really enjoyed the journey as much as I enjoyed the result. I would highly recommend the e-GMAT course to all GMAT aspirants.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=35#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:The quality of questions are at par with the actual gmat and the mentorship support is excellentWould make the product better:Some of the questions from the word problem section of quants are out of scope , in terms of the question sizes and also being highly calculation intensive.I had scored 700 twice in the gmat, when I was enrolled with another test provider. My verbal section, especially CR, had taken a hit in both the attempts. My target score was 740. After my 2nd gmat attempt (at the end of September 2022), I decided to enroll in egmat’s online course. I had watched a couple of their free webinar sessions in youtube and was quite impressed with their methodology and their process.  Having scored back to back 700 in the actual test, I was starting at a higher ability. Hence I was invited to join the LMP program, when I enrolled for the course. Rashmi was my mentor in the LMP program.
CR has been my weakest area in verbal  ever since I started my gmat prep. Before joining egmat, I resorted to “brute practice” in which I solved a few hundred CR questions from  gmatclub, hoping  that I become good at CR through relentless practice. I never had a structure or methodology while solving CR questions at that time. As a result, I did not develop the necessary skillset required to solve CR questions in the actual test, under the time constraint. I ended up performing poorly in this subsection in both my previous gmat attempts(50 percentile on both occasions). 
At the start of the LMP program, rashmi laid out the verbal plan  which was very effective and which  targeted my weak areas, notably CR. She emphasized the importance of prethinking while solving CR questions and to trust the process, even though it might take me a while to get accustomed to it. I started out by going through the concept videos, followed by the concept files and the application files. True to it’s name, the cementing quizzes helped me to cement the process in my mind. My accuracy in CR shot up gradually with time, as I began to subconsciously apply the prethinking framework.
Even though I was pretty good at sentence correction(SC), I decided to go through the SC module as well. The SC module has been well structured and is very detailed. Going through this module once again helped me to reinforce the concepts and the meaning-based-approach methodology, which in turn pushed my SC accuracy even higher. 
The quant module is at par with the best in the market. The PACE engine pinpoints the weak areas and selectively makes one go through certain subsections/concept videos which reduces the preparation time to a great extent .I was very satisfied with the concept videos and the concept files and the application files. Overall, Quant 2.0 played a vital role in pushing my quant score from a  q49 to a q50.
The quality of questions in the scholaranium is top notch. They are at par with the actual gmat questions, especially in verbal. For quants, the scholaranium questions are slightly more difficult than the questions in the actual test. 
The Sigma-X mock tests are very accurate and representative of the actual gmat, in terms of the quality of questions and the adaptive nature of the test. The best part of the Sigma-X mock  is the detailed analysis that follows after each mock test. I found the analysis chart to be quite similar to the ESR report from the actual test.
Last but not the least, the mentorship support has been excellent. Frankly, the LMP program has far exceeded my expectations. Rashmi has guided me brilliantly throughout the course of our tenure. Her quick turnaround time in responses and her precision planning targeted at my weak areas helped me to boost my score in both quant and verbal. She kept track of my progress and performance through the available data in the platform  and suggested improvement plans accordingly. She  intervened from time to time to ensure that I was on track with the set plan and provided moral support whenever I felt down and out after a poor quiz/mock performance.
Finally, I was able to hit my target score of 740(q50,v40) .
In the end, when you trust reliable data and take cues from it, the result shows.
Overall my experience with egmat has been fantastic and I would highly recommend their course to any diligent student out there.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=35#","0","0","","","February 10, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Deep19061994,

https://success.e-gmat.com/Deep19061994s-Study-Plan  

It is impressive how recognizing that “brute practice” will not help you with CR, you set about systematically learning the processes that would help with improvement.  You immersed yourself completely in laying the foundation by learning concepts and applications and then mastering them through working on GMAT-like questions in cementing. See how the time you spent on mastering the Pre-thinking approach helped you improve your accuracy across all the topics in CR. 

https://success.e-gmat.com/Deep19061994-Pre-Thinking-helps-imporve-accuracy  

In SC, despite starting at a higher ability, you revised your concepts and applications and internalized the Meaning-Based approach that helped you improve from an 85th percentile to a 95th percentile ability in SC.  

I am glad that the course helped you improve from a Q49 to a Q50 in Quant, and I am happy that you leveraged the time-saving feature (P.A.C.E.) of Quant 2.0 to be able efficiently complete the course.  

It is good to know that you found the questions on the Scholaranium and the SIGma-X mock at par with the actual GMAT questions. I must commend you for utilizing the data analytics on the platform to further sharpen your skills and enhance your ability. As you have rightly said, “when you trust reliable data and take cues from it, the result shows” and congratulations on using this data-driven approach to reach the top 3% on the GMAT. 

I thank you for your input on WP questions, however, I believe that preparing for the GMAT is like preparing for a battle. By putting in the effort during practice, you will be better equipped to succeed during the actual test. 

Deep19061994, I am really glad that all these efforts paid off and you were able to get to your target score. I wish you all the best for your forthcoming interviews from all your dream b-schools.

It was E-GMAT who helped me in reaching my goals. I started my journey in September by buying my E-GMAT Course 360 for 4 months. Initially I could not dedicate much time to my preparations but in the later months I committed at least 10 hours a week. Being a medical intern in a government college, it was not easy to find time and analyze how to study. E-GMAT helped me a lot by preparing a personalized study plan for me. I started my journey with 620 on my sigma x mock. I set my targets and E-GMAT helped me create a dedicated timeline to create a timetable effectively dicing my time in required areas. 
The quant section was beautifully divided and broken down into topics and sub topics. The initial diagnostic quizzes in each topic helped me save a lot of time by segregating topics I was weak at needed to study vs topics I was good at. These modules, followed by practice quizzes, helped me create strong concepts. The framework for various topics and approach to the questions has been effectively covered by E-GMAT course. 
The verbal section had ample of application files and quizzes to help me understand the process to approach a question and help me arrive at correct solutions.  Pre-Thinking, Meaning Based Analysis, Frameworks, among other tools, were strong weapons in my arsenal which helped me conquer my verbal fear. 
The strategy of dividing the preparation in three stages to effectively create concepts, cement them and then achieve accuracy was the best part about the course. This strategy helped me create a strong foundation which enabled me to score 730 on the first attempt.
I improved especially in the verbal section, from scoring V26 to V39. The Xpert analysis of quizzes and the Sigma Mock was very insightful in helping me understand my weakness and improve my score. But the guidance from the E-GMAT mentors, especially Dhruv, helped me a lot during my preparation, without whom, I would have never reached my goal.
I highly recommend the E-GMAT course. It is very useful, whether you are starting the preparation from zero, or are looking for a score improvement. On starting, kindly go through all instructions on how to best effectively use the course and follow their instructions, even if you feel that you don’t need them.

1st attempt
I gave my 1st attempt at the GMAT exam in Oct’21. My score was 610. I aimed to achieve around 720 as this score was around the average score of my target B-schools (1-year program in IIMs, ISB). I used officia1-year books for preparation. During the exam preparation, I found several verbal solutions posted by e-GMAT on the GMAT Club portal. The answers from e-GMAT were based on a structured approach and were easy to understand for a non-native English speaker like me. Therefore, I decided to enroll in the e-GMAT course.
e-GMAT course
I enrolled for GMAT online 360 course. This course covers Quant, Verbal, and IR. I chose this course because I did not want to spend my limited time searching resources for Quant.
2nd attempt
I gave my 2nd attempt at the end of Sep’22, and my score was 640.
Here I want to share critical information:
As I shared above, I have worked in the electronics industry for the last 12 months. I worked around six days per week and 14-15 hours per day. All the credit goes to the unanticipated surge in demand for semiconductors due to the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances. This work schedule only allowed me to study for around 45 minutes per day on working days and 2 hours per day on holidays. Therefore, I was able to give my 2nd attempt in Sept’22.
After scoring 640, I wrote to e-GMAT for their expert guidance. And from there, Rida Shafeek strategy expert, guided me to score 740.
3rd attempt (all thanks to Improvement Plan by Rida Shafeek, the e-GMAT strategy expert)
Based on my ESR report, she shared the improvement plan for all sections (one by one after I was able to clear the passing criterion) for each section:
A) RC
B) SC
C) CR
D) Quant
Even before completing Improvement Plan for Quant, I appeared for the e-GMAT exam, and the final score was 740 (more than my target score, I was so happy).
My strategy during the GMAT exam
Based on my experience of cementing quizzes, I realized that my mind needs some time to warm up. So, I attempted sections in the following order:
i) AWA
ii) IR
(AWA, IR: helped to warm up the mind)

iii) Quant

iv) Verbal
Advantages of the e-GMAT course
A) The course modules are designed carefully to build/improve the basic concepts. Please complete the course in an order prescribed by the e-GMAT team.
B) The structured methodology of e-GMAT helps build a process to approach every question. For the verbal section, I am confident that it is one of the best courses for non-native speakers (I am not sure about the grammatical accuracy of native speakers).
C) Cementing process (Medium, Hard level) helps to solidify the learning. Please complete these stages.
D) AI-based analytics by e-GMAT helps to analyze the areas of improvement. This tool is fantastic.
E) PACE engine helped me to save a lot of time on the quant section.
Finally, I want to share a couple of points.
A) Plan for the GMAT exam based on your work/academic commitment.
B) Consistency is key.
C) A higher score always helps to strengthen your chances in your target B school.
D) Do not compare your performance based on the success stories of other applicants. The capabilities and circumstances of each person are different.

1. Comprehensive and structured course
2. The emphasis on meaning & Pre-thinking Approach
3. Personalised support for strategic performance analysis and planning
4. The accuracy of the mocks

I decided to attempt the free mock by e-gmat in July'22. 
I got a 560, which was quite discouraging. However, as part of their process, the e-gmat team asked me to get on a call with them and encouraged me to give it a go. Moreover, considering that I had attempted this mock without any preparation, it seemed like I could achieve a better score with some practice and concept revision. So after returning from a work related trip, I enrolled to the course in September'22. 

Over the next two months I studied 2-3 hrs a day and completed the video lectures and the practice & cementing quizes, which btw are well structured to give a holistic exposure of certain topics, build process skills, and practice varied question types. 
Then around October-end I decided to give my first mock and got a 640. Seeing the improvement of 80 points, I felt there is a good chance that with more practice I could get 700+. However I lacked direction of what approach to take. I was confident about my quant yet was unable to cross 48, and in verbal I was having difficulty crossing even 30.

At this point I remembered that in the early lectures a 3-step approach had been mentioned. 
1. Concept & practice, 
2. Cementing, and
3. Test readiness.
Since I was done with 1 & 2, I emailed the support team and asked about the 'stage 3' process. This is when I started interacting with Dhruv, who did an in-depth analysis of my performance so far and gave me a step-by-step personalised plan to improve. He also helped me whenever I faced a blocker and encouraged me every step of the way. 

Finally as the January application deadlines approached, I gave another mock scoring a 700 and rushed to book a GMAT slot. Dhruv supported my decision with some last minute steps to improve, which led to the official score of 720 (Q49, V40).

I'm grateful for all the support, and really recommend all GMAT aspirants to consider the e-gmat course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=35#","0","0","","","December 29, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi kshitij234,

But to my surprise, the course exceeded my expectations in terms of not only the structure and content of the course but also the mocks that were quite comparable to the actual GMAT and the on-prompt mentorship provided which helped me in analyzing further the data points to pinpoint the gaps in my preparation. 

The course is well-designed, well-structured, and quite intuitive. It makes online learning easier. With the Practice Quiz and Application Quiz between the modules, I was able to retrieve many of the concepts taught and solidify them during the Cementing Quizzes. This helped me to build the foundation of one section before moving to the next one. 

The analysis provided is good enough to understand your gaps and corrective measures to be decided. This is where error logs would help.

The Sigma-X mocks were quite analogous to the actual GMAT. Since I scored twice the same score in the actual GMAT that I got in the e-GMAT Sigma-X mock taken previously.

Lastly, when my course was over, I was blank on what to do next. At that point my mentors (special mention to Abha and Richa) weighed in on the exact gaps in my preparation and how can I improve upon them. They provided regular plans to up my game and help me the target they anticipated.

Their quant section teaches you all the concepts from basics and focuses on building a strong foundation rather than shortcuts. However, you can also check out their forums where multiple students have given various methods of solving problems, if your foundations are strong, you will be able to figure out the logic behind shortcuts as well. They will feed you so many questions during learning itself for both verbal and quants, that you will automatically start feeling confident. The verbal section gives you a variety of used cases and also talks about exceptions. 
They have a mentorship proramme (if you are serious) and they chalk out your plan for the last few days before your test.

I was stuck at the V27-V32 range before I came across eGMAT. 

Critical reasoning and sentence correction sections of eGMAT are one of a kind. Having used multiple sources, I can say that eGMAT has all the important content that is just required to achieve a high target score.
Pre-thinking concept comes in very handy in the exam, but one needs to practice extensively to improve the timing before the exam. It greatly improved my accuracy and time/question initially. But eventually, things become second nature and one can easily see the time/question going down.

Sentence correction course will be an eye-opener to many as it highlights a lot of exemptions to the grammar rules which are applicable to the GMAT. eGMATs forum support has been amazing in giving prompt and in-depth analysis for any queries posted. 

RC course is well-made for the ones that get stuck between 2 close options. eGMATs RC process will give students enormous clarity in answer choice analysis. This works wonders for people who can apply the process well but miss out on marking the correct choice. Identifying the type of incorrect answers for each and every practice question kind of drills down the concepts into you before you realise. So I think using the video course to the maximum potential will massively help you improve your score.

eGMAT saves the hard work and a lot of time for aspirants who spend time self studying and searching online for free resources. eGMAT's  study plan, swift forum, mentors who communicate with you promptly can be of real help to the students. These were the factors that were critical in my score improvement from V27 to V38.

Structured ContentI gave my first GMAT attempt back in August'22, but due to a network issue in the test centre (Ansal University) my test got ruined and I couldn't reschedule it as I had to leave for college the next day. Although I was pretty devastated about it, the moment I reached home I made up my mind to give another attempt in my winter vacations. During my self-preparation I had seen the content of most of the test-prep companies and due to the short time available to me, I felt that e-gmat would be the perfect fit for me as they were known for their personalised study plan. 

During the three weeks of my GMAT preparation, I was enrolled in the LMP Program by Abha Ma'am. She gave me a detailed study plan and I was in constant contact with her throughout. I followed the plan diligently and kept on getting regular feedback about my performance. 

Quant: I would like to give a special mention to the cementing quizzes on the e-gmat platform. These quizzes have a selected set of questions, which are made to exploit the holes  in your learning. I found these especially helpful for quant because even though I had a strong foundation in all the topics, these quizzes pointed out exactly where I need to pay attention. 

RC: The effective reading strategies are really a blessing and improved my RC ability significantly. I could notice the difference in the results after I followed each step systematically.

SC and CR: The famous meaning based approach works wonderfully and should be carefully followed for it to work its magic. 

Overall, e-gmat offers great structured, quality content that is more than enough for your GMAT preparation.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Personalized feedback Here's my GMAT journey :
I decided to go with GMAT exam in 2019. Since I already prepared for CAT in India, I thought I won't need any new coaching. So I bought the official guide and advanced guide. watched few youtube videos on Sentence correction rules. I was fairly confident after solving the official guides so went with official mocks. As far as I remember, below are the scores.
Official mock 1 - 730
Official mock 2 - 700
Official mock 3 - 710
Official mock 4 - 720
These scores were right in my target range and these were official mocks, that too 4 of them. What confirmation else do I need? ""This is most accurate prediction of what my actual score on GMAT might be"" I thought. Boy was I so wrong.
I gave my first official GMAT attempt in December 2019.
After the exam, the score popped up - a 650. This was devastating. This is not even close to my official mocks. 
I was dissapointed. But I had only close to 2 years of experience and I knew that average work experience in US MBA colleges is around 5 years. So I knew I have time.  

I kept preparing from other sources that I could find for next 1.5 years. But this was not a serious preparation, not even close. Fast forward to October 2021. I decided to ramp up my GMAT preparation as I have almost 4 years of work ex in next 4 months. I watched few youtube free sessions and e-GMAT caught my attention. 
Why?? Because they had a super power. They read my mind. After the great GMAT debacle of 2019, I went into retrospection mode. And in my retrospection, all strategies and concepts that I realized were cause for my low score, were specifically mentioned by e-GMAT also to be major causes for lower scores of candidates in the GMAT. They also kept giving importance to 'No shortcuts to success in GMAT' mantra. 
So I signed up and looked at the free modules and realised that this might be the course that I needed. I purchased the course in January 2022.
I blindly followed their module because, as I mentioned earlier, they were reading my mind. For every time some skepticism popped up in my mind be it about my ability or whenever I felt like I don't have it in me to succeed in GMAT, they already had a video debrief on youtube with candidates who went exactly through what I was going but still got a great GMAT score. This boosted my confidence that it is not just me - everybody feels the same - If they could do it - I can too. So I kept going with the modules, cemeneting quizzes, test readiness quizzes and finally the mocks. 
The mocks are the most important of all as they even showed how the scored progressed with every question/block that I attempted. This helped me with coming with my own startegy that suits my personal style. 1 week before the GMAT official exam, Payal Tandon reached out to me saying that they observed inactivity on my account and asked me if there were any change of plans. I told that I have my GMAT exam in next 5 days. They immediately assigned me a mentor under Last Mile Program. Unfortunately I had only 3 more days to do what the suggested based on my weak areas. Yet they made a plan and scheduled video call sessions to help in with the last leg.
D-Day, I gave my exam on June 30th 2022 (offline centre exam) and it was 700.

Then I joined the ELP program to get feedback from mentors and followed their advice. 
I gave my 3rd attempt after 2 months from my second attempt and the score 740 flashed on my screen.

Thanks to e-GMAT for their well-structured course and for not selling 'tricks to ace GMAT' just to onboard as many students as they can.
Special thanks to Rida Shafeek for taking time and mentoring me in the last days of my exam.

For anyone trying to decide which online course to go for, I will 100% recommend e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","2","0","","","","","",""

And most importantly, a very special thanks to the extremely talented, prompt, and professional team at eGMAT, especially Ms. Rashmi. The kind of handholding she did in the last phase of my preparation, especially focussing on my weak spots, providing step by step approach, following up on my progress, I can’t thank her enough for her role in my success story.

I appeared for the GMAT exam for the first time in 2018. Since I am an engineer and loved maths and had this feeling that I am good at English, I reached the exam hall with 2-3 months of self-study with official GMAT materials and came out with a disappointing 660(Q49 V30). Disappointed with this score and then overwhelmed with family and professional responsibilities I dropped the idea of GMAT.

In Dec 2021, I realized that in order to break the monotonous job cycle, I need an MBA and hence a good GMAT score. And this time i would not be approaching the exam ill prepared. I analyzed my weaknesses and simultaneously researched for the best online course to prepare with. And my thorough analysis led me to ‘eGMAT Online Course’.  I started the preparation, but it wasn't a smooth ride till around July 2022, because of my demanding work schedule. Only in July I started following the structured approach as per eGMAT course structure. I started with SC, followed by CR, and then RC. Quants, I approached last. And for each of these sections, I followed the eGMAT’s principles as it is:

SC: 
eGMAT course adds a whole new dimension to approaching SC sentences. The Meaning based approach that you learn is the only solution to 700 range questions. There is no way around this for anybody 🙂

CR:
Pre-Thinking approach not only saves a lot of time, but also, it's very organic and lays out a methodical framework which an engineer like me needs to solve problems.

RC:
Reading for GMAT is unlike any other reading approach. The art of visualization that I learnt after going through the course saved time and improved my accuracy, especially on 700+ questions.

I completed the course going through concepts, application files, solving cementing quizzes and scoring 740+ on mocks. I appeared for an exam in Aug 2022, and my score bombed at 680. I was devastated. I had zero doubts about my preparation, but probably the pressure of the actual GMAT exam, or probably the difference in aspect ratio of my small sized laptop vs the big screen in exam center, or probably the discomfort of big sized noise cancellation headphones became some of the reasons for the tanking of my score.
I immediately approached the eGMAT team and they offered me the LMP program. I was skeptical about that, so I declined, but Ms Rasmi from the eGMAT team was kind enough to motivate me for a reattempt.

I booked a slot in Sept 2022, and from that point of time to the exam date, the kind of support I received from Ms Rashmi has been invaluable. I was very thorough with eGMAT material, and the eGMAT strategies for each of the sections. Ms Rashmi identified my weaknesses by analyzing my past tests scores, approach to questions etc. That’s where I would like to mention the GUI and kind of data analytics the eGMAT software platform does is amazing. eGMAT team even extended my subscription by 11 days short of exam without a single penny on my request, else I would have to pay entire subscription amount.  And, her step-by-step guidance led me to break the 680 ceiling and I scored 720. It was indeed a very happy and satisfying day for me.

See how this data-driven approach helped you go from a 65% accuracy to a 95% accuracy for hard questions in SC: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/90-percent-accuracy-for-SC-hard-questions  

I am really glad that the efforts paid off and you were able to get to a 720 with a V40 - a 10-point improvement from your first attempt.  

I appreciate your feedback on the hard quant questions. But as they say, if you sweat in practice, you do not bleed in the battle. You need to have an exposure to questions from all difficulty levels so that you are not surprised or thrown aback on the day of the test. 

I know it hasn’t been a smooth journey and as you have rightly said, a roller coaster ride to success. I am sure this never-say-die attitude will help you in all the facets of your life in the future and help you ace the next stage of your journey.  

All the best and best Regards,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I enrolled with e-gmat towards the end of June 2022, after spending some months on my GMAT prep with another test prep company and a mediocre GMAT score. Getting an e-gmat subscription changed the whole course of my GMAT prep. I earlier relied a lot on guess-work and instincts to pick an answer choice. Later, the whole process became entirely logic driven and concept based. What I loved about e-gmat -

i.	Course structure

The e-gmat course has been wonderfully designed with superb analytics and a student-friendly user interface. I was initially asked to take a sigma-X mock, and using results of that score a personalised study plan (PSP) was created for me. The PSP took into account my current abilities and amount of time I could devote to my GMAT prep and came up with the plan that I needed to follow in order to achieve my target score. The plan was designed in the most optimum possible way.

ii.	Course content

The e-gmat team has wonderfully designed the entire course content. Each module, be it Verbal or Quant, has been so beautifully designed, that a student need not refer alternate resources for anything. The Master Comprehension module was really useful. It put me in the habit of consciously reading, with an intent to absorb the meaning. The content videos are short and crisp, and cover the subject matter comprehensively. The practice files and the application files after each concept videos helped me solidify my understanding before moving to the next concept. Although I initially planned to use the subscription for the Verbal course, I ended up going through their Quant modules as well!

iii.	Methods learned

I.	SC
The e-gmat methods of learning were a game-changer for me. I earlier relied on a lot of guess-work and luck to arrive at the correct answer. For SC, their meaning-based approach helped me understand the meaning of the question statement and the author’s intent. This is a very crucial step, as it helped me eliminate answer choices that were grammatically correct but worded in such a fashion, that the meaning changed entirely. The meaning-based approach is especially useful when it comes to solving Hard level SC questions.
II.	CR
I can’t emphasize enough on the usefulness of the pre-thinking activity in CR. For a major part of my GMAT prep journey, I ended up with 2 answer choices in CR. I would then end up choosing either of them, and thought that there was nothing I could do to change this. The pre-thinking approach helped me pause, and visualize the entire argument. It precisely helped me visualize the conclusion and come up with a solid framework to analyse the answer choices. This entirely eliminated the need to revisit the question stem, and read the answer choices again and again. I was able to confidently mark the correct answer choice. I took a lot of time to develop this habit, but my mentor Rashmi, provided me with a lot of tips and plenty of useful content to perfect this process.
III.	RC
Honestly, I had discounted it initially, leading to a poor accuracy in RC. But after following the e-gmat structured approach to RC, I realized how important it is to tackle RC in the right way. The modules are wonderfully designed and focus a lot on comprehending the passage and understanding the author’s intent. It helped me consciously absorb the meaning and the tone of the author. It enabled me to identify the incorrect choices and select the correct one on solid grounds.
IV.	Quant
The quant module is very thoughtfully designed. The PACE module saved me a lot of time and allowed me to focus on only those modules that were necessary. The entire quant module emphasizes on process skills, and following these process skills clearly enabled me to approach quant questions the right way. It eliminated any possibility of making errors while solving questions. Each concept video in quant wonderfully explains the concept, along with adequate questions for practice to solidify your understanding.

iv.	Analytics / Questions / Mocks

The best part of the e-gmat course is the Scholaranium. The quality of questions and the solutions provided to it are top-notch. They resemble a lot with the questions on the GMAT. After each practice quiz, the analytics came up with really good recommendations and quickly highlighted my weak areas and what I could do to polish those. The Cementing quizzes after each module helped me cement my concepts in the best possible way. It also identified any gaps and my mentor would then guide me how to polish those. The custom quizzes feature allowed me to practice test-readiness, by allowing me to pick and choose questions from any topic and practice it. The sigma-X mocks provide a very close representation of the actual test, and are a great way to guage your performance.

v.	Mentorship support and Last Mile Push program

Rashmi, my mentor from the e-gmat team has been a blessing in this entire GMAT journey! She would analyze my performance in every module and provide me with a clear road-map for the next steps. She would come up with very detailed analysis of my quiz attempts and provided me plans that I could follow with my work commitments. After she onboarded me in the Last Mile cohort, she came up with an elaborate plan specially designed to help me get to my target score. She designed a module-wise improvement and revision plan, keeping in mind my time constraints and other commitments. The amount of effort she has put in to help me get to my target score is HUGE. It wouldn’t have been possible without Rashmi’s effort. At times the plans that she made me follow and revisiting modules when I didn’t perform well on the practice tests felt cumbersome. But she kept me going, motivated me when I felt low and not-so-confident about my performance on the test. Huge thanks to you, Rashmi! The Last Mile Push program is a great product designed by the e-gmat team. It helps you push your score beyond the upper-600’s to reach the 700’s. the support team at e-gmat is always an e-mail or a call away, I can only advise students to follow to your mentor’s suggestions to the last T!

Overall, the e-gmat is a wonderful product to cater to all your GMAT prep requirements. The course content along with the mentorship support is fantastic! I’d like to thank the entire e-gmat team in helping me achieve my desired score!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on a massive 90-point improvement to 720😊 It has been wonderful working with you in this journey towards success.  

Unmani, you made certain right decisions along the way that helped you get to that 720:

1. You started the right way by assessing your staring ability and creating a personalized study plan to chart your preparation path 

2. You followed this with a structured approach to building the fundamentals that helped you get to the 90th percentile in verbal. This image shows how the time that you spent on learning the foundations helped you get to a 92% accuracy for modifiers questions:  

https://success.e-gmat.com/Foundation-helps-build-ability  

3. Having built the foundation, you then mastered the applications by practicing GMAT-like questions through cementing. Recognizing that a “guesswork” based approach in SC was not working, you set about internalizing the meaning-based approach that helped you improve to a 95th percentile in SC. 

4. You persevered despite setbacks. As you have mentioned, you took a lot of time to master the pre-thinking approach in CR, but you did not give up, and in the end, perfected this helping you answer hard CR questions with ease. This image shows how this helped you improve to a 90th percentile ability in CR: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/Unmanis-90-pecentile-CR-ability  

5. While following a similar diligent approach in quants, you leveraged the PACE-time-saving feature allowing you to save 45 hours of overall preparation. See how in Geometry alone you saved close to 6 hours: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/PACE-time-saving-in-Geometry  

6. Having built your ability, you then worked on building your test-taking skill by creating mixed quizzes to build your stamina and ability to navigate between different question types.  

7. You supplemented all these efforts by leveraging the data analytics on the platform to identify and work on areas of weakness.  

8. You diligently followed all plans that I as your mentor suggested even when it felt repetitive or tedious.  

Success is not an incidental happening, but it is a result of all the right decisions that you make along the way. I congratulate you on having made these right decisions and charting out the path to GMAT success.  

It has been a pleasure working with you and I wish you all the absolute best in the next phase of your life.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Initial preparation by myself: 

I started to seriously focus on GMAT in May 2022. I had just moved to a new country and was settling into a new job, while juggling a bunch of extracurricular activities. Having gone through the Official Guide already, I knew I needed help to get an attractive score for a top b-school, help particularly in Verbal. While I enjoyed solving CR questions, I was quite slow with RC and SC was my worst enemy. I often felt confused even after reading SC solutions as I lacked the appropriate knowledge of gmat SC rules. 
I began researching options and found a lot of positive reviews for e-GMAT, so I decided to put my bet on it. I had scheduled my first exam on July 28th. I had roughly 2.5 months to prepare. In those 2.5 months I went through all the verbal concepts in e-gmat, completed the advanced OG book, and tried all the official mocks. I was repeatedly scoring 740, 750 in the official mocks with Q50s and V40s. I felt really pleased. I thought I would be done and dusted with gmat in no time. Gee, was I wrong. My official score of 680 (Q47, V35) glared back at me. I was mortified. I didn’t even reach 700. 

Targeted Improvement with the help of e-gmat mentor: 

I wrote to e-gmat asking for guidance on my strategy for re-attempting it. That’s when Rashmi, my strategy mentor came into my life like an Angel. I also realized I had under-estimated GMAT quant. The quant in the official guides and mocks is actually a lot easier than the real exam. This had taken me off guard. I also realized I needed to practice applying SC concepts better as I was often guessing between 2 options. 
Rashmi helped me identify weak areas and prepare an improvement plan to go over the concepts I needed help in. It was then that I started using Scholaranium (e-gmat’s question practice tool) too. Rashmi helped me prepare customized tests to cement the concepts I learnt. Scholaranium is honestly a wonderful tool that has a large pool of gmat-style questions categorized based on difficulty, sub topic etc. You have a lot of flexibility to cater your practice to your specific needs. Scholaranium’s pool of hard quant questions actually reflect the difficulty level of the kind of questions you’ll face on test day. I had scheduled my exam for November. In between preparation I had a few obstacles like a knee injury, covid, travels related to family emergencies etc. Although we hadn’t completely finished the improvement plan I decided to still give it a shot and attempt the test as I was hoping I could apply for this upcoming application cycle. I scored 700 (V38, Q48). 

Final attempt: 

I was happy to reach 700s, but I wanted to improve it further. I came to know about e-gmat’s last mile push program - an intensive 30 day focussed plan. Rashmi made my life easier by laying out each day’s plan and tracked my progress through interactive dashboards. It felt motivating to see the plan ahead of time and encouraged me to meet each milestone on the targeted date. The last week of the plan, we spent doing a couple of sigma mocks in which I scored 740 (Q48, V42) and 750 (Q49, V42). I felt a lot more confident with verbal and started enjoying SC questions too. I went through the SC concept files multiple times to solidify my understanding of the process and rules. I was able to eliminate each option on solid grounds a lot more confidently. I ended up scoring a 720 (Q48, V41). 

Introspection: 

In hindsight I feel I could’ve improved my quant a bit more, but I am happy with the 720 and extremely happy with the V41. Also during the actual exam after my break I got lost in the test center and wasted ~4 minutes of my time for verbal while I found my way back to the correct room. So didn't expect to get a good score as I was writing it. :P 

 Product Strengths:

-Great mentors to be by your side and give you individual attention
-Wonderful Verbal Concepts course
-Great pool of questions reflecting actual GMAT standard in an organized manner so that you can curate your practice
-PACE enabled quant course to help you focus on subsections you need.

Would make the product better:

-Bigger pool of quant hard questions as most of the GMAT qns are of that difficulty.
-SMEs give timely responses, but the responses are not always helpful. But I enjoyed reading all the previous doubts/conversations from other students and even most of the responses from the SMEs are good.
-Revisit the actual content of the qns. I encountered qns that confirm to gender stereotypes which was a bit disheartening. I did mention this to the team citing specific examples. They responded positively and said they will look into it. So I'm hopeful this will change soon :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on the hard-earned 720! What a journey it has been, and I am proud to have been a part of it😊 

I must really commend you on how having recognized that verbal is where you require help improving, you set about learning the concepts and applications. This image shows the amount of time that you spent laying a solid foundation in SC: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/maria96-Excelled-in-Subject-Verbs  

Running against the clock, you skipped the crucial step on mastering your application by working on GMAT-like questions through cementing and had to settle for a lower-than-expected score on the GMAT in your first attempt.  

But as they say, it is human to falter, but it is the winners who learn from their mistakes and come out victorious. Now having recognized the importance of mastering the application, you set about building your ability by solving GMAT-like questions in scholaranium. See how this helped you transform from a person for whom “SC was a nightmare” to a person who improved to a 90th%ile ability in SC: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/maria96s-90-percentile-ability-in-SC  

Even in CR, which you knew was your strong area, you focussed on identifying and working on your weaknesses to build a rock-solid ability. See how this approach helped you improve to a 95th%ile ability in Assumptions while reducing the overall time to 1 min 42 sec for hard questions: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/maria96s-accuracy-vs-time-in-CR 

In quant, you leveraged the P.A.C.E. engine to focus on your weak areas and this helped you save 43 hours of study time 

Maria, I am sorry that you found the forum response not very helpful but please note that you can always, follow it up with another question to solve any further doubts that you might have. Also, we have taken your feedback on gender stereotypes and would like to tell you that it was not in anyways intentional, and we shall look into it.  

If I must describe the key indicators that helped in your GMAT journey in a line they would be – sheer grit, determination, and focussed efforts😊 I am sure the future has wonderful things in store for you and wish you all the best for all your future endeavours.

																			by score report","Points","Location","When I started my Gmat preparation, I thought I don’t need any coaching as I have previously aced many exams by doing self-study. I prepared using OG questions and free sources available online. I finished my prep and started giving mock exams just to realize that my score was fluctuating between 660 and 700 and even my highest score was nowhere near to my desired score.  I had no idea how to improve my score further and that’s when I decided that I need some professional help. 
I started reading the reviews of various courses available and after thorough research I decided to go for e-gmat. I Knew that being non-native English speaker, I don’t have ear for the right answer. But being engineer, I was logically strong and that’s what e-gmat’s approach is based on. Instead of mugging the rules and then relying on ear, they have structured, step-by-step and logical approach to solve the questions. Their meaning-based approach magically improved my SC score. Now, instead of my Achilles' heel, it became my strong point where I could save time to utilize on tougher CR questions. I was already good at CR, but their pre-thinking approach helped me fasten the process of question solving. For RC, I tried various approaches from fast reading to slow reading. But either my accuracy was suffering, or I was taking too long to solve the questions. E-Gmat’s reading strategy helped me find the sweet spot of solving question with good accuracy and in optimal time. after solidifying my concepts, I moved towards solving more and more questions. E-Gmat’s Scholaranium was pretty useful in this regard. Each question was followed by detailed answers and many had detailed video solutions. Even after going through the solution, I sometimes had few more doubts. I did post those doubts and e-gmat’s team was quick enough to reply them. Their Sigma-X mock tests were also helpful in assessing the ability.
Towards the end, I opted for their last mile program, in which a dedicated expert overviewed my progress, strategy, and weaknesses and suggested personalized improvement plans. The expert even overviewd my progress till the actual gmat exam. This further helped me to improve my confidence and score. All these efforts helped me achieve a score of 740 (Q50 V40).
Even during my preparation, many of my friends asked me for prep tips and I told them just to blindly follow the e-gmat course. I would give same advice to everyone. I hope this review would help more of my fellow aspirants.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","0","0","","","January 24, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear AkashYewale,   

Congratulations on the 740! With this, you are among the top 3% of the GMAT test-takers. What an achievement! It has been a pleasure working with you in this journey toward excellence.  

As you have rightly said, SC is not just about rules and grammar. It is the logical application of certain fundamental processes that will help you consistently answer all types of SC questions with good accuracy. See how internalizing this logical ‘Meaning-based approach’ helped transform your ‘Achilles Heel’ to your armour by helping improve to a 75% + accuracy across all topics in SC: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/AkashYewales-excellent-SC-ability  

Recognizing that there were timing issues in CR that needed to be addressed, you started from the foundation up and mastered the pre-thinking approach by working on GMAT-like questions on scholaranium . See how this structured attitude helped you improve to 90th%ile ability in CR while helping reduce overall time for hard questions to 1 min 48 sec.  

https://success.e-gmat.com/AkashYewales-CR-accuracy-vs-timing  

I appreciate how you recognized that the biggest challenge in RC is to “find the sweet spot of solving questions in optimal time with good accuracy.” Having done this, by working on your reading strategies, you were able to find this balance and excel in RC.  

Rome was not built in a day – similarly, excellence is not achieved through a single quiz. It is an iterative process where you need to review each question to find those incremental improvement areas. I am glad that through reviewing the solutions – both in quizzes and mocks – you were able to strategically work towards solidifying your ability.  

You are a prime example of how you do not need to be a native speaker to ace the GMAT verbal. 

I am so happy that all the effort paid off! I, on the behalf of the entire e-GMAT family, wish you all the best in this new journey that you have embarked upon.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:Course content and structure, learning methodologies and processes like SC meaning-based approach or CR pre-thinking, personalized study plans and great analysis tools into sub-section abilities, and finally, their 1:1 support as part of the last mile programI began preparing for the GMAT very late in the game for Round 2 applications this year and e-GMAT is the sole reason I was able to achieve my target (nay, dream) score. I would blindly recommend to anyone and everyone regardless of your starting level and here's why: 
1) Course structure: with so many different resources to choose from online, not to mention the countless test-prep publishers, it can get a little overwhelming deciding what to study and that's where I really appreciated the e-GMAT modular course structure which has both breadth of everything you need to know and also depth (tons of practice questions and video lessons) in whichever areas you seek to improve
2) Course content: in my opinion, the learning content and unique approach to certain sections of the test has clearly been developed over years and is second to none. For example, the meaning-based approach to SC, pre-thinking in CR and the invaluable process skills in Quant 
3) Quality of questions and analysis tools: I only covered about 25% of the total number of questions available on the platform and yet was able to expose myself to almost every little trick the GMAT test makers may use. Scholaranium 2.0 is awesome and after you guys are done with the learning modules, this should be where you spend most of your team and do most of your learning (and score improving!). Further, their analysis tools to judge your ability based on your performance in not just a subsection (say Algebra) but even more granular (like simplifying algebraic expressions or solving quadratic equations) and therefore you know where to improve your accuracy to achieve your target sectional (and sub-sectional) scores/ability
4) Last and perhaps the biggest reason for my to recommend e-GMAT is their hyper-personalized learning plans and the 1:1 support I received as part of the Last Mile Program. Rashmi was a not just a constant source of support and helped me maintain discipline, but also drafted my study plan personalized based on my initial mock test and then every few weeks into it would check in and make adjustments if needed. I felt the same level of motivation and commitment from the other e-GMAT mentors that I have interacted with and am positive that you all will be better-off for having their support.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","10","1","","","January 24, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear adidixit10,

This mail from you captures the ecstasy that you must have felt seeing the score pop-up on the screen: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/joy-of-scoring-770  

What stands out in the entire journey is your diligence towards the preparation and the willingness and determination to learn from every question that you solved.  

You left no stone unturned. Recognizing that SC is one of your weaker areas in verbal, you set about learning all the concepts and applications. Once done with that you practiced on the scholaranium questions to build your ability. See how this structured approach helped you breeze through the hard cementing quizzes helping you improve to the 95th %ile ability in SC: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/SC-cementing-quizzes-predict-90-percentile  

In CR, you were starting out at a higher ability. But when you recognized that the process that you were using wasn’t delivering consistent results, using the analytics on the platform you identified your weak areas and diligently fixed them. See how with this data-driven approach you were able to transform the ‘Assumption’ block in CR to one of your strengths: 

https://success.e-gmat.com/adidixit10s-accuracy-in-assumption-block  

As you have rightly mentioned, given the time constraints, you did not have time to practice a lot of questions. But you made every question count by spending substantial time reviewing the solutions and learning from them. This iterative approach of learning from your mistakes helped you improve to the top 1% in verbal.  

Even in quants, you leveraged the feedback-driven system and were able to improve from a Q47 to a Q49 in a matter of one week. Congratulations on that😊  

adidixit10, the qualities that you have displayed during your preparation are the ones that characterize a winner, and I am sure you will go on to achieve great things in your future.  

I wish you all the best for your forthcoming interviews from all your dream b-schools.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Advantages of e-GMAT are that it has a vast question bank built by experts and you can attempt quizzes in a timed manner. Timing strategy is as important as knowing all the technical know-how for acing the GMAT. Practicing quizzes in a timed environment helped me build stamina for the exam. The customization feature for quizzes allowed me to cement my weaker sections – especially in SC, where I was having quite some trouble handling Modifier questions. Also, the fundamental approach for SC – understanding meaning, CR – pre-thinking and RC- summarizing the passage before jumping onto questions, helped me solve questions in a structured and confident way.

But undoubtedly the best part of e-GMAT is the LMP program which pairs you with a mentor who supports you to build a roadmap by analyzing your test results. I was lucky to work with Aakash, who was very supportive and always available to help solve any difficulties I had in planning the study schedule. Being a full time professional, it is easy to get derailed from the actual schedule but thanks to the mentor-based approach, I was able to stay focused and complete the course modules and quizzes on time. Whenever my scores could not hit the target, Aakash always made a point to provide me with reference lectures to work on my skills. The study plans also took into consideration my time commitment and were flexible enough to allow time for revision and analysis.

To give a bit more context, I had used a self-study approach in the first attempt and scored a 710 (V36, Q50). Quant was relatively a strong area for me but I had no clue where it was going wrong in Verbal. Hence, I decided to give e-GMAT a try. I had roughly a month to practice and solved all the Verbal modules. But I somehow managed to score only a 700. Maybe it was the pressure or just a bad day. I had planned to apply in R2 and gave the second attempt around mid-Oct. But scoring only 700, I was hopeless about applying to any of the target schools I had in mind. However just to get a hang of the application process I decided to apply to one school and when the bulk of the application was over, I still had around 2 – 3 weeks left on my hands. I decided to give GMAT one more try after getting some encouragement from my mentor at e-GMAT. He assured me that I had all the skills necessary and only needed to work on giving the test with a calm mind. For the 2 weeks, he prepared a fine-tuned plan targeted specially at my weak points, accommodating the time constraint I had due to my job and the application. Third time was a charm and I got through scoring a 750.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=36#","0","0","","","January 23, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear ru345,

Excellent for someone who is starting the GMAT prep from scratch.Would make the product better:Total no of Sigma x mocks could be increased.I started my GMAT journey with e-GMAT on 15th March 2022. I came to know about e-GMAT through my friends who were also preparing for GMAT. Before joining e-GMAT, I reviewed other courses and found that e-GMAT is less expensive and has delivered better result than other courses available online. I decided to use a trial version of e-GMAT just to be sure of my decision. One thing that stood out for me in the trial version was how both quant and verbal concepts are taught from scratch. I was fully satisfied with what I saw in the trial version and decided to go for e-GMAT course.
Here is my detailed review of both Verbal and Quant course:
Verbal:
Like a typical Indian engineer’s verbal ability, my verbal ability was very poor from the beginning. I knew that I had to work both hard and smart to get a good score in verbal. e-GMAT provided me a perfect platform for just that. 
Regarding sentence correction (SC), every concept, starting from verb to modifiers and idioms, was taught from the scratch in e-GMAT. These concepts were also taught in structured format through well -explained videos. After each and every concept, there is an evaluation test based on that concept to test your skill on the concept. Each and every question in the evaluation test is very well explained through videos or written analysis by Subject Matter Expert (SME). This helped in clearing a lot of doubts regarding SC. Also, e-GMAT focuses on meaning-based approach in SC. This approach increased my accuracy significantly and reduced my time for answering questions as I was able to eliminate the answers based on meaning of questions. 
After one is done with SC, there are cementing quizzes, which tests your knowledge on the the concepts learned in the SC. These are medium and hard difficulty level quizzes. e-GMAT, through videos, guides the students on how to effectively use these cementing quizzes without exhausting question bank. e-GMAT also guides a student on how to maintain error logs. Remember, it is important one maintains an error log as it helps in identifying the weakness and strength.
Talking about CR and RC, both are also taught from the very basic. In CR, pre thinking approach is used for solving questions. This approach saved a lot of time and improved my accuracy significantly. All type of questions, from assumption to boldface, are explained in detail and in a structured format in e-GMAT by SME. For me, improving my CR skills did a lot of wonders. Once my CR skills improved, I observed that my RC skills were also improving as I was able to understand the RC questions easily and eliminate the wrong choices easily.
Each of CR and RC is followed by cementing quizzes, which helps in strengthening the base and building your confidence on your own verbal abilities.
I highly recommend the verbal course to someone who wants to score more than 700 in GMAT with a good verbal score
Quant:
As I am from engineering background, I was confident in my quant abilities. e-GMAT took my quant abilities to next level in a very short amount of time. e-GMAT has interesting feature called PACE engine. This feature enables one to customize the course and saves a lot of time. In my case, I was able to cover the entire quant course in half the time because of this feature. Each and every concept is taught from very basic and gradually difficulty level increases. Generally, quant questions in e-GMAT are of higher difficulty level as compared to official GMAT. Students who do well in e-GMAT quant course will have no problem in answering quant questions in official GMAT exams.
 If one wants to score equal to or more than Q49 in official GMAT, I highly recommend the e-GMAT quant course.
Sigma X Mocks:
Once, I was done with my quant and verbal course, I started giving Sigma mocks. These mocks are adaptive and pretty close to official GMAT. ESR + analysis feature allows you to identify weakness and strength in different quant and verbal section. These mocks are an effective way to track your progress and learn about the improvement areas during the preparation.
I recommend that you take full advantage of the Sigma-X mock tests if you have subscribed to the e-GMAT way.
Overall, my experience with the course was excellent and I highly recommend it to someone who is starting from the scratch.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=37#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Heartiest Congratulations to you on your 710 score!   

A colossal 110-point improvement is a dream for many, and you are one of those very few who was able to accomplish this dream on the very first attempt. I applaud you for your efforts that allowed you to achieve this score of 710 (90th percentile) from a starting score of 600 (50th percentile).  

You enhanced your SC and CR abilities by internalizing the ‘Meaning-based approach for SC’ and ‘Pre-thinking approach for CR’.

I was highly satisfied with the E-GMAT products and services.Hi everyone. I'm Jab from Thailand. I went through up and down and up again throughout my GMAT journey. And I have a lot to share with you today, hoping that none of you will make the same mistake I did.

It began in 2019 when I followed my friend to take my first GMAT exam. I went straight to the exam without preparation because I was confident that I could make it through quickly. Needless to say, it went horribly wrong. I severely underestimated the exam, thinking it was similar to SAT.

After online research and discussions with my friends, I realized that I need professional support tutoring services, but I need to stay in my full-time employment. An online tutoring platform like E-GMAT became my most reasonable option. 

E-GMAT has one of the most structured and rich GMAT preparation contents. It's arguably more impressive than the official GMAT prep. They have personalized study plans, intelligent algorithms, giant question banks, and detailed explanations for any answer you may want. The contents are arranged in perfect order, making them easy to follow and digest. They have a realistic quiz engine and mock exam to sharpen your examination skill. My first mistake was that I utilized none of them efficiently.

At that time, I was invested in my full-time job and couldn't prepare for extra hours to study GMAT diligently. I thought that by practicing the exercise as much as I could, I could go on just fine without sticking to the plan. After all, the quantitative and verbal sessions were at the first-year college level, right? Thinking that I could apply my previous lessons in college to answer the official GMAT questions was a mistake, and it cost me greatly. My second test a few months later went as terribly as my first. Something has to change.

I decided to prepare GMAT by taking a two-month leave, so I could entirely focus on it. I sailed through half of the question bank and wrote notes on all the topics I got wrong. I also checked out some of the OG questions in the GMAT Club. I even organized a study group with my friends so that I left no stone unturned. My confidence improved when I saw my mock exam score improve to the mid-600 level. My third exam was a disappointment, still. The stress kept me from thinking critically. The average time spent was nowhere close to my practice time. Poor stress management was my second mistake.

My time was running out, and I was out of the idea of doing it alone. So I seek professional advice by emailing the E-GMAT strategy Expert team. I thought they would mock my insignificant score, so I was skeptical. But they were accommodating. First, they analyzed my performance and revision activities from the E-GMAT account, then created a personalized improvement plan tailored to the time I had left. I remembered telling them I had four months to get from 630 to ~700 level in a predictable manner. Our goal was clear, and we went on the spartan mode.

At this stage, the essential point is my own diligence. If the execution were lacking, the plan would have failed regardless. I steeled myself and disappeared from social media. I first revised my mistake by looking at the practice quiz and fixing weak parts instead of going through everything. Then came the cementing quiz and strategic review. I cannot stress enough how vital these two activities were because only by focusing on solidifying your conceptual gap would I then be able to say that I can do it confidently.

Following the plan we set up diligently was not only helpful in aceing the GMAT exam but also calmed down my nerve when I walked into the actual exam room. This time, I felt I had done everything I could and managed my stress well. The result was far better than I had hoped.

I improved by 60 points from 630 (V31, Q46) to 690 (V40, Q44) just because I let go of my arrogance and studied diligently. I trusted that the E-GMAT team knew the proper method and followed their guide. The journey could have been shorter and more manageable.

If I could turn back time and give myself some advice, I would say...
Plan your study in a structured and actionable manner. Refrain from trying to brute force your way through.
Stress clouds your judgment. It would be best if you learned to manage it well.
If you ever feel stuck, seek advice from experts. You would be surprised at how willing they are to guide you.

And if you don't know where to start, I highly recommend contacting E-GMAT team.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=37#","0","0","","","January 13, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi peerachat, 

Congratulations on 690! 

A 9-point Verbal improvement from V31(51st percentile) to V40(90th percentile) is highly commendable and the diligence and grit that you have shown in your journey is truly inspirational!  

When I look back at your journey, the one thing that stands out is, from day one, you did not shy away from hard work.  

You put in all the necessary hours to build a strong foundation by learning the concepts and applications, strategically reviewing the quizzes, identifying the mistakes, and taking the corrective actions. Look at the image below to understand how diligently you reviewed to get to 100% accuracy in the CR practice quizzes.

I am glad that you mentioned the importance of the cementing stage and reviewing the quizzes and how important these were in helping you to identify your weak areas and master even the most difficult questions. 

You completed each step on the way with utmost sincerity and attention to detail to such an extent that you made following the right approach second nature to you. In SC, you internalized the meaning-based approach, which in turn helped you improve your accuracy and maintain your timing. 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/peerachat-SC-ability-improved-to-90-percentile

The focused approach that you took towards your preparations, by setting aside everything else and, giving it your all to the GMAT preparations is highly commendable. 

It is evident you loved the experience of the program. However, any program is only successful when the student gives their all.  

The journey was possible because you made sure you stay focused and trusted the process. It paid off, and, paid off well!

My mentor Abha Mohan was fantastic, she guided me with the steps needed to ace the test. The guidance was very structured. She would also track my progress and provide any course corrections if required. I genuinely appreciate her detailed feedback on my account and ESR for my retake. I was really amazed by this personal touch. Kudos to her for that.

The support team of e-GMAT is very prompt and collaborative. When my mentor was unavailable, they made sure that some other expert replied promptly. During my first attempt, they were very kind to extend my course for a few days free of cost. During the second attempt, a 1-month extension was provided at a subsidized rate. 

Verbal Course:
The course is comprehensive and has all that we need to ace the test. e-GMAT has the best verbal experts. Harsha for CR, Shradha, and Stacey for SC, Payal, and Kanupriya all-round. Their Pre thinking and meaning-based approach do work but require some time to make it intuitive. 
My tip is always to feel free to send an email to the support with your queries and use the in-built forum. 

Quant Course:
Surprisingly, the quant course of e-GMAT is even better than the verbal course. With the introduction of 'PACE' and diagnostic quizzes, one can customize the course and complete it faster. Swetha is the best Quant instructor in my opinion. 

Scholoranium and Sigma X mocks:
The questions are modeled very closely on the official GMAT Prep questions and are of high quality. 
The mocks are the best and close to the real thing. The analytics are great. Please don't forget to use the 'Skill data' part of the course to understand and ace your weaknesses. 

Areas of improvement:
My suggestion to the e-GMAT team is to include the error log feature inbuilt into the course, instead of filling all the already available data again in the excel sheet. I felt this part to be tedious. 
Also, include a feature to track progress or time spent, etc. Please provide video explanations and written explanations of all the solutions. 
In addition, the RC course can be further improved. Please come out with something like 'PACE' for the verbal course as well. 

Overall the course is value for your money.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=37#","4","0","","","March 22, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear DeepakMBA22,

4. Sigma Mock analysis:
Once you finish any mock as guided by mentors, you will get in dept personalized test review. The review is crisp, insightful, and full of self reflection points.Would make the product better:If anything, there is one point that can be improved. When I review any quiz in Scholaranium, I can straight away see the correct and/or incorrect answer choices. It is okay if I am reviewing the test just after completing it. However, if I am reviewing during revision or after some time, it would be great if I can only see the answer choices without the correct or incorrect answer choice. Adding a button such as “show answer” to unravel the correct answer choice can provide one an opportunity to recollect the thought process that one may have utilised while attempting the question without	 getting biased about correct and/or incorrect answer choice. It would have increased my error log quality, I believe.Instead of writing review, I reckon that writing my journey will make more sense to get the idea about the course. I am a non native English speaker, and my schooling was in vernacular language. So, my verbal section required special attention. 

It was my second e-GMAT subscription. My first subscription was purchased in July 2020. To be honest, I completely ruined that subscription by randomly going through the course and by not following strategic cementing process. I assumed that going through the course would be sufficient to get a reasonably good score. I ended up scoring a 590 (Q49 V21) in December 2020.

My learning from the whole experience was that GMAT is not the test of concept but rather it is the test of reasoning and processing. If the concepts are not commissioned with proper process, they are of no use as far as GMAT is concerned. 
I enrolled for the second time in June 2022. This time I was clear for at least what not to do. This time I followed the guidelines by the course and the mentors from the beginning to the end before adding my rational to a particular topic/section. Earlier I used to challenge the thought process that is being taught in the course by contending that the “eGMAT process following algorithm” takes longer than my method. Doing so hindered my learning in the previous attempt. 

Preparation beginning:
Attempted a sigma X mock. Assessed my ground level. Prepared a PSP - an overall outlook of how long should it take to reach test readiness.
2. I started with Verbal and then moved to Quant. (Reason: I am better at quant than at Verbal. Building ability takes time. It is a good idea to give yourself sufficient time to make the process application your second nature before taking GMAT)

For Verbal:
Master Comprehension >> SC >> CR >> RC
Meaning based approach in SC and Pre-thinking method in CR are game changer. If followed the process in right way, majority of the questions can be solved with relative ease. However, it is not easy to get acquainted to these process if you cut the corners at understanding level. 
First, I finished all the course content and made proper notes in such a way that if I want to refer to a particular topic after a few time I can go back quickly and connect with that topic.
Finished cementing stage for each subsection as instructed in “Yes loop algorithm” of Cementing Process. Moved to next step after validating progress from the mentors.
After Cementing, I followed instruction of Abha/Akash (Mentors) for Test readiness stage.
Mentors actively asked me to revise the older learning along with learning new things. The idea is not to lose on what we have earlier gained.
Prepared an extensive error log as instructed by Mentors.

For Quant:

PACE is a beautifully crafted Quant course. The concept and process diagnostics in the beginning of the section gave me a fair idea about how prepared I am and where should I focus particularly. It saved me a lot of time. I finished the quant course in 16 days with full time job.
It teaches how to decode the question statement to understand what exactly is asked. It has helped me in understanding complex problems with relative ease. 
It is a myth that e-GMAT quant is tougher than the actual quant that is being tested in GMAT. Sometimes, the question statement length is overwhelming in cementing state. However, the requirement is to score 5-6 question correct out of 10 such question. In sigma X mock, medium and hard questions are perfectly balanced and are of similar spectrum of what GMAT tests.

Overall:
The cementing stage is, I believe, the most important tool to increase our basic abilities. Mentors repeatedly state the same, and now I understand the reason behind it. Once I finished stage 2 cementing stage, I asked all my process related doubts to the mentors in form of long extensive emails, and all my queries were addressed by Abha/Akash/e-GMAT team. In the last 3 weeks of my GMAT test, I informed the mentors about my calendar and my commitments. Abha/Akash/Mentors gave me a proper plan to follow for test readiness and Mock schedule. There were times when I felt low, and these mentor made sure I don’t lose faith in myself. 

I scored 680 in my last sigmaX mock and 700 & 720 in my official GMAT mocks. As far as I could understand, Official GMAT mocks did not feel like an adaptive test. On the other hand, Sigma X mocks are actually adaptive. Increased difficulty level question on the later stage of the test is quite challenging under timed environment.  I scored a 680 (Q49 V34) in actual GMAT, and I felt quite similar to Sigma X mock experience. I am in the process in deciding whether to re attempt GMAT or not.

Overall, it was a good learning experience. If I compare my current work emails with my earlier emails, I see a vast difference in the way I write and in the way I read anything. It will not be exaggeration if I claim that eGMAT approach has not just increased the test taking ability but also increased the overall reasoning ability.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=37#","0","0","","","January 13, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi pchimanshu27,

Verbal and quant are both broken down into topics and the tutors on eGMAT focus on helping the student break down each module and come up with a logical and easy-to-follow way to solve them, while still retaining the basic core idea of each module.

The mentorship process is also very innovative - it allows the student to learn at their own pace while also giving enough time for the mentor to review your query and give a detailed response.

My mentor for the process was Dhruv Joshi and he helped keep me honest - we did disagree on the approach to take for a few sub-sections but Dhruv's brutal honestly helped me identify what I needed to improve on.Would make the product better:While the mentors are helpful in responding to the students, sometimes a student may need a personal touch or reassurance when things may not be going so well or it would help the student clarify a doubt by verbal communication.

At present, eGMAT only offers mentor responses over email and a call feature could be one of the things added to improve eGMAT's already impressive methodology of teaching.Overall, eGMAT has aced the process of helping a student ace the GMAT exam, which in itself can be daunting and more so for working professionals, who may not have studied formally for a few years and need to get into that mindset of studying again.

eGMAT's tiered break-down of sections helps immensely in that regard and their PACE time savings method in the quant helps the student identify their strengths and subsequently reduce their preparation time.

Good balance with cost, it isn't prohibitively expensive.A quick brief of my GMAT journey:
I had been on and off with my Gmat prep since 2018, life, international job opportunity, and many other things got in the way.
However I finally committed to appearing for gmat in 2021, and scored 700. Though this isn't a bad score considering the colleges that I was interested in and my profile it wasn't sufficient. I got rejections most of the T20 MBAs.
So a. year later I appeared again around mid August and scored 680, so I cancelled my score. This probably was my lowest point as most of my mocks were above 700.
Upon reviewing my performances and ESR I realized the issue was with verbal, particularly SC. I did pretty good in CR/RC. I had previously used free resources of e-GMAT (from youtube and gmatclub forum), and based on that experience decided to go for e-GMAT subscription. Another reason to to choose e-gmat was their price point, I did not intend on spending too much on a course that I would use just for a few topics/weeks.

e-GMAT usage:
As the R1 deadlines appeared I only had about 4 weeks to reappear. So I took the e-GMAT course to bridge my verbal knowledge. I have been a fluent english speaker since childhood, however it is mainly conversational fluency. When it came to using rules to distinguish between options I would bank on ""does this sound right"" and various tricks and techniques. It was clear that I had exhausted the potential of these strategies and I had to bridge the fundamental knowledge.

This is where the e-GMAT's structured course really helped me. Particularly using the diagnostics I could skip the sections over which I had mastery, e.g. comparisons. This enabled me to fast-track my preparation in the short window of opportunity. 

The explanations of fundamental concepts were also quite rational and logical. Up until then I considered grammar to be some sort of magic/alchemy, particularly when it came to modifiers. But through their explanations I could see the rule-based nature. This knowledge paired with my ""conversational fluency"" was a potent combination that enabled me to score so well during my third attempt (750) which got me into T15 MBA's.

I did not use the quant tutorials as I was pretty confidant on these topics. I only used the quant question bank. I liked the customizability and difficulty-adaptability of the question bank.

One more thing to highlight about the question bank, since I had attempted GMAT twice I had exhausted all the questions from official question banks. This was a bigger issue for verbal than quant and CR/RC questions were essentially corrupted. I liked that e-GMAT questions were not a repeat of the official question bank and it gave me new questions to practice on.

In the end I would heavily recommend e-GMAT to anyone who wants to change their Verbal game fundamentally, whatever knowledge level you are at!

Congratulations on the 750 – a score achieved by just the top 2% of the test-takers!!! A feat made more commendable with a 50-point improvement in just 4 weeks.   

I really appreciate how you went about improving from 700. You analysed your performance to understand where the improvement was to come from – Sentence Correction.  

Having identified this, you decided a ‘sounds right’ approach will just not cut it in SC and spent considerable time building your foundations by learnings concepts and applications. See how you were able to achieve near-perfect scores in the foundational modules of Subject-Verb with your diligence: 
https://success.e-gmat.com/razerblade-subject-verb-accuracy  

Having done this, you mastered your applications on GMAT-like questions in Scholaranium to be able to consistently answer SC questions of all difficulty levels. I am glad that this diligent and methodical approach helped you get to the top 6%ile in verbal.  

The journey from good to great is not easy. If anything, it is more difficult than the journey to good. But you have shown that once one sets their eyes on something and is unwilling to settle for anything but the best, great feats are achieved😊 

I am sure this never-say-die attitude will help you reach greater heights in your future.  

On behalf of the entire e-GMAT family, I wish you all the best for all your future endeavours.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Strengths:1. Structured 
2. Concise 
3. Easy to use 
4. Customizable Would make the product better:Nothing much to improve but something that can be adapted - 
It would be great if some discounts can be offered for the financially disadvantaged yet diligent student to help the overall student community! An online educational platform is deemed a great one if its content, user interface, and adaptability can help students conquer their goals in a structured yet fluidic manner. 

This is where e-GMAT surpassed my expectations. 
 
To begin with, I’ll break the GMAT exam into its two major components – 
1.	Verbal Section
2.	Quant Section 

The Verbal Section – e-GMAT’s methodology to ace the SC section involves comprehending the meaning of the sentences followed by applying the correct grammatical rules. This technique, made simpler with the plethora of GMAT-styled questions, helped me reach 90%+ accuracy. The entire SC module has been deconstructed into shorter videos, which, when followed in chronological order, help summarize every nuance within this section. The SC module is then followed by the CR modules, in which specialized techniques such as the pre-thinking approach, variance test, ABC tests et. al. help the student view every CR question in a much more systematic manner. Once a student is familiar with these methods, the RC section begins to appear reasonably easier to tackle. 
Verbal Scholaranium is e-GMAT’s collection of handpicked verbal questions that are at par or can be considered a notch harder than the current GMAT test questions. If one is able to utilize this adequately, the person will surely excel in the Verbal section of the GMAT exam.

The Quant Section – As I’m relatively comfortable with the quant section, I questioned the learning process during my preparation. Why am I supposed to go through the basics? Will it not waste my time? This is where P.A.C.E kicks in! 
P.A.C.E is e-GMAT’s proprietary algorithm, which helps the student chart out their preparation plan based on the diagnostic tests attempted. Hence, a student who is relatively stronger in a certain section within the quants module will be in a position to skip those particular files. 
This helped me ‘pace’ my preparation. The quality of questions in the Scholaranium is exceptional (though relatively difficult compared with the actual GMAT questions) and these questions helped my Q48 improve to a Q50! 

For someone who is inherently a poor test-taker, multiple customizable quizzes helped me prepare for the actual exam. This, coupled with the 5 Sigma-X Mock Tests helped me prepare my test-taking strategies. The Sigma-X mocks are an accurate representation of the actual exam. One can expect a +/- 10/20 points deviation in their official scores. 

Lastly, no platform is complete without the human touch. My mentor, Rida Shafeek, and her colleagues were extremely helpful in guiding and motivating me for my exam. There were days when I would be mentally exhausted and physically drained. However, her constant support in charting out a hyper-specific time-bound preparation plan helped me power my 640 to a whopping 760! I’d highly recommend e-GMAT to every GMAT aspirant out there. A solid 10/10!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=37#","9","0","","","January 11, 2023","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey akash812,

The SC sub-section focuses on a meaning-based approach which really helped me to increase my accuracy to 80+%ile. This approach further helps as the difficulty of the questions increases. The pre-thinking approach in CR was a game-changer for me, wherein the course instils the process skill required to pre-think weakener/strengthener etc and this approach helps to eliminate the incorrect options quickly. The RC subsection focuses on strategies required to ace complex RC passages on the GMAT such as focussed-Reading strategies. The QUANT course although a little too hard, covers each and every topic in detail and provides ample practice on every sub-topic. The Pace AI further helped me to skip topics which I was already comfortable with.

Maybe we can have more personalized content and support for the group aiming to score higher 760 or higher.E-GMAT was my savior when I needed help the most. I started my GMAT prep in the month of April '22. I hired one of the tutors (would like the keep it anonymous). I was given a content ramp-up plan of ~4 months and then a month of mock practice and it was expected that I would be able to crack the exam in the south of ~6 months. 

Days passed by. I gave in the required time, finished the content, and attempted my first mock (Official practice test 1). I got a 720 - This was the best score I would get among the mocks to come, and, yes, I attempted quite a few of them. The entire month of august, I wrote 1 mock per week with the delusion that I have mastered what is there to master in the content and it was just a matter of time before I get my target score of 750. Reality check, after around 6 mocks, 720 was still my best score. I even got a few scores of sub-700. I tried reaching out to my mentors but received no help whatsoever. 

Enter E-GMAT the savior. Disappointed with my performance, I decided to take a week off from my prep and went to home in the first week of September. I was stressed out and clueless. Then I got in touch with folks at e-GMAT. Appeared for the first sigma mock and got a 700. Now, our goal was clear, get a 750 in about 2 months' time. 

I started with E-GMAT on the 19th of September.  They really helped me out in identifying my weak areas in the Verbal section and filling in the gaps. Most importantly, the mentor (Ms. Abha Mohan) instilled in confidence within me that I can actually hit the 750-740 mark consistently. 

The organized content, the proactive support from the mentors' team, the methodical approach to both the Verbal and Quant sections, the Excellent content for both Quant and Verbal, and the Sigma-X Mock Tests helped me a lot!

The Verbal section specially had a very methodical approach, with clear strategies and techniques for tackling each type of question. This helped me approach the questions with more confidence and ultimately improve my performance. The pedagogy for solving SC questions were extremely effective, meaning based approach to each sentence correction really makes a lot of difference while solving medium to hard questions. The core skills such as identifying grammatical errors, understanding meaning, and answer choices analysis got firmly built due to the course. The CR part was excellent in terms of understanding the different parts of an argument, the different kinds of questions that can be asked and mainly getting to know the traps involved in official GMAT questions. eGMAT gave me an altogether different strategy in for tackling CR: “Pre thinking”, this approach has worked wonders for me. From starting with very low accuracy right to getting all of them right has been an incredible experience. The RC course was good for learning the way to understand any given passage, and increasing retention while reading anything.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi Reader, 

Here is my long journey to a 730 GMAT score. Please bear with me! First off, I am immensely grateful for the support of e-GMAT team throughout this journey. 

I started to think about the GMAT back in May 2021, and attempted the first free OG mock. I scored a 670 on the test and thought that I am at a pretty decent score and underestimated how tough it would be to improve the score. Not knowing much about the GMAT Prep space, I took a Magoosh subscription but was not impressed with it in the first few days itself. I felt that the lessons were not comprehensive enough. When I gave the second free OG mock test in the end of June, I scored a 690. I felt this was not a good enough improvement.

So I began to look for other resources on GMAT Prep. I attended a GMAT strategy session and booked a free strategy call with one of the experts. I was convinced that e-GMAT are experts in the GMAT prep space and bought the GMAT Online focused subscription. I started with Verbal and was able to witness gradual improvement across all the subsections.Thanks to e-GMAT’s cementing process, I was able to track my progress in an efficient manner. 

From August ’21 to May ’22, I was not able to focus my energies on the GMAT prep due to excessive work responsibilities. Due to the extension policies set by e-GMAT (max. 90 days of account freeze allowed), I had to keep the subscription going for most of this time period. This rigid account suspension timeline is the only drawback that I have observed with e-GMAT’s subscriptions.

Starting June ’22, I was able to refocus on the GMAT prep and started revising the Verbal modules I had previously completed. I was continuously scoring better on the mocks (700, 750, 740, 760) during this period. I gave my first GMAT Online attempt in Aug '22 and scored an underwhelming 680. I was unable to understand the reason because the mock tests had indicated my score to be in the mid 700s. This is when I reached out to e-GMAT seeking help to improve my score and understand where I am lacking. I also requested to be included in e-GMAT’s Last Mile Program (LMP), wherein one of the experts from e-GMAT works 1-1 with you to help you reach your target score. 

Rida from e-GMAT’s team helped me get enrolled into the LMP and we got to work immediately. She first helped me analyze what was wrong with my GMAT Online attempt, and then charted an intensive test-readiness plan for me to help my Verbal and Quant abilities. I was able to improve my abilities across the board and this was evident in my quizzes as well. She was very responsive to my queries and our regular connects to track the progress were of immense help to me. I was able to discuss any concerns or plan changes with her. 

The mocks during this time period were of immense help as they helped me get into the mindset of continued focus for greater periods of time. However, there were times when I scored 680 on a particular mock, primarily due to a weak Verbal Score. To help overcome these, Rida sent some session recordings and document links that were helpful to overcome my shortcomings. I also attempted the SC ability booster sessions that were moderated by Payal, and they helped me understand my level and refine my SC ability to a great extent. 

I gave the second GMAT Online attempt in Sept with a whole lot of confidence, but the result was to my utter shock! I had scored a 660, even lower than my first attempt. I was in complete disbelief as to what had just happened, but was more determined than ever to reach my target score. Rida helped me calm down, be positive and analyze the issues in the attempt. We found that I was feeling some level of performance anxiety during the attempts which was leading to suboptimal performance in the tests. We were confident on my abilities and just needed to build upon these to reach to a better score. 

Also, after this attempt, the work responsibilities increased which meant that I had lesser time to dedicate to prep. So Rida helped me with an appropriate test readiness plan that could be completed in the limited time I had. I only had 2 unattempted OG mocks left that I had to use judiciously. I scored 760 on both these tests, which was a huge confidence booster for me. 

Apart from the test, I also worked on developing a detached mindset and did not focus much on the score. Discussions with Rida were instrumental in this regard. We decided to have an in-person attempt this time because of the reason that it would be a much better environment to build focus rather than attempting the test at home. And sure enough, it was a good experience at the center. I was able to score a 730 on the test this time, which is much closer to my mock scores. 

The last few months have been a period of hard work and persistence. And I can’t thank Rida and the e-GMAT team enough for helping me throughout this process. I am confident that these are the best people in the business for anyone who wants to excel at GMAT. 

The Unique Aspects of e-GMAT that helped me:
1. PACE - PACE helped me in charting a streamlined Quant path by guiding me exactly where I need to spend my efforts. 
2. Meaning-based approach for SC - Although I was already relying on the meaning before I saw this first-hand in e-GMAT, the SC modules in e-GMAT helped me use this approach along with identifying the correct grammar and this led to immense improvement of SC scores.
3. Pre-thinking approach for RC and CR - The pre-thinking process has been a game changer for me. Earlier, I used to read the question and directly jump to the option choices. However, pre-thinking allows me to understand the question stem and get involved with the universe of the question. This helps me to understand what the option choices really mean. I am happy to state that my CR and RC scores have improved significantly by using this method.
4. Cementing - In my opinion, Cementing is a very unique strength of the e-GMAT program. It helps one truly gauge their ability in a particular subsection of Quant/ Verbal. It has been really helpful whenever I had to track my progress.
5. Expert support - What truly sets e-GMAT apart is that the team is relentlessly devoted to helping the students in the best way possible. These experts readily repspond to any student queries from a question doubt or strategy standpoint. I truly believe when I say that I would have been able to reach to my current level without the support of Rida and other experts at e-GMAT. 
6. Compassion towards the students - I was able to share any personal circumstances that were affecting my GMAT prep with Rida, and she was able to help navigate these circumstances. Together with Rida, I was able to identify the mental (test mindset) barriers that were preventing me from obtaining a good score on the first two attempts. The e-GMAT team is truly invested in the success of the students from all angles.
7. Last Mile Program (LMP) - This program is a godsend for students who have limited time to attempt the GMAT and are already at a decent ability. In my case, I was able to move through some of the topics in a swift manner. The test readiness quizzes that were integrated into my plan were really helpful in emulating the actual test questions. Also, Rida used to share some additional Verbal resources and recordings that helped me obtain that last push for the target scores. 
8. Sigma-X mock tests - Although I have not attempted any other tests other than Sigma-X mock tests and OG mock tests, I found that the questions and scoring algorithm from Sigma-X mock tests are very similar to those of OG mock tests. These were a good testing resource for me. 

Although this seems like a long sponsored endorsement for e-GMAT, that is absolutely not the case :) e-GMAT’s results and stats within the GMAT Prep industry speak for themselves. Infact, my journey is not yet complete, as I am gearing for my next GMAT attempt within the next few days. Wish me Luck!!

[UPDATE]: I went for the 5th attempt and was able to score a 740!! Rida helped me focus on test readiness and exam mindset for achieving this score. The 1-1 session with Verbal SME Harsha was instrumental in improving my Verbal score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=38#","0","0","","","November 04, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey tusharmrigwani,  

Hearty congratulations on the 730 score!   

As your mentor, working with you these past few months has been a wonderful experience- your attention to detail, focus on approach and drive to get to your target score all indicate that you will excel beyond measure at business school and beyond. 

Your ability to bounce back after a bad attempt, reassess the situation and willingness to work on a path to improvement is a testament to your innate strength of character. When you wrote the below after the 660, many in your position might choose to give up -

But you decided that you were far from done and worked hard to build the right framework to ace the test!   

I can see how much time and effort you have put into perfecting methodologies and working on timing. You spent time going through files multiple times so that you could perfect the minute aspects of a particular approach.   

This approach particularly helped you in SC, especially in modifiers, where you worked to improve both accuracy and timing, by perfecting the meaning-based approach.  

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Tusharmrigwani-SC-Improvement  

In CR as well, this process of method perfection helped you go beyond the 90th percentile. I can see how you reviewed each and every quiz, and leveraged the feedback given by the system. This allowed you to tackle every new quiz with a more nuanced understanding of the approach and thus attain 80% plus accuracy on hard questions, as shown below.  

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Tusharmrigwani-CR-90th-Percentile-Ability  

The mindset is truly one of the most important facets of being GMAT ready. You can work through all your weaknesses, and excel in mocks, but if you don’t have the right mix of confidence and detachment when you tackle the actual exam, you can set yourself up for failure. It's amazing how well you learnt from your second attempt in this regard.  

I am sure that you are going to absolutely kill it in your next attempt, and I am excited to continue to work with you in this endeavour!   

All the best!

However, the biggest strength of this product is the manner in which it endlessly prompts the student to follow a structured approach of solving questions in each of the different sections the GMAT.Would make the product better:The product is simply great in its current format. However, since the company itself has pampered its students by creating useful tools such as P.A.C.E. for the Quant section of test prep, the same or similar tool for Verbal would be great as well!Unlike other exams, the GMAT is not a test of how well you can remember formulas or how quickly you can solve a question. Rather it tests the students presence of mind and their ability to correctly interpret the question itself. And this is one quality consistent across all its sections. To be able to perform well in such an exam, it is imperative to understand its nuances and to internalise certain proven strategies that streamline the way a student approaches each question on the test.

The content offered by eGMAT as part of their GMAT prep courses does just that. It solidifies the basic Math and English fundamentals and then builds upon them to convert them into GMAT level Quant and Verbal. The Process Skills taught in the Quant modules, which are essentially techniques required to break down each Quant question to isolate the relevant data, are reiterated to the point where their application becomes second nature. In such a case, even the trickiest of questions lose their complexity. Next, the Cementing Quizzes at the end of each topic help in carrying out an objective assessment of the student’s assimilation of concepts and the corresponding Error Logs brilliantly highlight areas that need additional consideration.

For the Critical Reasoning subsection of Verbal, an elaborate module on Pre-Thinking ensures ample practice to perfect this acquired skill. And the highly interactive and engaging modules on Sentence Correction successfully cover even the most dry grammar topics in a fun and indelible manner. The vast repository of examples covered in each module brings absolute clarity in the application of concepts and provides enough opportunity to the student to bridge any gaps in understanding.

The quality that sets eGMAT apart is that it does not teach its students any shortcuts or tricks to tackle GMAT questions. Instead, it equips its students with the exact tools required to decode the GMAT exam and makes the overall experience of preparation a joyous one; where the student actively seeks hard questions to both apply his learnings and get them right, and to get an opportunity to uncover another trap in case they get it wrong. For the same reason, I would highly recommend eGMAT to any student in their own GMAT journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=38#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

"December 13, 2022","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","E-GMAT- a blessing in my journey!","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","","Location","I joined e-gmat after finishing another GMAT in-person course from an organization. After I had finished my first coaching and attempted an official mock, the results were shocking. Not only was the study material far from the required concepts, the methods used to teach were very generic and rudimentary.
GMAT is an adaptive test, and with the algorithm the test is based on, one must be prepared to:
- Handle questions by applying relevant concepts 
- Have a pacing-strategy in place
- Nurture the correct mind-set
These 3 points are the most basic requirements, and E-gmat gives just the right appreciation to there importance. After following the steps prescribed by the course and the mentors, I was able to score as high as: 
- 780 and 760 in official mocks 
- 760 in SIGMA-X mock
- 720 in my official attempt

THE COURSE:
E-gmat is, hands-down, one of the most targeted courses available anywhere in India and online. The subject matter taught is entirely relevant and not at all redundant. In fact, the course ensures that the needs of people from varied starting points are catered to. I belong to a non-math background and felt extremely lost as I proceeded with my initial coaching classes. But the Quant course of E-gmat walked me through the most basic concepts and made me reach complex concepts so fluently that I managed to score a Q50 in every Official Mock I took. Cementing Quiz feature especially comes in-handy to give you a realistic, non-starry check of your performance, which is an under-rated but super-important requirement for one’s journey. 

MY ADVICE: While the course does an amazing job in laying down all the concepts, it is also imperative that you keep on revising the taught concepts by re-visiting the concept/application files. It is your responsibility to ensure that you make the most out of the course. The course is a powerful weapon if you know how to use it. 
Further, the verbal course, especially verbal SC, is very comprehensive. I loved how the course teaches the way to read given sentences with a goal in mind (meaning analysis for SC and logic analysis for CR and RC). 

ERROR LOGS: The course also provides ready-to-use error logs, another great feature that keeps you focused and targeted. The logs make you question where you went wrong, for instance- sometimes, I’d know the concept to be used but could not translate what was asked in a timed environment; using the error logs made my job easier as I knew that I did not need to go back to the concepts but only focus on not rushing through reading the question stem. Your only responsibility while filling up these logs is to be honest with yourself, and the more honest you are with yourself, the faster you will sail as you’d know the exact area that requires fixing.

THE TEAM (MENTORS):
-	The forum: Makes the course journey personalized. Queries are answered within 24 hours. The responses are provided by qualified professionals and are extremely reliable. The forum discussion threads make you look a given problem form multiple facets and reach to the root of your concern.

-	Strategy Experts: There are so many highlights of the course, but this is perhaps the one that shines the brightest. You can mail and seek guidance from strategy experts of e-gmat. There were multiple mentors that helped me throughout the journey and gave me workable insights and I am thankful to all of them.

 Kanupriya Sharma was my main mentor throughout. I just loved how Kanupriya ma’am hand-held and guided me through my journey and always motivated me to only focus how I can improve. It is because of her efforts in providing me with the required plans that I was able to bag such an amazing score. Dhruv Joshi also helped me considerably during the last phase of my journey by providing me with the right content and areas to focus on and by providing a real of view of my progress.

THE STEPS TO SUCCESS:
Completing the course is, as the people at e-gmat would say, not sufficient in itself to ace the test. The three main pointers I mentioned above are no cake-walk and need to be nurtured with time. Thus, consistent revisions, cementing quizzes, test-readiness and mocks are all important to score well.

Congratulations on your score of 720! 

I really like the way that you have approached your preparation in a structured and clinical manner, carving out the most precise path to GMAT success. 

Your crystal-clear understanding of the structure and bankable skills truly paid off in Verbal. In SC especially, I can see the focus that you placed on understanding the meaning and structure of a sentence to get to the right answer translated to the 95%accuracy in SC hard questions.

I am glad Quant 2.0 helped build your foundation from basics and master your application to be able to solve most hard-level questions. Despite coming from a non-quant background, with your efforts and structured approach, you were able to achieve exceptional stats on the Quant scholaranium scoring the 80th percentile plus ability across sub-sections:

What is commendable is you used all the features of the course available - forums, mentorship, and error log. You not just maintained the Error Log but did a thorough analysis of your entries to identify the lingering weak areas and work on them appropriately. 

Your journey is a testament to the fact that when one puts in the right kind of effort in the right spirit, one can achieve whatever one sets their eyes on. 

Shivangisharmaa, the entire strategy team is glad to have been a part of your amazing journey.

I started my preparation by giving an official mock, in which I scored 630. I immediately knew Verbal is my weak area and I need to improve the same. After practicing few questions from OG, I had little to no improvement in my score. This is when I decided to opt for a coaching. After extensive research, I decided to go for eGMAT course. This was one of my best decisions. 
I started the course with Master Comprehension to understand the basics of a sentence. This part was really important for me as it helped me set a foundation for myself. After building my basics, I started with Sentence Correction, which was always the most difficult part for me. I gave 1.5 months to complete SC. But after the completion of the SC course, I was confident enough to answer these questions. The meaning based approach to solving the SC questions helped me a lot. 
I then started off with RC and CR. I used to score pretty well in RC, but my CR scores were fluctuating continuously. This is when Rida (eGMAT mentor) provided me several extra videos to study from. These videos really helped me boost my CR scores. 
I was pretty good with Quant, so I did not put much effort on it. I just practiced some topic quizzes and gave some mocks. 
I decided to give my first attempt in August last week, and I scored 670 (Q47 V35).
I decided to put my focus on Quant now and practiced lot of questions of varied difficulty level. I again appeared for second attempt in mid November. This time I scored 710 (Q50 V35). 
I would really like to thank eGMAT for being there with me throughout my GMAT journey and providing me the best content available for the exam.
For those who are starting their GMAT journey, I would highly recommend them to opt for eGMAT course and see the results themselves.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=39#","0","0","","","December 20, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear harshit0609,

I am glad to see the effort and diligence you have put into reaching your GMAT goals. You put in your 150% to learn and master concepts and processes that would guarantee success. The importance you placed on Master Comprehension and the basic unit of GMAT Verbal- a sentence- shows that you understood the importance of a strong foundation. This attitude carried over to other subsections, such as in SC, where, as we can see below, you gave it your all to achieve perfection in learning-

FacultyWhen I first thought of a course to focus on my GMAT preparation, I skimmed multiple reviews on GMAT Club and some other forums but couldn't figure out one standard course to solve my problems. After some more research I finally decided to try the initial 1 week trial period by EGMAT. From the get go I fell in love with the content, the videos were not long and tedious but short, concise and to the point just as I liked. After finishing up my trial week, I instantly purchased my course to get started with my GMAT prep. 
My main pain point was my Verbal section, with my approach not being decisive and most of my solutions specially for SC being based on feel good factor. The pedagogy employed by EGMAT helped me come up with a more sequential strategy to tackle SC questions, the elimination process helped me proceed from one step to the another without complicating the question. Also, while navigating through the Critical Reasoning module the structure to tackle the question and identify the argument helped me save time and look at the important keywords. 
This being just a glimpse of what the EGMAT course has offered me, to cut short and provide an honest opinion on the course I can say in a heartbeat that if you struggle with consistency in Verbal or don't have a concrete strategy for the section EGMAT is the place for you.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=39#","1","0","","","December 14, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Gozmit5,

I am happy to say that I gave the Gmat on 2nd December and scored a 740 Q 50 and V39. I would like to take this moment and tank everyone who helped me throughout this process especially Gmat Club and E-Gmat. On my diagnostic test I got a 670 and as I was new to the Gmat, I assumed that I could improve the score very easily.
However, my score appeared to had platued on the 710s. This is when I decided to take a E-gmat course. Prior to taking the course, I attended several sessions taken by Rajat and Payal on Gmat club and I had found that I was really able to relate to their process. Thus, I took the Gmat online 360 on Feb 20th of this year. 
For quant, the course is very well complied and covers every topic and reinforces your learnings by taking multiple quizzes. For me, the courses on the inequalities, sets and statistics were very helpful. Once I was done with the chapters, I had a gigantic pool of questions in the scholaranium from which I could test my learnings and the error log was very vital for me to track the questions on which I faltered. This rigorous and extensive nature of the course ensured that I was more than well prepared to tack the quant section of the Gmat. 
In my opinion, the course on verbal is the best. I was easily able to relate to and grasp the methodologies taught in the course and that is what I believe have helped me achieve such a score on the Gmat. The meaning-based approach taught me to always look for the meaning of a SC questions before going to options.  Initially, even though I believed that would waste precious time on the Gmat, I could not have been more wrong. By regular practice of this method, I was able to get more Sc questions correct and also solved them in much less time. Their philosophy of Pre- thinking on the Critical reasoning section helped me with accuracy and timing. Not only was I able to easily able to solve questions but also, I was able to do them in much less time. However, the most important learning from the course for me was in the Reading Comprehension section. Previously, in my mocks, I was unable to complete the Verbal section on time. Thus, I had a fear that I was slow, however, it was my approach that needed improvement and E-gmat helped me with that. Their processes and the practice materials gave me a good enough idea of what to expect on the Gmat and more than well prepared me for the test day.
Even though, E-gmat has a wide variety of questions, excellent mocks and several ways to cement your learnings, I believe that the processes of E-gmat were what helped me immensely.Thus, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the good people of E-gmat and I have no doubt when I say that E-gmat was the best investment I have done in my Gmat journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=39#","0","0","","","December 14, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Jagdishkumar,

																			by score report","Points","Location","So I’ve enrolled in the e-GMAT Course after doing a lot of research on which course to opt for my GMAT prep. I’ve written an official mock 3 years ago and I knew my weakest area was verbal. After reading a lot of reviews I’ve decided to give e-GMAT a try. In my first Sigma X mock I scored a 640 with 46 in quant and 31 in verbal. So I’ve enrolled in the course and started focusing on verbal. Ended up scoring a 780 in my last Sigma X mock with 51 in Quant and 45 in Verbal. And scored 780 and 770 in both my official mocks, and 720 in the main GMAT.

There are three things that I absolutely loved about the course
Super Interactive
While preparing for GMAT I realized the issue I’m facing is not the understanding of the concepts but it’s the application of the concepts in the given amount of time. And the structure of the course was such that I could learn, apply and cement the process through their modules and quizzes, especially in the verbal section. The application of the concepts was very well covered in the interactive style of their course. In following that process I could increase my accuracy from 60% to a whopping 90% in all the sub sections. 
The Dashboard and Error Log
They have an amazing and very EASY to use dashboard. It is so well defined that I could find my weakest areas in terms of accuracy, difficulty level and timing. I could focus on my weak areas and increase my score by more than 80 points without spending a lot of time in the prep. 
I can only stress and stress on the importance of the error log. I’ve revised it at least 30 times before the test. And the error log that they’ve provided is very thorough and has helped me fill all the conceptual and application gaps. 
My Coach Rashmi Vaidya (LMP - Last Mile Push Program)
She is the BEST. I was struggling to cross the 700 mark. Without her intervention I wouldn’t be able to score above 700. She would analyze my mocks, my tests, and every aspect of my profile and suggest the next steps. She has supported me through my downs and trusted in me more than how much I did. Rashmi has spotted intricate shortcomings in my profile and made me cement them really well. I really really thank her for her support and availability through the course. 

All in all e-GMAT has helped me score a 720 in spite of me having a bad test day. I’m considering a retake because I know my ability is higher than 720 and that trust was built through the course and Rashmi. 

First Sigma Mock: 640(Q46 and V31)
Last Sigma Mock: 780(Q51 and V45)
Official Mock 1: 770(Q51 and V47)
Official Mock 2: 780(Q50 and V46)
GMAT Attempt 1: 720(Q50 and V38)

Congratulations on your 80-point improvement to 720! This is your mentor, Rashmi here.  

It has been an absolute pleasure working with you. You are the perfect example of how one can ace the GMAT through a consistent, diligent, and process-oriented approach. 

It is commendable how you recognized that while you might be conceptually strong, you need to work on your application skills to be able to get to a top score on the GMAT.  

You not only built a solid foundation by going through the application files but mastered the application by working on GMAT-level questions during cementing.  

See how this process-led approach helped you get to 90%ile ability in verbal. This image shows how the time invested in learning applications in SC helped you improve to 90%ile in SC 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/90thpercentile-topic-level-accuracy  

Mastering application is not a one-time linear approach. It is an iterative process of identifying weak areas and strengthening them. You did an exemplary job of this process by constantly reviewing your quizzes to identify areas of weakness. You then set about improving these areas with a single-minded focus. I am glad that the error logs and analytics on the platform helped you in this journey.  

See how in RC, through this constant iterative process, you were able to improve not just your accuracy but also bring down the time: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/RC-stats-predict-90thpercentile-ability  

You followed the same diligent and structured approach in quant where you were able to get to the 83%ile ability level required to get to a Q50. See how the scholaranium data predicted you to get a Q50: 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Scholaranium-stats-predict-Q50  
 
Once you reached a 700 level, with your persistent and strategic approach, you improved your ability to a 750 level. I know you couldn’t get to this score on the test day, but I am sure that with your grit and determination, you will get there on your reattempt.  

I wish you all the best for the reattempt and all your future endeavours.

In fact, my case is an example where I self-studied with books for 2 months (completely from scratch) and got 700 in my first attempt, and after learning extra with e-GMAT I still got 700 in my second attempt. 

However, I would definitely stress on the difference between these 2 700 scores. In my very first attempt, I hastily rushed on the last 3-4 questions in both Verbal and Quantitative sessions, and I knew there were many random guesses throughout my Verbal one. Hence, I believe the first 700 was a complete luck.

After studying with e-GMAT, I saw their biggest strength is the structural guidance of thinking for each type of knowledge in the GMAT test. That helped me a lot on the second attempt and especially in the Verbal CR questions, where I didn't even need to rush and random guess in any question. Given the admission deadlines and current workload from my job, I am unfortunately not having enough time to re-take the test.

																			by score report","","Location","I got to know about e-GMAT from a friend of mine when I had just started to research about GMAT prep. I hadn't looked at any material till then and luckily, didn't need to after as well. e-GMAT was a perfect match for me mainly because of how structured its course structure is.  

I found the verbal section of the course the most helpful and I spent considerable time on it (about 2 months).
I started with Sentence Correction (SC) as it was a clear lacking point in the only Mock I had given prior to taking the course. (First SigmaX Mock - 540 Q40 V24). Evidently, I needed to improve drastically in both verbal and quant. The e-GMAT course helped in just that.

The depth to which the SC course was taught was incredible. The core skills such as identifying grammatical errors, understanding meaning, and answer choices analysis got firmly built due to the course. The Critical Reasoning section was equally thorough. I started solving OG questions after going through the entire verbal e-GMAT course and found all the questions pretty doable mainly becuase of the core skills and concepts learned in the course.  One can safely assume to tackle even the toughest or the trickiest verbal questions accurately if one goes through the whole verbal course meticulously.

The Quant section helped with that extra nudge required during the last few weeks of my prep. I studied specific sub-topics from the course where I thought my speed was lacking and that helped a lot in the actual exam.

Overall e-GMAT was undoubtedly instrumental in helping me achieve a decent score of 720 (Q49 V38) on my first attempt. The thing that helped me the most was not getting distracted by multiple study sources/strategies. I stuck to one study schedule without distortion and gave it all while executing it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=39#","0","0","","","December 14, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Apoorv1999,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I recently scored a 710 with Q50 and V35.

Like most aspirants, my GMAT test journey started with practicing random questions from GMAT Club and reading the Manhattan prep books. And like most aspirants I know, that strategy didn’t work. I was able to understand what was to be done in a particular problem but just didn’t know how.

I then came across the e-GMAT course.  I attended a Masterclass webinar hosted by the founder and I was sold.

Now, coming to the product. Here’s what I found great about the course 

> APPLICATION FILES: Every course offers you content, but the platform to actively apply the concepts in a guided manner is what differentiates the product. The outcome is as if you’re being taught in a live session but you have the convenience of doing things at your pace.

> STAGE WISE PREP: There’s a bifurcation of concept building and then subsequently practicing and harnessing your abilities in the concept you’ve studied. Cementing quizzes, which form a major part of improving your ability, is a very well-thought-out concept and gives direction to the prep. Otherwise, we can fall into the pattern of practicing questions side by side without categorizing or timing them. This will lengthen the time required to master the concepts.

> SCHOLARANIUM: More than the practice questions, the way your question attempt data is presented is quite helpful. This helps target minute weaknesses in specific topics or any behavioral improvements required while tackling a question.

> STRATEGIC SUPPORT: e-GMAT’s team is always reachable for any doubts in content and guidance during the preparation. Preparing for the exam can be stressful and there are times when you’re too involved in it that the obvious right path eludes you. Those are the times when the Strategy mentors are really helpful. For these reasons, my strategy mentor, Rida, was a godsend. 

The score I’ve secured is not my target score. But I believe with e-GMAT, I have the arsenal to reach where I want to be.

GMAT is an exam that requires more conceptual understanding and strategic preparation than most exams. e-GMAT’s product is curated specifically keeping that in mind.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=39#","0","0","","","December 07, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi pranavkhurana17, 

Congratulations on the massive 80-point improvement to 710! 

This is your mentor, Rida Shafeek- I am so glad to have been part of this journey with you! 

What I remember most about your journey is the time and effort you put into perfecting process and methods- you truly left no stone unturned. Just looking at your course attempts, I can see that you put in time in the application files to perfect the methodologies and processes by leveraging the guided structure of the course-

Once you spent the time to understand the process, you worked on mastering application through the right kind of practice on Scholaranium, thus ensuring that you could replicate success quiz on quiz.  

I am also glad to see that you were able to leverage Scholaranium to identify and tackle weaknesses. The power of analytics can be a game changer in the GMAT, and I am glad that you were able to harness the same and work on rooting out and eradicating weaknesses. Just a glance at your stats in RC shows how you were able to go from 73% accuracy to 91% accuracy on Science type passages, while also reducing the time you spend per question-

eGMAT's Verbal supremacy clearly stood out in reviews and it was evident throughout my course as well. 

Started off with a 670 in my first mock, and after 2 months of intense focus on verbal and quant I was able to improve this to 710-730 across mocks and eventually a 720 on the actual exam. 
 
In-depth concept videos, a massive repository of questions and easily accessible support from experts really helped ease off the preparation stress. 
Thanks especially to my strategy expert Abha Mohan who was extremely helpful during the Last Mile Program to ensure I bridge some key gaps in my preparation. Her detailed performance analysis, tailored preparation pointers and consistent mentorship in the final few weeks were some of the key factors that helped me with score improvement. She stayed invested in my progress throughout the LMP and leveraged platform analytics extensively to make sure my verbal foundation was strengthened. 

Would highly recommend the course!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=40#","0","0","","","December 06, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi sk1010,

																			by score report","","Location","After deciding to give the GMAT Exam in April 2022  , I decided to study through the OG and the material available on the internet . Though I was able to solve Quant questions but Verbal was giving me nightmares specially the under confidence in SC questions.  In June 2022 , I attended free webinars on SC, CR and RC sections organised by e-GMAT and was impressed by its approach to the verbal section. 

Finally,  with less than 30 days of my GMAT exam date , I decided to sign up for the course as I prepared to give my shot at the GMAT EXAM . But the reality shook me hard when  I gave the mock on the EGMAT platform and scored a mere 620 with Q48 and V27  . I was disheartened , and immediately seeked support of EGMAT team . They were very considerate and assigned me a mentor , who came as a  saviour to me . My mentor Abha Mohan , helped me charting a structured approach of targeting my exam . She gave me a schedule , task list to be completed wherein  every task had to be completed in sequence , no hopping over ( which was the mistake I was doing earlier in my self prep ) . 
The Egmat approach to verbal Section is top notch . The  ‘meaning based approach’  tremendously helps you in attempting the toughest of questions.
. The CR section emphasises the ‘pre-thinking’ approach. The RC section teaches you ways to effectively read a GMAT passage, focussing on the bigger picture without getting bogged down into the details . The EGMAT approach of RC helps you to understand the passage very well and saves you time from jumping back and forth to look into the passage for every question( mind you this approach helps save a lot of time) . It takes time to master it but once you do , RC becomes a lot less time consuming . 

Another important part of EGMAT course are the cementing quizzes. The structured approach of attempting the cementing quizzes gradually progresses you towards to your targeted ability. The Sigma - X mocks match the actual GMAT exam to a very good extent . 

In the end, I would like to highlight the importance of sticking to the process. Believe in the process taught in the modules and no matter what do not change your process while under pressure during the test.  

The process helped me in achieving a major 11 point jump in verbal in just 25 days and I obtained a 700 Score ( q48 v38)  in actual GMAT exam.  A major 80 point jump to my mock score. 

This would not have been possible without support and motivation of my mentor Abha Mohan . She had been a constant support through my journey , very quick in responding to my queries and resolving them . 

I would also like to thank Rajat and Payal for the awesome Platform they have created and also the entire EGMAT team who work tirelessly to provide quality GMAT Prep to students worldwide.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=40#","0","0","","","December 06, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi rajanmech09,

For Sentence Correction, the meaning-based approach is the real game changer. Even though I did not manage to get all SC correct under 90 seconds per question, I improved overall accuracy and planned to sacrifice few questions at the end of the verbal section (It is a risky strategy but somehow worked for me). My real intention was to get the first 20 questions right at any cost.

For Critical reasoning, approach for assumption, evaluation and boldface questions was very useful. My boldface question horror story ended immediately after starting CR module. (Pre-think was never my cup of tea and I relied solely on process of elimination)

For Reading comprehension, I watched two video links of recorded live classes by Harsha. He did not say anything new or fancy, but whenever I struggled in RC, I watched these two videos. 
Finally, Thanks to Kanupriya who guided me during the course. She analyzed my weak areas and assigned tasks on daily basis to attack the low hanging fruits (I do not know why like this term, but I like it).

Being a non-native speaker, it was never an easy task for me to get a decent verbal score on the GMAT exam.

																			by score report","Points","Location","In 2021, I decided to work towards pursuing an MBA to accelerate and grow in my career. This is when I started to prepare and give the GMAT entrance exam.

After taking guidance and suggestions from a lot of people, I believed that I can self-study my way through this exam. I solved the original guides and questions from many other free resources. I was fairly able to cope up in all the sections except the Verbal section. Specifically, my sentence correction was very weak.

In my first two attempts, I got a 660 (Attempt1 - Q50/V30; Attempt2 - Q51/V28). After my first attempt, I was shocked since I scored above 700 in nearly all my mocks. I thought that maybe it was just a bad day and gave another attempt within a month. I was devastated to see similar result.

After taking a break to focus on some personal commitments, I gathered courage and decided to give one last push. I realized that I had to do something different to improve my Verbal score. After a lot of research, I came across the E-GMAT course. The reviews were fantastic.

I signed up for this course strictly to improve my Verbal. After going through the course I realized that all the shortcuts I learnt from free materials were absolutely inapplicable to the difficult questions. E-GMAT's unique meaning-based approach is actually what is essential to crack the Verbal section. I learnt the importance of understanding the meaning before evaluating the options and grammar part of sentence correction questions. I realized that there are no proven shortcuts for solving difficult sentence correction questions. Yes, it initially took me 3 to 4 minutes to solve each question but slowly with ample practice through the quizzes and scholaranium's question bank helped me improve speed as well as accuracy. I first focused to improve accuracy, and then focused to improve speed. After being comfortable with my speed and accuracy through practice questions and Sigma-X mocks , I was finally confident enough to take the actual test. I felt a lot more comfortable while solving the verbal questions and landed a 10 point increment (from V28 to V38). I comparatively fell slightly in Quants section, but nevertheless landed a 710 (Q49/V38/IR8/AWA5)!

To summarize, E-GMAT helped me realize and work on the following three aspects which helped me finally cross the 700 mark:
1) Comprehending trumps Grammar - Just applying grammar rules without understanding the meaning will not help you solve the 700 level questions correctly
2) Accuracy trumps speed - If you are not able to get questions correct initially, your score will drop even if you solve the questions at a fast pace.
3) Official mocks are outdated and easier - I am sorry to break this to you. Although official mocks are the closest in terms of exam environment and scoring algorithm, it is much easier than the actual exam you will take. This is because the mocks are old, and candidates on average have improved on solving difficult questions because of which the level of actual GMAT is higher than the official mocks. E-GMAT's Sigma mocks maybe slightly lengthy, but the difficulty level is pretty much what you will face in the actual exam.

Once again, thank you E-GMAT for devising this fantastic course and helping students like me to channelize our efforts in the right direction for achieving our dream score!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=40#","0","0","","","December 01, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi cfcyash ,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT preparation in May 2022. After reviewing a few of the online courses and after consulting with my seniors who have aced GMAT before, I enrolled for the 4-month course at E-GMAT on 5 May 2022. I gave my 1st Sigma-X Mock Test and scored a 700 (Q-47, V-38).
I was quite elated with the score and thought that a little practice in verbal will help me improve my score to 720+.
I prepared a Personalised Study plan in the E-GMAT portal with the aim to complete the course within 1.5 months. I was supposed to study for 2 hrs on weekdays and 4/5 hrs on weekends
However, working in an essential service sector has its own problems. With extended work hours and extra duties, I could not dedicate more than 1 hr to preparation in the initial days and I could complete much less than I planned in the 1st one month.
I realised that only studying at night after returning from office will not help me. Hence, I decided to study for 1 hour in the morning before going to office and study for 1 hr after returning. I realised that this was a much more effective technique.
The Verbal module at E-GMAT is very structured and concept-wise exhaustive. I followed the recommended study plan for the entire verbal module. It was quite effective and I would suggest everyone to follow the recommended path and not jump around among the topics.
The path I followed was Master Comprehension, Sentence Correction, Critical Reasoning, and then Reading comprehension. What’s important is to complete and solidify the concepts of each Topic before moving to the next one. Hence after completing the concept files, application files, and practice files, complete the cementing quizzes (1 Medium and 2 Hard) before moving to the next topic.
The techniques taught for Verbal at E- GMAT such as Pause points for comprehension, Pre-thinking for Critical Reasoning, and Meaning-based approach for Sentence correction really help to ace the verbal questions irrespective of the difficulty levels.
Since I scored high in quants in my 1st mock and being from an engineering background, I thought quants will be quite easy for me. However, soon I realised that being out of touch with Maths for around 6 yrs has impacted the agility and confidence with which I used to solve math problems. I realised that there were some concepts that require some policing. The PACE system in Quants helped me in this regard. From my performance in the initial evaluation quizzes for each topic, it identified the modules that I can skip and those I have to go through. This saved a lot of time. The difficulty level of harder quant problems at E- GMAT was a bit more than the actual test. Hence it helps us prepare better for the actual tests.
I took the other Sigma-X Mock Tests and scored 670-720. However, in the official mocks I scored 740 & 750.
It took my 1st official GMAT test and scored 700 (Q 46, V 40).
I was a bit disappointed with the result, considering the high scores I got in the Official Mocks.
I approached E-GMAT for guidance and they inducted me in their Last Mile Program (LMP) program. Mrs. Abha Mohan, one of their experts, made a thorough analysis of my ESR report and prepared a customised plan for me with milestones and timelines, and guided me through my journey. She guided me to identify the areas I have scope for improvement and advised me the topics that I should revise and even provided additional study materials. She prepared customised exam plans and even gave me mental support during times I got panicky and worked up during the preparation time. The entire E-GMAT team was also kind enough to provide me free access to the entire portal for around 2 weeks during my last leg of preparation.
I gave my second GMAT test on 20 November 2022 and scored a 740 (Q51, V38).
I owe my success to the entire team of E-GMAT. Without their support, this wouldn’t have been possible.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=40#","0","0","","","December 01, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Arka1993,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I enrolled for eGMAT when I was in a need of structured content for verbal, specially, for sentence correction. eGMAT’s learning content was not just limited to the theoretical concepts but it focussed majorly on the application of concepts and this approach helped me to solve SC questions confidently. The approach to solve RC passage questions is also very effective and helps to save a lot of time in the hard passages & eliminate the wrong answer choices.

I gave my first attempt just after recovering from COVID & hence, I could sense that it was not a good attempt. Just after my first attempt, I was introduced to the last mile program. It was because of the extensive study plans and the cementing quizzes that I was able to gain confidence in verbal & improve my accuracy in hard questions as well.

After two attempts in a span of 4 months, getting a V39 in my third attempt with score of 690 (V39 Q47) gave me a sigh of relief as I was able to improve my score in verbal from V29 to V39 solely because of the mentorship received in LMP along with the eGMAT content.  Improving my quant score wasn’t a challenge but certainly a task to complete.

While preparing for my fourth attempt, my strategy expert, Akash was very supportive and he even replied to my late-night emails on holidays too! He not only guided me on time management, but also focussed on small external things which might affect my performance and he ensured that I am well accustomed to that environment by replicating the same during my mocks. On the exam day, I was extremely elated to see a score of 710 (V36, Q49) and I knew that it would not have been possible without Akash & eGMAT team’s guidance & program.

Here are my takeaways from e-GMAT’s course:

1. Massive improvement in verbal concepts and skills. e-GMAT’s meaning based approach helped me to strengthen the concepts as well as the application of these concepts in a timed environment.

2. High focus on quizzes– I was able to solve 700+ level questions in verbal because of the consistent practice of questions on eGMAT that tested each & every concept.

3.

																			by score report","","Location","I enrolled with e-GMAT the day after I saw 640 (V34 Q44) on my in my first official mock in May 2022 . I hadn't prepared for the mock but I had gone through video lessons from an Indian GMAT prep company called Career Launcher. I was far from target score of 740+ and I didn't think Career Launcher notes would be enough and so I started looking for other GMAT prep companies. I came across e-GMAT through GMAT club and I was impressed by the testimonials. I attend one of their free SC webinars and decided to schedule a free consultation call with them. After talking to the consultant, I signed up with them and gave their Sigma X-mock and scored a 580. I wasn't concerned about the overall score because I had read that the official score is usually 40-50 points higher than Sigma-X mocks. It did give me a very comprehensive snapshot of my weak and strong areas. My verbal was better than my quants. CR was a bigger concern than SC and RC was good. Algebra needed the most work among the quant topics. So I started with quants. Unfortunately, when I came to the cementing stage for the first section, I couldn't pass it no matter how much I tried. Dejected, I decided to study quants from elsewhere as it seemed like I wasn't improving. I think the problem was that their questions were extremely lengthy and I found myself running out of time. Their course is good but I wasn't a fan of their quant questions.

Eventually, I turned to them for verbal and found that that was one of the best decisions for my GMAT prep. This was exactly 2 months before my test date. I am enlisting below the things I liked the most about them (this is only relevant for their verbal content):

1. The course: Brilliant! The video format is crucial for understand nuances of sentence structure, grammar rules, and how to apply the approach they teach in real time. It is simple and very well sorted. It can look daunting but I found that it clarified my concepts so well that I could eliminate incorrect choices in questions with solid reasons easily. I don't think there is anything that their course doesn't teach.

2. Meaning-based approach and pre-thinking: I can safely say that the meaning-based approach is infallible. Not only that, when I could not remember the grammar rule for something, the meaning-based approach always came to my rescue. It worked almost every time. For CR, I had thought I wouldn't use pre-thinking because it seemed like it would take too much of my time and what if I wasn't able to pre-think the CA? I would be further confused when I looked at the options. But boy, was I wrong! Pre-thinking doesn't teach you to think of the CA for the question. Noone could possibly think of the exact CA in all situations. It teaches you to analyse and process the information in the passage such that you can come up with a FRAMEWORK for how the answer should look like or on what logic the answer should be based. That was game-changing! My ESR reveals that I answered correctly 100% of the CR questions I attempted. I had come a long way from CR being my weakest section of verbal.

3. Scholaranium: After my experience with quant questions, I was wary of scholaranium verbal questions. I was wrong. These questions were the key to my consistent success in verbal (V41 is my lowest in all of my official mocks and my real test). They are slightly more nuanced than the official questions but they teach you everything you need to know to answer all kinds of questions on the GMAT. If you have practiced enough of these questions (and analysed them well), rest assured that you will not struggle with verbal! RC questions weren't my favourite but CR and SC questions were everything and more! The explanations given for each option clarified so many of my gaps!

4. Last and most important/helpful: I had very little time left and I was struggling with completing my verbal course with e-GMAT and my quants course with the other prep company (TTP). At this point (about a month before my actual test), I reached out to their support team asking for a mentor. Rashmi, one of the mentors and strategy experts at e-GMAT, responded within 24 hours. In my last one month before the test, Rashmi has been a constant support and a guiding light for me. I reached out to her for all my little and big concerns regarding my prep. She always returned with encouraging words and a very structured plan to make improvements. She respected my decision to not do quants questions on their platform and still gave me guidance on how to go about quants OG practice. I followed her advice and was able to score 760 in the official mocks. Her guidance was instrumental in my success!

One extra thing that I absolutely loved was their application files. I watched Payal solve so many questions in those videos following the step-by-step approach that it was finally ingrained in me. Those were extremely helpful!

It might look like I am simping for about them but this is genuinely how I feel about them, especially their verbal course. If you're studying with them, you're verbal at least is sorted!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=40#","0","0","","","December 01, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey ridamagarwal,   

Hearty congratulations on the 740 score!  A 100-point overall improvement is no mean task and I applaud you for achieving this feat! It has been a wonderful experience working with you for the last month. 

You are the perfect example of how a structured diligent approach to GMAT preparation can help you get to the top score😊 

You completed each step on the way with utmost sincerity and attention to detail to such an extent that you made following the right approach second nature to you. In SC, you internalized the meaning-based approach that helped to improve to a 90th%ile ability. See how this methodical approach helped you improve to a 70%+ accuracy across all the blocks: https://success.e-gmat.com/70-percent-accuracy-in-SC 

Now, coming to CR – it was your weakest sub-section.  Despite your initial skepticism, you set about learning CR from scratch – all the concepts, and applications. Then by a focused practice on GMAT-like questions through cementing, you mastered pre-thinking to such an extent that your accuracy for CR questions in the test was 100%.  

Here is an image that shows how the time that you spent on internalizing the concepts and applications helped you get to a 90th%ile ability in CR: https://success.e-gmat.com/good-foundation-CR-results-in-90-percent-ability 

Thank you for your feedback on the quant questions. We value each feedback that we receive as this just helps us improve as a company and helps us serve the students better. That said, I believe that when one sets out to conquer an exam like the GMAT, one must be exposed to all kinds of questions to truly ace the GMAT.  

It is not easy to get a 740 – only 3 in 100 achieve this feat, fewer on their first attempt. But you have shown that when one sets an eye on the goal, even the impossible becomes possible! 

Ridam, continue to scale greater heights and inspire people with your achievements. I, on behalf of the entire e-GMAT family, wish you all the best.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started preparing for GMAT in May of this year. I gave a free GMAT mock before starting just to know what my weak points were and what needed my attention the most. I scored 580 in that mock and started preparing. I started by watching various YouTube videos , solving questions and after 2 months gave another mock, this time an e-GMAT free Sigma-X mock test, and even after studying for 3hrs (avg.) daily I could only score a 620(Q47 V27). 
Coming from an engineering background, I was always confident of my quant abilities. But even after reading several different books/watching several videos to prepare for the verbal section, I was not confident of my verbal abilities, especially my CR and RC abilities(RC being the weakest). I attended free webinars on SC, CR and RC sections organized by e-GMAT and was impressed by its approach to the verbal section. Finally, I decided to sign up for the course as I prepared.
Best part about e-GMAT in my opinion was the Personalized Study Plan (PSP) which helped me create and follow a very fruitful study plan. I straight away started with the verbal section and e-GMAT helped a lot in building my foundation for the Verbal section.
When I started preparing for RC with the e-GMAT modules, I was not very optimistic about the outcome because I have not read much books (and believe me if you are an avid reader you would do great in RC section), but based on the way I was taught to approach RC passages, types of questions , I started enjoying solving RC questions, which I used to avoid all the time, and reached at an 80% accuracy level from 55%.
After completing a particular section, it helped me solidify my concepts by giving tests known as cementing quizzes. Which really helped me know where I was lacking even after finishing a part, if I was stuck in any question I used to ask an expert and within 1-2 hours I used to get a reply.
Unfortunately due to some personal reasons, I was not able to give my GMAT within the duration of my subscription, but none the less, even after my subscription ended I got a reach-out mail from e-GMAT and they helped me by clearing my concerns, giving me tips on where I should focus more, and gave me a study plan for the remaining days till my exam.
All in all, thanks to e-GMAT, Payal Tandon Ma'am and Abha Mohan Ma'am I was able to score a 710(Q49 V37) on my first attempt.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I scored 690 (Q-50, V-32) in my first attempt in July 2022. Unhappy with my score, I reattempted in August and scored a 650. Obviously, I cancelled my score. At this point, I realized that I needed to change my preparation strategy. My consultant recommended e-GMAT to me. My focus was completely on the verbal section.
When I started the e-GMAT verbal course, I could clearly see the difference between the verbal content I had studied, and the verbal content e-GMAT taught. e-GMAT’s verbal prep was in-depth and probably covered every aspect that could be tested. The cementing process and the analytics really helped identify my weak areas and work on those. 
In October 2022, after completed the e-GMAT course, I scored 710 (Q-49, and V-36). I was still unhappy with my score, and I decided to take a reattempt. As soon as I conveyed this decision to e-GMAT, I was inducted into e-GMAT’s Last Mile Program. I was introduced to a strategy expert, Akash. Akash was like my cheerleader and mentor throughout the preparation. He analyzed my ESRs and e-GMAT analytics to tailor a strategy for me.
Through the Last Mile Program, I realized that my time management strategy was terrible. Akash gave me a time management strategy to follow. He also identified certain weaker areas and guided me through those. Finally, in November 2022, I scored 740 (Q51, V-38)
Here are my biggest takeaways from e-GMAT’s course:
1.	Significant improvement in verbal concepts and skills. This improvement was due to the focus on e-GMAT’s meaning based approach, which I believe is necessary for tackling 700+ questions
2.	Volume of practice offered – The amount of practice e-GMAT provides really helped me build my confidence. At times, I would get confused between 2 answer choices. The practice built my intuition, which significantly helped me improve. 
3.	Cementing and analysis – This helped mt identify my weaker areas and manage preparation time efficiently
4.	Last Mile Program – My strategy expert, Akash provided effective time management strategies for the test. These strategies ensured that I never struggled with the time on the test, a problem I faced in the first three attempts.
I would like to thank Akash and the entire e-GMAT team to help me through the test.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=41#","1","0","","","November 23, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear akshaj101,

When I first decided to write the GMAT, I thought solving the official guide was enough to crack the GMAT. However, I was shocked to get a 580 on my first try. I understood that I needed a competent and tactical approach to crack the exam but there are thousands of services and GMAT classes available online. I did my research and planned to go with the e-GMAT services since they have a huge success rate. 
And luckily the e-GMAT online portal was a lifesaver. I could design my own personalized study plan and set my target score accordingly. 
I also learned how to approach the verbal section in a logical way. Just like Mathematics, there are logical steps to crack the tricky verbal section. I also was heavily dependent on the Sigma-X mocks which replicate the real GMAT exam. The mocks are pretty much accurate and if you get consistent scores in the mocks, you are likely to end up with a similar score on the real GMAT.
Last but not the least, e-GMAT connects you with a mentor for mock analysis and other strategic advice. Akash Aggarwal was my mentor and helped me strategise my study plan, which was of great help.

In the end, I would suggest that It is really important to build a strategic study plan and stick to it. The GMAT is not a difficult exam but instead, a tricky exam and guidance in the right direction will definitely help you crack it.

The platform has comprehensive videos on pretty much every topic, as well as tests - both practice and diagnostic. The course was particularly helpful for quant; I went from Q33 in my first mock to a Q49 in my test. The course allowed me to build process skills that helped me solve GMAT quant questions logically, instead of simply falling back on formulas. Their section on word problems was particularly helpful- it simplified the entire process, with individual modules for work, speed, interest and sales. The Sentence Correction modules broke down the process into methodical steps and logical rules. This helped me reach 99th percentile in the SC section.

But even after reading several different books to prepare for the verbal section, I was not confident of my verbal abilities, especially my CR and RC abilities. I attended free webinars on SC, CR and RC sections organised by e-GMAT and was impressed by its approach to the verbal section. Finally, I decided to sign up for the course as I prepared to give one last shot at the test.

e-GMAT assigns you a dedicated mentor from day one who helps you throughout your GMAT journey, providing weekly study schedule as well as motivating you from time to time. The verbal section begins with Master Comprehension section which lays foundation of your verbal ability. The SC section is based upon ‘meaning based approach’ which tremendously helps you in solving 700 level questions when grammar rules fail in helping you distinguish between answer choices. The CR section emphasises the ‘pre-thinking’ approach. The RC section teaches you ways to effectively read a GMAT passage, focussing on the bigger picture without getting bogged down into the details. Since, in verbal section, it is more about eliminating four wrong answer choices than selecting the correct answer choice, ways to identify wrong answer choices are taught. Trust me, it is very crucial to learn to eliminate wrong answer choices when it comes to verbal section. As is the case with verbal section, the quant section also contains a foundational module and is divided into different modules. Each module contains lectures on different topics, covering different quant abilities tested on GMAT.

Apart from the Sigma-X Mocks, the course content that helped me the most was cementing quizzes. These quizzes help you apply the skills that you learn by watching videos on the platform and ‘cement’ the concepts in your brain, making the complete solution process a natural reflex, a kind of muscle memory. This reflex boosts your confidence and saves time while solving a question. The platform also provides analytics of your accuracy and time for different question types in the sub-sections of both verbal and quant. These pictorials help you pin-point your strengths and weaknesses. You can either analyse these analytics yourself or simply drop an email to your mentor who provides his insight into your statistics. e -GMAT also provides one-on-one sessions with SMEs to help you with your preparation. These sessions are generally meant to pin-point your faltering points and to help you bridge any conceptual gap or make behavioural changes to your approach. One such session helped me identify my weakness and improve my CR ability, increasing my mock score by 30 points and eventually boosting my verbal score on the test. In addition to one-on-one session, the e-GMAT forum can be used for any queries pertaining to the concept or the process used to arrive at the answer. My only pain point was the Word Problems module of Quant section. I believe that word problem questions were way too lengthy and complicated to be solved within 2 min and not up to GMAT standards. These questions do teach you a systematic approach to solving different questions, but the module can, at times, become a bit overwhelming.
 
In the end, I would like to highlight the importance of sticking to the process. Believe in the process taught in the modules and no matter what do not change your process while under pressure during the test. I would like to thank my mentor Dhruv Sir and the complete e-GMAT team members for their support throughout my prep journey, and congratulate them on a job well done in developing the platform.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=41#","0","0","","","November 25, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Navi2310,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I gave a test on 30th August and got a 640 with a Q49 V27. With R2 deadlines looming, I had one final attempt at GMAT. Having used GMAT Club for the bulk of my preparation, I came across eGMAT in the club and read great reviews. Hesitant at first, I attended a free webinar on one of the verbal sections and I was convinced that eGMAT could be the solution just 10 minutes into the webinar.

Since I had many other commitments in my life, I needed a way to prepare for the GMAT that was already structured and did not require my effort to organize what to study and when to study. eGMAT provided exactly that with a comprehensive study planner.

Though my study efforts were a it overestimated, I was nevertheless able to approach my preparation methodically. I had exactly 40-45 days for my preparation and eGMAT platform was able to help me make the best out of that time.

I was already comfortable with quant, so having finished the Arithmetic module (rather quickly, thanks to the PACE engine), I did not delve much deeper into Algebra or Geometry.

Verbal was my weakness and I needed solid improvement in the same. Knowing that the density of SC questions was the highest of the three question types, I started with the SC course (after the master comprehension course). The meaning based approach was extremely useful as it helped me develop a framework with which, by the time I reached the cementing stage, I was able to already pre-guess the right answers (and wrong answers!) without even looking at the options.

The fact that a certain order is emphasized (SC --> CR --> RC) is not for nothing. There is learning in SC that can be taken to CR and there is learning in SC & CR that can be taken over to RC. In essence, given my time constraints, I could not focus much on RC; however, the way eGMAT inculcates reading (and interpreting) techniques in SC and CR was helpful enough in RC.

After getting decent scores in my Sigma-X mocks, I was ore dependent on my own skills rather than on luck by the time the D-Day arrived and I was happy to end up with a 710 (Q50 V35).

I would wholeheartedly recommend the platform to new GMAT takers and repeat GMAT takers alike.

My last piece of advice to people deliberating on the which test-prep company to use - GMAT is a game (the adaptive test engine is literally one). There are rules in the game that may or may not hold good in real life. The key is to understand these rules and take them for granted while you play the game. With my little experience, I can say that the eGMAT team is one of the pro players and learning from eGMAT's platform can surely help you achieve your high score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=41#","0","0","","","November 25, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear omsgapsa, 

Congratulations on the 710!! 

I really like the way that you have approached your preparation in a structured and clinical manner, carving out the most precise path to GMAT success. A 70 point improvement in 45 days is no small feat! 

Indeed, this precision is extremely evident in your Quant course attempts, where you made full use of the algorithm to cut out a clear learning path for yourself and only target areas of clear weakness. I can see that in Word Problems, you were able to save over 12 hours of study time –

Your crystal clear understanding of structure and buildable skills truly paid off in Verbal. You understood that time was of the essence and worked out how to build your skills in the right sequence so that they could coalesce into something extraordinary. 

I also really admire how, for the parts of the course you were able to attempt, you gave it your all. In SC especially, I can see the focus that you placed on understanding and utilising the meaning and structure of a sentence to get to the right answer. In the image below, its clear that you have adopted a method that allowed you to reach the 90th percentile.

I am also really glad that the mocks allowed you to carve out such a predictable pathway to success and give you the most realistic practice possible before the exam. As we can see below, your score in the test was foreshadowed by excellent mock performance.

One of the main reasons I've choosen e-GMAT is because of the reviews that I've seen about its verbal course and from the point I started my prep i was very much lagging behind in verbal. My diagnostic test was (620 - Q48 and V28).
The coursework for verbal was pretty thorough and it really helped me build my basics from scratch. The methodology and approach towards the questions from different sections was unique and with practice i improved a lot.

The best part of the e-GMAT according to me was the scholaranium where I almost practiced 5-6 custom quizzes everyday and reviewed those quizzes after taking them. I felt they were a little difficult than the official gmat ones and thats what i liked about it as I already had a good quant knowledge it helped me solve difficult questions and make mistakes during my practice so that i can go ahead and learn from those mistakes.

One last thing that I specifically wanted to mention is that e-GMAT probably has the best User Interface and level of details that goes into analyzing your time and mistakes is amazing. It is very very underrated and not many people talk about this but unconsciously it does make your life easier.

Overall I highly rate the verbal course and scholaranium of e-GMAT and they provide good support throughout your prep with the help of some really experienced startegy experts.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=41#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on your 740! Working with you as your mentor for the last few weeks has been a great experience.  

You did not let the limited number of hours that you had for preparation come in the way of a structured systematic approach. You went about building a strong foundation by learning the concepts and applications. You then reinforced these learnings by practicing the Scholaranium questions.  

The effectiveness of this approach can be seen in how you improved from a 57% accuracy to a 93% accuracy in CR – translating to a 90%ile ability. This image shows this tremendous improvement, made all the more admirable by a gradual reduction in time to 1 min 36 sec/ question:

																			by score report","Points","Location","I gave my first GMAT test in July and i got 490, the score disappointed me a lot. It made me doubt my preparation. To be honest I was overconfident and did not prepare well initially. I had bought egmat 5 months online course in April 2022 but i did not use it in correct way at all. I just used the course to practice questions more and more without actually understanding the process behind each type of questions which impacted me a lot during my GMAT. 

After my first GMAT, I took time to clear my head regarding the doubts I had on myself. Once I cleared everything I extended my egmat course for one month and started preparing for min 2 hours everyday. Egmat verbal course was really helpful, it trained me in how to read a RC, how to think in CR and what all i look for  in SC. I felt the verbal section of course has covered every inch of the topic and with lot of dedication and preparation this course really helped me to get a good score in verbal.

I havent used e-gmat quant course at all because I have always been very strong in quant. So i cannot comment on the quality of the quant section of the course. But what i can say is that the range of questions they have in Quant is very 
extensive in terms of quality and quantity.

1 week before the exam I took 2 mocks from sigma-X mock tests. My mocks score were less. I got around 580-590 I panicked but I remember that during a egmat free SC seminar Mr. Rajat and Ms Payal has told that error analysis is very important. So I took my mocks and analysed every question that is when I realised that in all the verbal questions my thinking process was correct but either I was overthinking or I was misreading the option and choosing the wrong option. This error analysis made my realise that my basics are strong I just have to concentrate more on rejecting the wrong options. So, for the last week I concentrated on my option analysis and basics only and looked at my previous mocks and questions I answered. 

On Oct 24,2022 i retook GMAT exam and I got 680. I am very grateful to each and everyoneof e-GMAT team who designed the verbal course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=41#","0","0","","","November 08, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear chandrakanthg,

It was because of your resilience and determination that you didn’t get disheartened after your first GMAT attempt in July. You recuperated from that, refocused and faced the journey with “let’s ace it attitude”. 

What is even more commendable is that you used the error analysis to your advantage after your first GMAT attempt in July. You understood that you were not letting the process become a second nature to you which was impacting your preparation. You critically analysed the situation and with a proper casual analysis, you did not just identify your weaker areas, but also work upon them.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I chose E-GMAT primarily due to it's proven ability to improve verbal ability as I had many read many other reviews. In my previous attempt my weakest section was SC, however the master-comprehension and process skill approach employed in E-GMAT really helps eliminate any uncertainty. I felt that the first step of always understanding the overall message and identifying key elements helped across all three sections of Verbal. 

My RC strategy also changed after using E-GMAT were one thorough read of the passage was enough to answer all subsequent questions except in the case of questions with respect to specific details which at times required revisiting the passage. The focus on understanding each element of the passage plays a big role in critical reasoning. There are many traps in CR that will be missed if you rush through without understanding the overall message as a single word can make a huge difference. 

I found the E-GMAT quant course to be adequate and found some of the problems utilized to be extremely long and cumbersome. Such questions in my opinion are rarely tested in the exam and it throws off your time management abilities. However, there is a lot of depth in the concepts that are taught but if the questions could resemble more of GMAT -style questions it would be much better.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I narrowed down on e-GMAT for my GMAT prep based on their fantastic reviews on GMAT club and having spoken to a few friends of mine who recommended it. I found the course very well structured. There is a well laid out path to get to a very good ability level in each section. I would say the course material (such as concept videos and quizzes) overall is very good, although it does take quite a bit of time to get through the whole course (that being said, there are ways to actually personalise the course material at various points based on your current abilities, which I thought was quite helpful).

The course feature that I was most impressed with is the Scholaranium. This is an extremely well designed platform which provides numerous questions within each section, along with amazing data analytics which, when used in the right way, can really help you improve your performance. The quality of the questions is really good. In my personal opinion, I felt that the difficulty level of many questions in the scholaranium is at par or sometimes even above the difficulty level on the actual exam. So I would suggest do not get disheartened if you don’t see yourself scoring very well on each test/quiz. Just trust the process and put in the effort consistently. The data analytics provided within the scholaranium platform is top notch! It goes into a great level of detail, so you can actually identify which specific area you are really faltering in and then work on that area. For me personally, these features really helped improve my abilities.

Overall, I am happy that I gave e-GMAT a shot and would happily suggest it to anyone who is starting their GMAT prep journey. The Verbal modules in particular are very good. Quant is also very good, although I used both e-GMAT and Target Test Prep (which has flexible one month plans) for my quant prep, so thanks to both of them! In the end, all I would say is that don’t just assume this course is a magic wand that will given you your target score (i.e. don’t assume just by completing the course material you can attain your target). A lot of it has to do with how diligent you are in tracking your progress, doing detailed (strategic) reviews of your errors and finding out where you went wrong, maintaining a detailed error log (I cannot stress the importance of this point just enough!), mastering time management and so on. The course will help you with almost all these aspects in one way or the other, but it is up to you how you make the best use of it.

																			by score report","Points","Location","My Gmat journey started in 2021 when I decided to pursue an MBA course. Started my prep work by myself the first time and worked hard for 6 months but could recieve a score of only 660. I decided to work on my gaps and gave the test again in 2 months but unfortunately, got the exact same sub-sectional scores in both Quant and Verbal and only a 10 point improvement. 

The gap in my self preparation was a lack of structure. I used to focus on the weak areas, improve that and lose track of the components that I had already built ability in. Meanwhile, I focussed little if anything at all on Quant, focussing all my energy on Verbal. 

Thats why when I was explained the structured approach of e-GMAT on a call with one of the representatives, I decided that is what I needed- A structured, logically formulated course in which I just need to practice diligence and do as Im told. 

Thus, my 3rd attempt at the GMAT journey began in April and because of the previous effort I had put in improving my Verbal skills, the first 2 months of the course seemed quite a breeze in comparison to the Quant section. 

Quant learning was made easy by the very systematic concept files and application files in each chapter of the section. The learnings were then reinforced in the practice files and skills files. The cementing quizes would then test my ability in each section and highlight the weak points giving various indicators of the existing gaps that needed work. 

All of this effort was made super easy by my mentor Rida Shafeek who guided me through every step and gave me the confidence that I lacked in myself. I was also given special attention by Shweta - quant expert who took the efforts to teach my the importance of maintaining and analysing an error log and therefore the magic of strategic review. I felt considerably more confident in the quant section upon putting in all the effort. 

In the end, during the final month of the prep, I signed up for the Last Mile Program where I was given more attention by Rida and was taken through every step of the way in my test readiness process. The 5 diagnostic tests were a roller coaster ride for me since I did not manage to score consistently well on all the tests. But I was given assurance repeatedly by Rida that all other indicators in my preparation led to mean that I had the ability to achieve the score I wanted.

The result, I came out of the exam hall with a considerable increase in my score - 660 - 670  to finally a 700.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=42#","0","0","","","November 10, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey AG2511,

Recognizing this is difficult, as it requires you to let go of many learned behaviours, but I am glad that you were able to switch gears and turn on to the path to success.  

I can see that you have put in consistent and diligent work to improve across all subsections in Quant and Verbal.

This is Abha from e-GMAT. It was a pleasure working with you and being a part of your journey.  

Shalini, a lot of times, in life, as is in GMAT, things don’t go according to plan even when you are completely prepared for it. I must commend your resilience and consistency throughout your preparation which helped you score 720 (94th percentile).  

You followed a structured approach and immersed yourself in the process which in turn translated into your impressive Scholaranium stats for Medium and Hard level questions. Please refer to the image below where you have attained 80 percentile ability for all Verbal sub-sections in Hard questions.

I don't think I would have been able to reach the score of 730 without their support, especially in the verbal section in which I improved from a V31 in my first mock to a V40 in my last attempt. 

Although the course material, in my humble opinion, is sufficient enough for one to reach a score of 700+, the personalized support provided by the e-GMAT experts is what helps you push your score to a 720+. 

The expert assigned in my case, Rashmi, always came up with an in-depth analysis of my performance on the scholaranium platform and precisely pinpointed my weaknesses. I was also given a follow-up about what improvement steps were to be followed and how to go about them, which really helped.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hello Everyone!

Some of my learnings through my GMAT journey with eGMAT are listed below: 
- [ ] For most working professionals, You’ll have to be on your toes to get the work done. Your energy levels are very important and you must preserve them during your study hours, mock attempts and beyond. 
- [ ] Absorb the ‘Structured Approach’ and make it second nature. The sooner you’ll do so, the sooner you’ll achieve a better takt time, the time it takes for a correct attempt. Once you have your concepts in place, refining these process application steps is the only way you’ll reach the 36th question with some time in hand. The better you comprehend, the better you’ll sail through each sub section, be that be of Verbal or Quant. 
- [ ] The art of letting go: If only we were taught how to attempt exams, many would have thrived playing on their strengths and taking minimum harms elsewhere. Though GMAT score depends on your performance on each sub-section, after surpassing a cumulative difficulty level, let data of your past attempts and your intuition(general comfort level) with a question guide you on making strategical skips. After all, it’s about finishing your section attempt with Hard questions. Don’t get attached too much to a question or you’ll never even get to read the last few questions. 
- [ ] Error log importance : Quality over Quantity. Maximum learning is extracted while reviewing your mistakes. In the crucial minutes after mocks or simple tests, which leave you exhausted, do review questions in which you took too long to finalise a choice, in which you weren’t able to eliminate the choices per your reasoning skills, in which you weren’t able to comprehend the meaning, etc. Remember, if you dig deep enough, it’s always lack of a diligent and intentional shift in comprehension that results in an unsure attempt. Read the above sentence again. 
- [ ] Seeing them as Life skills : critical thinking, active prediction, finding main points, sentence level comprehension, short circuiting details. I respect this exam for the skills it has helped me engender. Your level of awareness of your surroundings will be unparalleled and you just might reach to the levels of Sherlock, Dr. Gregory House and the other high functioning sociopaths who thrive on drawing inferences by observing their surroundings. 
- [ ] Make it purpose of your life, but only for a continuous stretch of 4/5 months, otherwise it’ll hang over your head like Betal. Don’t make it a ghost hanging over your head leaving you tired in your everyday life. Preserve your energy, be fierce with protecting your time, be calm and observant during your learning hours, cement the learnings and reflect on them during your ordinary hours. In a short amount of time, you might even absorb these test skills to make them life skills. 
- [ ] Comprehension extracts the meaning which is core to solving each and every verbal question. As you read the sentence written as is and try to make sense out of those juggle of words, you’ll know what’s wrong and what’s correct. Use some rules+common sense to sail through. GMAT is a test of reasoning ability and not of English language. Do remember this fact. 
- [ ] Hats off to Payal and Rajat for putting together such a detailed course. Each question offers multiple learnings and is designed to maximise the variety of takeaways for the user. Shraddha, Kanupriya, Stacy, Arathy and most importantly Harsha have laid out such thorough and informative explanations that one is bound to excel if they follow the words closely.
- [ ] Lastly, it was through the kind and considerate mentorship of Abha that I was able to put this exam to an interim rest. From scoring a 610 on my first mock test to 740s and 750s towards the end, I was able to significantly improve my performance through her guidance. After scoring a 640 at my first official attempt and facing extreme  network instability during the second, I was a bit afraid to go over this barrier score of 640. The test readiness stage orchestrated by Abha helped me maintain my mock temperament during this official attempt to a great extent and I was able to achieve a 710. I might go for another attempt to justify the ability I have built and the time I have put into this exam. However, I wish I could have ended it sooner. Don’t let this journey turn into a vicious cycle. 

All the best fellow aspirant!

I am a quant guy, so an area of my focus was the verbal part (especially taking into account that I am a non-native speaker). As I am self-disciplined person, I was preparing solely myself.  Having done several mock tests from the official website I in most cases ended up with 700+ score. That made me feel that I am ready to take the real one.
I took my first shot in November 2021 and I found out that the real verbal part was much more difficult than I saw at the mock tests. I got 630 (Q49, V27). 
I took a rest in GMAT and started to prepare to IELTS. After successfully passing my IELTS exam, I came back to GMAT in couple of months and bought an E-GMAT course to increase my verbal score.
I really would like to thank the E-GMAT team for that course because before, in verbal part, I was mostly relying on my intuition, I was not paying much attention to the meaning, especially in Sentence Correction section, where meaning of sentence has much more weight than grammatical structure (nevertheless, it also should be correct). Scholaranium helped me to identify my weak spots and to work on them.
Finally, after couple of months I have passed my exam and got 700 (Q48, V38). Due to some logistical problems (I was only able to take the test in another country) I have decided that I am going to apply to BS with this score.
So, if you are a non-native speaker and you are struggling with the verbal part I recommend to participate in E-GMAT course.

Congratulations on your score of 700! A 11-point improvement in Verbal from 44th percentile to 84th percentile (V27 to V38) is in no ways a small feat to achieve.  

The fact that you are a non-native speaker made this journey more challenging, but it is because of your hard work and dedication that you aced the exam! I can attest that only a few non-native speakers who took the GMAT can claim to have scored 84th percentile in Verbal.  

You were always determined to improve your score in Verbal. Earlier, you were relying mostly on your intuition while marking the answers, which you afterwards realised is not the best approach. You started following a more structured approach and you went a step ahead in identifying your weaker areas and then working on them.

 I reached out to e-GMAT when I was not able to get my target score on my first attempt. Overall,  I am satisfied with my experience with e-GMAT prep even though I was not able to get the target score improvement. 
The first thing I would highlight is my e-GMAT mentor Rashmi's support throughout my prep. She was always approachable, provided me with detailed guidance on my focus areas, and drew up comprehensive test-readiness programs which prepared me for the GMAT. Her encouraging words and attitude kept me focused on the prep and GMAT. 

e-GMAT's platform is also very user-friendly. I appreciated the ability to review the questions I got wrong or struggled with, and the prompt analytics which gave me immediate feedback on my areas of improvement. 

On the course itself:
Quant:
I liked the quant course. I would rate it a little harder than the actual exam, as though I struggled with some hard questions on e-GMAT, my ability on the test was significantly better. That said, I like the in-depth approach to the topics, the PACE alternative to skip over the courses I was comfortable with, and I can say it really helped me improve my Algebra and Geometry ability. 

Verbal
The verbal course was comprehensive and made me master CR and SC. I definitely came away from the course with a better clarity on how to approach the CR , SC and RC sections as the GMAT is a lot about test taking ability rather than pure understanding sometimes. That said, I would rate the verbal course to be easier than the actual attempt. Caveat is my limited experience, but I scored 42+ consistently on the course and was unable to convert this on actual test day. 

Areas of improvement:
I feel the verbal course can be improved, especially on RC and SC. 

Overall, keep up the good work! And thanks for the help.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=42#","0","0","","","October 30, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Masters1711,

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hello Reader,
This is my review of e-GMAT. Spoiler alert, this is a positive review ( I know there are already too many positive reviews for e-GMAT, but what to say, they are efficient and effective ). I decided to prepare using e-GMAT after watching a couple of e-GMAT SC videos on YouTube. I took their first mock, which is free, and scored 710. I got excited thinking that I could score really well on the actual test if I prepared well, so I enrolled with e-GMAT for 2 months starting June 22, 2022. I skipped master comprehension and directly went to the SC section. It is really well planned and delivered, with pre and post-quizzes in most sections of every module. The meaning-based approach used by them is amazing. It really makes life easier while attempting SC questions. After completing the SC section, I attempted another mock and scored 650. I was shocked, but nevertheless, I kept on going. I completed half of the CR section and around 10% of the RC section. My scores in the rest of the 3 mocks were 730, 680, and 720. I constantly kept getting better in quant (48, 49, 50, 50, 51). However, my verbal score varied like a cosine curve ( 39, 30, 39, 32, 37 ). I couldn’t understand the reason behind it, so I ignored it. After my subscription ended, I started practising from GMAT club as I wasn’t confident in my verbal ability. I solved around 200 SC questions on GMAT club ( getting most of them wrong but never trying to address the core reason ). I thought that after giving 6 mocks ( 5 e-GMAT, 1 official: 680 ), and practising so many questions, I should be able to handle the actual test easily. I booked the test for September 3rd. A lot of things happened that day, but even if they didn't, I would’ve still scored nowhere near my target (740). I ended up getting 620 (Q49, V26). Disappointed and tired, I couldn’t think of the next step. 
The next day, I emailed e-GMAT and asked for help. Rashmi replied after analysing my ESR. She asked me to extend the course and work with her to bridge the conceptual gaps, especially in verbal. Last time I took a lot of things for granted, didn't complete either the CR or the RC section and didn’t do any cementing at all. This time I tried to follow her instruction to the point. I saw considerable improvement across every verbal section. I finally started using the meaning-based approach for SC and pre-thinking for CR questions. Eliminating the wrong options in SC became much easier, and my timing also improved significantly. I scored 720 (Q50, V37) and 740 (Q50, V38) in official mocks 3 and 4 respectively. All of this was possible because Rashmi showed confidence in me right from the beginning of my preparation for the second attempt, gave great feedback and suggestions, and helped me understand all my shortcomings and conceptual gaps. She has been a great mentor and helped me throughout my preparation for the second attempt. 
I attempted the GMAT again on October 19th and scored a 730 (Q50, V38). 
PS: I hate reading and have read no more than 2 books in my lifetime. Whatever English grammar I know is through daily conversations, Netflix, and Amazon Prime :p . So if I can get V38 then anyone can. 
There are certain things that I liked about the course and the eGMAT experience: 
(a) It is a well-structured course with quality material. 
(b) The verbal section was really helpful in improving my verbal score through the application of the meaning-based approach in SC and the pre-thinking approach in CR.
(c) For SC and CR this is one of the best courses that are available. 
(d) Questions on Scholaranium are of great help after learning concepts and applications. For verbal, the variety of questions helps cover most of the patterns observed in the actual test. For quant, the questions on scholaranium are actually tougher than the questions in official mocks or the actual exam, but that helps to get your concepts cemented.
(e) The support team answers all the queries quite quickly (within 12–18 hours), which really helps to move on, and motivates you to ask questions freely on the forum. 
(f) Mentorship support during the preparation helped me with a structured approach to preparation as opposed to the haphazard way in which I was doing it
(g) For mocks, I feel that nothing can compare to the official mocks in setting a benchmark for the expected score. Nevertheless, e-GMAT has done a great job of making the mocks as authentic as possible.
 
Things to learn from my experience :
•	Follow a structured approach.
•	A meaning-based approach to SC is the only way to GMAT SC.
•	Focus more on incorrect questions, spending sufficient time on understanding why you got that question wrong, rather than solving 300 questions. Solve 100 but know the reason behind accepting or rejecting an answer choice. 
•	Even if you’re decent at quant practice a few questions daily to keep your mind sharp.
•	GMAT is not CAT, so do not focus on giving a lot of mocks, rather give 3-4 but analyze them in a detailed manner. ( Trust me, this works ) 
•	Join e-GMAT if you want all of the above in one place. 
•	If you’re an Indian student, then do not forget to take your passport with you to the exam center.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=42#","0","0","","","October 28, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear AkshayIITR,

																			by score report","Points","Location","My background and my score before purchasing e-GMAT course-
I am non-native English speaker and I did my primary and secondary education in my mother tongue – Marathi. So, I was not much accurate with English grammar, lengthy sentences and big passages. I come from engineering background. Before starting my GMAT preparation, I took a mock to see what my starting score is. I searched on Google for a mock test. Coincidently, I gave e-GMAT sigma-X mock. My score was 520 (Q44 V19). So, there was long way to my target score of 700+. By the way, e-GMAT gives excellent analysis of all sigma-X test result.

Why I chose e-GMAT-
As verbal was my weak area, I was looking for course that shows its effectiveness on verbal. When I analyzed all courses available on Gmatclub, e-GMAT was one that captured my attention the most. After going through free trial, I found the course worth to put my efforts into.

My experience with e-GMAT-
Master comprehension module - At start of verbal section, there is master comprehension module. It taught me some techniques that helped me understand and recollect maximum information from I read. In my view, e-GMAT verbal course is great for non-native speakers.
SC module- 3 step process that SC course suggests is excellent way to solve the SC question. Sentence structure breakdown, meaning-based approach, and asking probe question were the keys to my improvement in SC. 
CR and RC module- By following e-GMAT Pre-thinking approach for CR, You understand the argument so thoroughly that choice elimination becomes a lot easier. RC became my very strong area after following the e-GMAT process of getting immersed in the passage.
Cementing process- cementing process of e-GMAT basically made me so much familiar with concept and process of solving both quant and verbal questions that I did not forget what I studied as time passed. Queries that I posted on forum were answered very logically. I was really impressed with analysis that e-GMAT SMEs provided. 
Finally, strategy experts did excellent analysis of my mock tests and gave me action plan to improve my weak areas. All plans given were impressive and because of those plans I started scoring 700 on the sigma-X mocks. These plans filled the gaps in my concepts and solving process. After this, I went through official guides, Official advanced question bank and gmatclub quizzes. On the official prep mocks as well, I started scoring 680 to 730. Finally, on test day(6th October 2022) I scored 710 (Q50 V36).


My suggestions to someone who is purchasing the course-
I think it’s the best course. So, you can start your preparation with high energy after this choice. 6 process skills that taught in quant might seem too much in the beginning, but if you follow them, they really contribute to your accuracy. I suggest following process steps very carefully. Initially they might seem time consuming, but after some practice they turn out to be time savers. I suggest taking help of SMEs and strategy experts whenever you are stuck. If you are already very good at quant, then, in my view, you don't need to go through all lessons and quizzes. 

All the best for your preparations!

Congratulations on the massive 190 point improvement!! Improvement on this scale is rare, and the fact that you were able to achieve such a vast improvement while being a non-native speaker with a history of Marathi-medium education is truly astounding. 

What I find truly wonderful is how you zeroed in almost immediately on the skills that you would need to improve from a V19- that comprehension and reading were the cornerstones you needed to establish. You put in the work to master this core skill and the fruits of this labour can be seen in how well you performed on the course modules as well.

Congratulations on a mammoth 120-point improvement and your 720 score!   

The sheer determination you have shown to get to this point is phenomenal. The 12-point improvement from a V27 (44 percentile) to a V39 (88 percentile) is highly commendable. 

For a student looking to improve their verbal score, understanding all the concepts well and internalizing the process such that it becomes second nature to you is an imperative part of the learning. 

Your stronghold on concepts and processes can be seen in your scholaranium stats, here is an image of how you have successfully translated your conceptual knowledge to 80 percentile ability in Hard questions.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT prep back in August 2021 and self-prepared with OGs and a few other books and ended up with a score of 640 (V-29, Q-47). While doing the prep, i came across several success story videos of E-gmat and was quite intrigued with the process discussed such as meaning based approach for SC and Pre-thinking for CR. I did go through a couple of webinars of E-gmat for SC and CR and tried to imbibe the process into my prep, but clearly, I had too little time on hand to do justice with it. After the 1st attempt, I was sure that I was going to buy the E-gmat course because the process made logical sense to me, and I needed a structured approach. I took a break from my prep and purchased the E-gmat course in February 2022. The plan was to prepare for 4 months and give the test in June 2022. But due to work commitments, I could not really prepare regularly till mid-May. Coming to the course, to start with, it asks you about your current scores and your target scores and accordingly suggests a plan forward. The most important course to start with is their Master Comprehension course. It literally helps you to master the comprehension. It teaches you the basic structure of a sentence, the pause points, how to break a sentence and how to assimilate the meaning. Post this, I started with my verbal course doing SC, CR, RC in that sequence. Each course comprised of concept files, concept quizzes, practice quizzes and the most important, the application files. The application files teach you, in a guided manner, how to solve a question in a structured way. Post completing all these files for each section, the course suggests you to cement the concepts by taking few cementing quizzes. The cementing quizzes are handpicked questions by the E-gmat experts of medium and hard difficulty. I did the cementing for all the sections (i.e., scoring 70% or above in medium difficulty, and 55% or above in hard). Though it was not easy at first, but post reviewing each of the question I attempted and taking the corrective actions such as going back to the specific concept/application files where I feel there is a gap, I was able to build up an ability to solve questions. Post this, I went on and did OG questions for practice. In between, I attempted my first 2 sigma X mocks (E-gmat mocks) and scored 650 (V35, Q44) and 690 (V40, Q44). I realised that I have built a base ability in verbal and just need to refine some areas to maintain the ability. Post scoring a 690, I was included in the Last Mile Program, a program where a mentor helps you out to get test ready. 
My mentor, Abha Mohan, connected with me and helped me out with a plan to refine my rough patches. By looking at my account statistics she figured out that I was struggling with concepts such as modifiers and subject verbs in SC, Evaluate and Strengthen in CR. Hence, I went back to the course, revised few concepts, and reattempted the practice files. Post this, there was a confidence within me in my ability to solve questions within a limited time. Next, she shared a plan with me for my test readiness where I had to give few combined quizzes of 25 questions and 33 questions. I scored a decent 76% on both the quizzes for verbal and around 60%-70% in quants. I gave my last official mock before the test and scored 710 with a V37 and Q49. Finally, went ahead with exam and ended up scoring a 700 (V35, Q49). The test day was not a great experience because of lack of sleep and some bad decisions during the test. As I was struggling with time in Verbal section during the end, I made the most terrible mistake to not finish my Verbal section and ended up getting a 3-point penalty, which was evident in my ESR where my average Verbal score was a 38. It was my bad decision which may have cost me about 10-20 points in my overall score. 
To conclude, few important things that the course emphasis on are: 1. Just because you have completed the course, that doesn’t mean you will not have to go back again and again to the specific concepts. Revising the concepts is going to refine what you have already built. 2. One should strategically review each question that he/she has solved and in that review each of the options are to be reviewed. One should have absolute clarity as to what was correct in the correct choice, and what was incorrect in the other four. Unless you do this process with diligence on all the questions that you solve, the improvement will not be visible. 3. Maintaining an error log is as important, if not more, as solving questions. If you do not maintain it, it will be difficult to understand and accept where exactly you lack or what mistakes do you make. 4. The solutions to each of the questions, be it verbal or quants, are detailed and follow the structure which has been taught in the concepts. If there are still any doubts left post reviewing the solution, there are forums below each question where there are several questions asked by previous students and these have been responded to by the E-gmat experts. These forums helped me significantly in getting clarity over every aspect of the question. The final thing to note is that just buying the course alone will not guarantee success. One must imbibe the process and be diligent to really make use of this excellent course. Have patience and trust the process.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=43#","1","0","","","October 13, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi guptaya3,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started prepping towards GMAT in end Dec 2021. I had been working for the past 10 years and had lost touch with studies, and highly competitive exams like GMAT were an uphill task. 
I did my research and enrolled in the eGMAT course. In my initial mock, I got a 640 with a V36. The score boosted my confidence and made me approach the course with my own strategy as opposed to eGMAT's recommended approach. I covered all the topics esp the quant but skipped the verbal and learnt it on my own. I later realized that this was a big mistake.
I studied in this fashion from Jan 22 to Mar 22 and started taking official mocks from Apr 22. My official mock scores improved from 680 to 740 (verbal score in the range of V40 - V42) in this period close to a month. In between I booked my official GMAT for 17 May. However, torrential rains played spoilsport as I reached the exam center late on test day, drenched from head to toe and very anxious.
I went through the exam wet and cold and ended up scoring a 670 (Q49, V32). I was totally disappointed by the score and straight away cancelled it. I assumed that anxiety was the reason for my poor performance and decided to redo the exam soon enough. The very next day I gave the last remaining mock in the eGMAT and scored a 710 with V40. I felt confident about my verbal level and concentrated on quant. Then again after rigorous preparation, on 22 June, I gave my exam again and got a 690 (Q50, V33). I was shocked by my verbal performance, but decided to keep the score.
I realized that I had a serious problem with verbal and I needed to address it. I sent an email to eGMAT seeking help and that’s when Rashmi, a strategy expert and mentor from eGMAT, reached out to me offering help. She prepared a one-month plan to improve my verbal score and reinforce my quant score. I diligently followed the plan and I was evaluated on every step. She also helped me out with the strategy and pointed out the mistakes I did in my prep. 
Verbal is all about having a solid strategy, practicing it and putting it to work for the test. But my verbal strategy was loose and it sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t. That was what was affecting my performance on test day. I improved my verbal strategy through eGMAT’s curated course. I revised the quant topics and finally on test day on Jul 27, I returned with a score of 730 (Q49, V40).
These are certain things that I liked about the course and the eGMAT experience: -
(a)	It is well-structured course with quality material
(b)	The verbal section was really helpful in improving my verbal score through the application of meaning-based approach in SC and pre-thinking approach in CR.  
(c)	SC is one of the best courses that is available 
(d)	Questions on scholaranium are a great help after learning concepts and applications and helps master the section 
(e)	Timely support by the support and strategy team helped me take the right steps and make informed decisions at the right time
(f)	Mentorship support during the preparation helped me with a structured approach to preparation as opposed to the haphazard way in which I was doing it
However, I also felt that for quant, the material and questions in eGMAT may be used for studying and not exactly for exam experience or exam practice. It is almost impossible to finish any of the questions in 2 min. Gmatclub tests were very helpful for my quant prep.
Overall I would suggest that if you are opting for the eGMAT course, take help of the strategy expert sooner rather than later as it would help you achieve your desired score asap.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=43#","2","0","","","October 20, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Amd9dnd,

“Your Quant Improvement” 

You improved your Quant score from Q44 to Q50. I can see how you excelled on Quant modules, especially those in Geometry and Algebra (Your GMAT skill file scores are excellent). I appreciate your feedback on quant questions as we are on the constant journey of improving ourselves. Having said that, I believe that preparing for GMAT is like “preparing for war” and you should be ready to take on the most difficult questions. 

Overall, they say it is human to falter but what takes great courage and determination is to learn from it and turn it around to success, and congratulations to you for having achieved that.  

I, on the behalf of the entire e-GMAT family, would like to wish you all the very best in your MBA journey and all your future endeavours.

																			by score report","","Location","While I had heard about e-GMAT from various internet channels, I didn’t believe in its value until recently. My friend told me that she has done full prep course with e-GMAT over couple of months and she scored 760 at her first attempt. By that time, I had already passed GMAT exam after 4 month’s self-study (700 – V38, Q48, IR7, AWA6) and I was planning to prepare application for Columbia Business School Early Decision. The deadline was just 3 weeks away. I checked out e-GMAT’s free trial upon my friend’s advice and felt so much regret that I didn’t study for GMAT with this platform. I immediately understood that e-GMAT offers structured approach for verbal SC and CR, which were my weakest sides as it’s usual for nonnative speakers. While I had just 3 weeks and had to do the application as well, I reached out to Payal, she took my story very personally and immediately returned to me with thoughtful plan and wise advice. Since CBS is accepting EA as well, it was more rational for me to do EA in parallel with application submission process. Needless to mention how much support I received from the whole e-GMAT team on this journey. I registered for e-GMAT’s GMAT Online Focused course on 5th September and received detailed study plan from Rida how to use the course for EA prep. I first tried EA on 11th of September in 6 days after registration to check my starting level EA score without doing the suggested course from Rida, as was mostly focused on essay writing. I scored 156 (V10, IR11, Q15), which is equivalent of approximately 700 in GMAT. Since I already had 700 score in GMAT and I did not want to send application with this score to CBS, I started to study with e-GMAT for EA and in 11 days after the first try, I scored 160 on EA (V13, IR13, Q14). During the one-week study period, I concentrated on verbal and IR. I found IR section especially helpful, as well as cementing quizzes in SC were exactly what I needed. I want to highlight once again, how much motivation and emotional support I have received from Rida and Payal during this journey. That’s another major thing that makes e-GMAT platform incomparable along with its structured approach for studying. I strongly and enthusiastically recommend e-GMAT to anyone who is preparing for GMAT. It’s the best value for money in the least possible time (price is very affordable). I just applied to CBS and waiting for the Early Decision results. In case I’ll need to study for GMAT again, I’m sure e-GMAT will help me in GMAT score improvement- similarly like it helped for EA.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=43#","0","0","","","","","",""

After attempting one free official test (in which I scored 570), I realized that I needed to really improve my verbal score. The verbal course material was really comprehensive and made me develop a very logical approach to solving verbal questions. I believe, that one of the most important element that e-gmat taught me in verbal was the section. which helps you to understand, how to read strategically in the verbal section of GMAT. This really helped me to improve my score from 550 to 710 in my first attempt.
From my sigma mock-X scores, Payal reached out to me to tell me that she saw good potential in me and told me that if I needed, she could help me with a personal tutor without any additional cost – Rida, who would help me plan my study in the limited time I had. This really helped me to push the boundaries further and I was scoring in the 750's in official mocks. With the e-gmat team's help, i was further able to push my GMAT score to 730.

																			by score report","Points","Location","GMAT is altogether a different beast. Hard work is not the only ingredient which is important here. I had scored a 710 in my first go, but the golden threshold of 720 was what I had my eyes on. But going beyond 700/710 is altogether a different ball game. That is when I realized what eGMAT can do for me. Looking for a course after that 710, I didn't take me much time to decide upon eGMAT. The sheer number of 700+ scores they have achieved over other courses should give you a hint. 

Starting from RC, Harsha (at eGMAT) is the guy here! Everyone has a tendency to be uncomfortable in the essays which are from fields/subjects unrelated to your profession. But Harsha got you covered here. From learning the importance of pause points to pre-thinking, I was able to get rid of my fear of those healthcare and historical essays.

For CR, this is the toughest part in GMAT. So you want the best here (Harsha is your guy again). eGMAT gave me an all together different weapon in my arsenal for tackling CR: Pre thinking. Trust me this works wonders. From starting with zero bold face questions right to getting all of them right has been an incredible experience. 

For SC, practice plays a big role. But 700 level questions are still tough, until you discover the meaning analysis, Payal is going to teach you. For all those 700+ SC questions, meaning analysis is the key.

Lastly, a shoutout to my LMP mentor Rashmi, she was there for me always. Giving me prompt replies to all my queries, making schedules for me, letting me know my weak points, pushing me till the end. She made it happen!

Thanks eGMAT.

Congratulations on your 730! I am super happy that we could help you cross that ‘golden threshold’ of 720😊.

To do this in a matter of less than a month is the icing on the cake.  

It is easy to give up after getting a 710 but it takes a person with determination and resilience to persevere and put in the efforts to get to their target score.  

The efforts that you have put in is clearly visible in CR – where you have almost perfect first-time scores in practice quizzes for Boldface and a 70% accuracy for last 20 hard questions.

Despite being at a higher ability in SC, you set your eyes on the stars and did the entire course and internalised the meaning-based approach that helped you clear hard cementing quizzes in SC with great accuracy putting you at a 90%ile ability in SC.  

The diligence that you showed in the preparation resulted in amazing scholaranium scores that predicted a 90th %ile score in verbal.  

Refer to this snippet of Ajitesh’s account to see how the verbal scholaranium predicted 90%ile score in verbal:

																			by score report","Points","Location","Having experimented with the free trials of various prep providers, I decided to go for e-GMAT considering its simple interface and highly structured prep plan. 

I simply followed the order in which the entire course was laid out by e-GMAT - the order of concepts and the order in which every concept was structured (pre-concept quizzes, concept learning files, post concept quizzes, cementing quizzes and ability quizzes). This helped me methodically deep dive into concepts, cement my understanding and build test taking EQ at the same time. 

I found both verbal and quants basics course to be very effective as building block tools, specially for students who aren't strong in either. Specific e-GMAT strategies such as pre-thinking in verbal and process skills in quant are game changers. Constant AI-assisted analytics insights throughout the course were very helpful in managing time efficiently - I focused more on my weak areas and kept nourishing the strong ones. 

The question bank is amazing. It is at least 2 levels tougher across all difficulty levels than the actual GMAT, making the actual test sort of a cake walk. Scholaranium is, again, a game changer. Sigma X mocks simulate actual test environment very closely, and post test analytics are superb - they helped me analyze how my speed and accuracy varied as the difficulty kept going up or down. This helped me develop the right EQ for the actual test by consciously tracking the time to determine which questions to attempt or let go. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend e-GMAT for GMAT preparations. If used consistently, 2-3 hours a day for 5 months can easily land you 700+.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=43#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT Journey began in last year, when I took the e-gmat subscription in June 2021. Before attempting the actual GMAT, I gave two official mocks and scored 730 and 710. I was confident to get a score of atleast 700, but to my utter surprise, it turned out to be a 670 (Q50, V30) when I first attempted the GMAT in Aug 2021. I revised all the error logs, scholaranium quizzes and re-attempted the GMAT in Oct 2021, but again failed to get anywhere close to my target score of 730-740. I was completed clueless as to where I am faltering. 

My confidence about my abilities took a serious hit and I decided to take a break before re-attempting the GMAT. Moreover, as all B-Schools had their deadlines in early January for Round 2, I decided to take a break till March before starting my GMAT preparation again. 

I decided to re-enroll into e-GMAT in Last week of March 2022, only to focus on cementing my test taking abilities. I first revised all my notes which I had made in the previous attempts. Two months into the course, I felt a need for guidance regarding the assessment of my performance so far. That’s when I first wrote to e-GMAT support team and was replied back by Abha, one of the mentors and strategy expert at e-GMAT. Her detailed analysis about my abilities on the scholaranium platform helped me to build up my preparation brick by brick. Abha constantly provided me the stats and details about my weaker areas and created customized quizzes for me, something which helped me strengthen my weaker areas. She constantly showed me the true picture of my abilities and helped me imbibe confidence.
Based upon multiple quizzes suggested by Abha, I came to realise that it was only meaning based approach where I was lacking and I started to work towards it. Specially, in longer sentences, I identified only the subject and the verb pairs and omitted the details in between – an approach that helped me immensely to boost my SC capabilities. In CR, I fumbled upon assumptions questions and adopted a strategy to just focus on the conclusion and see if it breaks down after negating the five answer choices. 

After attempting multiple custom quizzes as suggested by Abha, and two official sigma mocks wherein I scored 730 and 740, I finally took an online GMAT date of 12th Sept 2022. However, I was completely shattered to see a 670 on the screen. Totally clueless and feeling absolutely dumb, I approached Abha for her guidance. Though I was doubting my abilities heavily, Abha asked me to book a test date within next 10 days and suggested that all the parameters on the e-GMAT platform suggests that I have a 730-740 ability. I blindly trusted her and booked my test date for 23rd Sept 2022. 

In the last 10 days, I figured out the reason why I fumbled in my attempts. It was not because of ability but because of exam readiness that I was faltering. Moreover, the online GMAT didn’t really suit me as the feel of a proctor constantly monitoring you kept ticking me at the back of my mind. In the last 10 days, Abha helped me to get into a mindset of exam readiness and not focus on the end result. She prepared sort of a motivational video wherein she mentioned that she has absolutely no doubt that I had a 740 ability. She asked me to take a sigma mock 2 days before my GMAT and I scored a 740 in the same. I built up the mindset in the last 2 days and went to the test center with only one thing in mind – not at all focus on the score. Just focus on the question and apply a meaning-based approach that I had practiced. Finally, words cant describe the happiness when I finally saw a 720 on the screen. Though it was 10 short of my target score, nonetheless I was more than happy and happily accepted the score. I wholeheartedly thank my GMAT mentor Abha for all the guidance and support - be it strategical, motivational, and emotional.

Positive: They cover SC to the depths. Once I remembered all the rules, exceptions, figuring out any SC error was easy. pre-thinking was good technique. 

Negative: I felt bad with their responses as well. Found them little arrogant in dealing with my problems. Sometimes things can't be explained on e-mails, they should learn this.

I signed up for the e-gmat course after hearing good reviews from co-workers. After attempting one of the free official practice papers and the sigma X mock, I realized that I needed to seek help with the Verbal section. The personalized study program at e-gmat validated the same. The verbal course material was really comprehensive and made me confident that I had exhaustively covered all topics. 
Soon, I was reached out by Payal suggesting me to work with an e-gmat mentor – Rashmi, who would help me plan my study in the limited time I had. The analytics provided by the Scholarium platform coupled with Rashmi’s feedback facilitated me to cement my weak areas. 

I was struggling with SC questions, where my approach was primarily rule based. E-gmat’s meaning based approach allowed me to not only reduce my attempt time but also improve accuracy. Finally, strategically planned mocks helped me become more confident about my skills, something really important for the final exam.
I am thankful to e-gmat, especially Rashmi, for helping me prepare better for GMAT.

Following is a brief timeline for your reference:
1st Free Sigma X Mock – 29th May 2022 – Score 710 (Q48, V38)
Plan Purchased – 5th June 2022
Mock 2 – 30th June 2022 – Score 700 (Q49, V36)
Mock 3 (After LMP – Last Mile Push program) – 11th Sep 2022 – Score 750 (Q50,V41)

																			by score report","","Location","I scored a 720, which was a 240-point improvement from my first cold mock.

Here's the stuff eGMAT is doing very well:

1. Concepts are covered right from scratch, assuming the student doesn't know anything about anything. That's a good thing because I used to make a lot of conceptual mistakes in the quant section and an overview helped me iron those out.

2. The website is flawless. Everything is easy to find and access, subsections are divided in a logical manner, and I don't remember the portal malfunctioning even once in 6 months.

3. There are a lot of people involved in the doubt-clearing process. Every question on the portal has a solution, and there are thousands of questions. Doubts are cleared within 12-24 hours and are on-point most of the time.

4. The cementing process is much more important than it sounds if you're stuck in a subsection and can't seem to get better even after a lot of practice.

5. Verbal preparation is tremendous, especially when you actually follow what they say. The 'meaning-based approach' that eGMAT follows is by far the best way to handle CR questions with 90%+ accuracy.

6. The feedback process is fast and helpful. An analytics engine tracks every single question you've attempted on the portal and assesses your accuracy for you. When you want to find out where you went wrong, not only can you search for subsection errors (SC, CR, ALG), but also subtopic errors (modifier, assumption).

7. The Last Mile Push Program is a godsend for the last few weeks before the final day. If you get selected for it (or buy the thing), you get an expert who accurately analyses where you can improve and creates an action plan for you to follow. Every day.

8. There's a one-month extension option too, which is great for all of us who are bad at managing time :)

There's also some room for improvement.

1. Scholaranium questions could be more accurate, difficulty-wise. I've found that OG questions are a lot easier, especially on a high difficulty level, than the ones on Scholaranium, although this could be by design. I found that I was consistently scoring higher on OG questions than on Scholaranium for both sections.

Overall, I think eGMAT is definitely worth a shot.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=44#","0","0","","","September 29, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Devansh,  

This is Abha from e-GMAT. Congratulations on improving from 480 to 720. Not many people improve their GMAT score by 240-points. One contributing factor driving that improvement is your persistent focus on excelling everything that you tried.  

You knew the challenge that lay ahead of you because you created your personalized study plan based on your first Sigma-X mock. In fact, your actual GMAT score was just 10 points shy of the score predicted by the final Sigma-X mock. 

Please refer to the screenshot: 
https://success.e-gmat.com/Devansh-StudyPlan-from-480-to-720 

In Verbal, I loved the fact that you aced Cementing and hit all the metrics. Your hard accuracy stats predicted your 90th percentile score on Verbal. In fact, you got so good that your accuracy on medium-difficulty questions was almost perfect. 

Please refer to the screenshot: 
https://success.e-gmat.com/verbal-success-predicted-by-scholaranium 

We also appreciate your feedback regarding the Scholaranium questions. 

Having said that you must understand that “Preparing for GMAT” is like “Preparing for War” and you must be prepared to tackle the most difficult questions out there. Bottom line – our job is to minimize surprises for you.  

Did you know that because of the PACE enabled design of Quant Scholaranium, e-GMATers have accounted for 65% of all Q49+ scores reported on GMAT Club. 

It was a memorable experience engaging with you in the LM program.  

I wish you all the best for the next steps!

With the help of official Guide, GMAT club and Veritas mock test, I was able to score 710 on my first attempt. It gave me the confidence that I could score higher with a little extra effort. But after 2 more attempts in 2020 (720 and 710 again), I found myself unable to break the 720 barrier. My 2 biggest problems were: 1) Lack of speed in verbal 2) Consistency in Quant.That's when I decided I needed professional help and I enrolled with e-gmat. E-gmat monitors their student performances with such depth that within the first few weeks,Payal (Co-founder) reached out to assign a mentor (Rashmi) to me. Even though quant was not my weak area, Rashmi advised me to go over the entire Quant course once. While I had my apprehensions, thankfully I trusted the process. As expected, I consistently started scoring 51/51 in all my subsequent mocks/ practice tests.However, the real game changers for me were the test readiness practice tests and customised practice test. It helped me get over the timing issue in verbal. My verbal score shot up and I was much more confident this time.A comprehensive analysis of every practice test helped me identify and iron out a lot of my weaknesses very easily. With a 730, I only wish I had taken up e-gmat sooner.

Also, the Scholarium dashboard provides deep insights into the areas that can be improved, the ""low hanging fruits"". Scholarium helped me gauge my weighted accuracy (Easy,Medium,Hard) at 70%.

																			by score report","","Location","I am very happy with my result and I am thankful to e-GMAT for helping me achieve this result without spending too much time. 
When I decided to study for GMAT, I considered different options such as self-study using books and GMAT Club resources, taking different online courses and hiring a private tutor (this option was too expensive for me). There was overwhelmingly large quantity of resources available, and I had limited time for the preparation, as I work full-time. I heard about e-GMAT from a friend of my friend and decided to check it out. I used free trial and decided to purchase the course because of two reasons: 1) the course has structure which I knew would save me time by helping me focus on relevant areas and 2) I liked how the concepts were explained for each section and that each concept was followed by tests. 
I started studying for GMAT in January 2022 and had to stop after two weeks because I was busy at work. I continued my preparation from May and studied for about 10 – 12 hours a week using e-GMAT for four months. e-GMAT helped me a lot with both quant and verbal.
For quant, I needed to remember math concepts that I learned at school and I needed to learn relevant terminology, as I had studied math in my native language at school. Watching e-GMAT’s concept videos was very helpful for me to refresh my knowledge and learn some techniques that school has failed to teach me. After concept videos, e-GMAT offers questions to solve, starting with easy and going to very hard. Video or written solutions are offered for each question. This structure helped me master the skills to solve complicated GMAT questions in time. One of the best skills I developed was solving data sufficiency questions without doing full calculations. e-GMAT also offers cementing process, which is very important for developing confidence in one’s abilities and cementing the skills. 
As for verbal, I was good at reading comprehension from the start (I read non-fiction literature in English), however I struggled with critical reasoning and sentence correction initially (I got v31 on GMAT Club’s verbal mock before doing e-GMAT’s sentence correction module). I did those sections on e-GMAT and got v45 on exam as a result (I would have gotten higher mark if I had managed time better). e-GMAT teaches both concepts and the process to apply knowledge in such manner that after I completed the course I was able to easily solve most difficult questions. 
I highly recommend e-GMAT course, it is very helpful even if you are starting GMAT preparation from scratch and it is quite inexpensive. I recommend that if you take the course, you follow their instructions and not skip concept videos or cementing part.

Congratulations on a great score and thank you for your kind words. A 14-point improvement in verbal and a 760 in the first attempt is no mean feat! In fact, very few people improve their GMAT score by 170-points, and fewer still score a 760. I commend you on your diligence and dedication. 

You set out the right way by planning for your GMAT preparation journey by creating your Personalised Study Plan which showed that you would need around 3 months to reach your target score and you were able to do that in the planned 4 months. 

Here is the screenshot of your Personalised Study Plan (PSP): 
https://success.e-gmat.com/590-to-760-study-plan 

“GMAT Quant” 

Your diligence is clearly visible in GMAT Quant where you excelled in all GMAT Skill Practice files. The screenshot of the Primes Module and your scores in 3.11 GMAT Skills practice files indicate the same. 

Refer to the screenshot here: 
https://success.e-gmat.com/great-first-time-GMAT-skill-file-scores

In fact, because you did so well on the course, you excelled in Scholaranium right away. You had to solve fewer than 100 questions in each subsection.  

Refer to this image to see how Scholaranium predicted your quant score: 
https://success.e-gmat.com/85percentile-in-quant-predicted-by-scholaranium 

The same diligence you showed in verbal too where in you had great first-time practice quiz scores in SC and CR that helped you build great ability – your Scholaranium stats predicted that that you were at a 90%ile + ability in SC.  

And to have achieved all this, working full – time in the first attempt itself goes to prove that when one sets out to achieve something wholeheartedly, nothing is impossible! 

Mariam, on the behalf of the entire e-GMAT family I wish you all the very best for your applications and your future endeavours.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started with my GMAT Journey in May of 2022. I started my preparation by purchasing the eGMAT subscription and for my entire prep I had only and only one source: eGMAT. I completed my GMAT journey in August and few data points of my GMAT prep journey are as follows:
1. Score Improvement
(a) First mock (590) used to create PSP to 700 (Q49, V36)
2. Verbal Prep 
a) Completed MC, SC, CR, and RC to bridge certain gaps.( SC summarised notes prepared)
b). Solved 852 verbal questions during cementing and test readiness phases
c) Followed the cementing process and only moved to the next stage on meeting the requisite threshold (Medium level questions- 70% and Hard level questions- 55%)

3. Quant Prep
a) Utilized PACE engine to make Quant preparation efficient, learning only what I was required to learn.( Module wise summarised notes prepared)
b). Solved 900 questions in Quant in Cementing and Test Readiness phases

I started off my verbal prep with  Sentence Correction and was not able to meet the threshold level in the cementing quizzes and therefore had to do the entire SC module again. After SC, I completed the CR and RC  module and was able to complete the cementing stage with requisite thresholds. Finally I went on to Quant and in  the  eGMAT Quant every sub topic has a diagnostic test at the very beginning to guide students with different level of abilities- if I was strong in Geometry, the AI driven software would guide me in a way that I only had to study limited content. This helped me save time in my preparation and focus only on my weak areas and keep working towards improvement. After completing every QUANT sub module, I would undergo the process of cementing to ensure that I hit my target abilities in each subsection. Taking these quizzes would enable me to deal with GMAT like questions and strengthen my process abilities. Every eGMAT question provides the students with forum posts related to the doubts and issues faced by the other students. This would allow me to resolve my doubts and also strengthen my conceptual understanding. I could also post fresh doubts that would get resolved within 24 hours by the egmat team. The mentors for Verbal- including Harsha, Kanupriya, Stacey and  Shraddha would provide excellent support on the forum. On the quant side also we had Bikramjit, Aditi and Shweta who would provide detailed solutions to each problem. These interactions with the subject matter experts were very helpful for me to increase my understanding of dynamics of GMAT test like problems.


Coming to the test readiness stage- I was assigned a mentor to guide me through my preparation – Abha Mohan The test readiness phase is one of the most important stages of preparation and having Abha’s guidance at every step of the way helped me structure my improvement plan and work on my weak areas after doing a detailed analysis of my Scholaranium account my mentor told me to revisit few modules in SC and Number properties and Word problems. Post my test readiness quizzes I was told to take mocks with a gap of 3 to 4 days between two successive mocks and Abha would help me put together an improvement plan after every mock so that I could work before my next mock. I scored a 660 on my first mock and was completely unhappy with my performance but Abha guided me and helped me with a improvement plan and also did a thorough video analysis of my mock. I scored a 700 and 710 in my next two mocks. However, I scored a 670 on my first official test. I became extremely sad because of the drop in my score but Abha guided me and helped me work on a small improvement plan and in the last 2 days of my preparation guided me with the final day test plan. Her support really helped me regain my confidence and I was able to ensure that I remain calm enough to make it to the exam day. To regain my confidence, Abha suggested that I take a few custom quizzes and I was able to regain some level of calm and composure upon seeing my scores in these custom quizzes. Finally, I scored a 700 in my second attempt with a Q49 and V36 split.

Followed the Cementing Process and met the threshold. 

Belief in yourself and the course – Even when your mock score took a hit, you continued to believe that you could make it into the 700 Club and you were ready to work on the improvement plan with the right spirit. 

 The Result ? YOU SCORED 700 and 710 in TWO consecutive Sigma-X Mocks.

The three most important things that helped me succeed are the course content (approach), answers by experts in ‘ask an expert forum’, and assistance by the support team whenever requested for help. In particular, I would also like to thank Harsha, Stacey, and Kanupriya for their support throughout the process

Here, I would like to share a few important lessons I learnt from the course:

Master Comprehension: The Master Comprehension course is MUST do section before starting with SC, CR or RC. This section helped me to develop the skill of comprehending the sentence accurately, skill that is of utmost importance in acing all the three sections 

Sentence correction: The MOST important approach I learnt from eGMAT course in this section is to understand the intended meaning rather than focusing on grammar rules. I strongly believe to master this section one must learn the skill of comprehending the sentence and identifying the aspects conveyed in the sentence before checking the grammar rules. This meaning based approach will help eliminate at-least 2-3 options immediately before struggling to identify the grammar errors in each sentence.
NOTE: The lessons learnt in SC will help in CR and RC. Hence, do not start with CR or RC before achieving decent performance in SC

Critical Reasoning: A few important lessons I learnt from eGMAT course in this section are
1.	Understanding a) what is the evidence b) what is the conclusion c) MOST IMPORTANT - How did author come to the conclusion based on the evidence provided = Logic used in arriving at the conclusion using the evidence = Understanding the argument is THE most important step in CR
2.	Do not be fixated only on what is the conclusion in the CR. You must remember that the CR argument is testing on our ability to understand the logic on how evidence is used to arrive at the conclusion. Pre-thinking technique helped me to significantly improve this skill
3.	Understanding why an answer choice is correct and why it is incorrect is also very important in improving in CR. Focus must be on learning concept from each question but not on solving more questions
The course provides all necessary methods in improving and mastering these skills

Reading Comprehension: A few important lessons I learnt from eGMAT course in this section are
1.	Always read the passage in identifying the ‘WHY’ aspect and not ‘WHAT’ aspect. Identifying the intent and purpose of each sentence helps in comprehending the passage better
2.	Do not answer the questions by matching words, but must understand the logic of the sentence/para/passage. In understanding the passage, do remember to pay focus on key words such as because, due to, caused by, while, since plays a very important role
3.	Keep in mind that Inference = What author believes and agrees with but not the ones that is just mentioned by some third person
There are much more nuances taught in the course that eventually helped me to improve my RC abilities and accuracy

eGMAT blogs: The blogs in eGMAT website are brilliantly written and are highly helpful in learning new concepts. I would highly recommend everyone to go through these blogs. 

Course features: 
The cementing quizzes, custom quizzes, and ability quizzes helped in identifying and improving on my weak areas efficiently. Overall, I strongly believe the course is very well designed to any GMAT aspirant irrespective of his/her current capabilities to achieve high scores. Course is designed in such a way that it makes one to learn the concepts and processes in a happy rather a stressful way.

Exam day: I never felt nervous on the exam day as I had complete faith on the approach I learnt from the course and was confident that I could handle any new question faced in the exam

Important suggestion: ONLY trust the meaning based approach and do not fall prey to ads that persuade you to follow any other approach","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=45#","1","0","","","October 30, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey Krishnak13,

Your review clearly shows the depths you took to understand and internalize the process. Your emphasis on intent and the ‘why’ aspect shows me that you have hit the nail on the head when it comes to succeeding in GMAT Verbal.  

Indeed, when I look at your journey through the course – from the modules, to cementing, to mocks, it is clear just how much time and effort you put into each subsection. Just a glance at your course and  Scholaranium stats indicates that you were constantly working towards 700+, by revisiting files and tweaking your process to improve ability. 

In verbs, you identified that there was still room for growth – so you went back to the files and revised them thoroughly to fill in the gaps in your knowledge and also perfect your process for questions from this concept.  Just look at how much time you spent- 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Diligence-On-Verbs-Files  

I can see that this revision and refocus really did help you achieve perfection. You were able to improve from 61% to 80% accuracy – which indicates ability above the 90th percentile!

Your love for learning also shines through in the fact that you went beyond the course material –. You looked at blogs and engaged with subject matter experts and strategy mentors, so that you could build upon an already solid foundation and make it impenetrable. 

Your detail-oriented approach and dedication to process are going to take you a long way in B-School; I wish you all the best Krishnak13!

But when I started my preparation, I soon realized my preparation was going directionless and I was not able to track my progress properly. Sharing this problem with one of my friends, I was recommended to take the e-GMAT course.
I checked out the course and I started by giving the first Sigma-x-Mock. I secured a 650 score. Being a non-native speaker and not good at literature subject, I knew I will have a steep learning curve. I was confident that starting it would not be a great challenge. But later when I started the course slowly, I realized my gaps.
The e-GMAT course is very comprehensive and covers a very good depth when it comes to both sections. The approaches suggested are very convenient to apply, but we have to be patient enough to make the approaches intuitive to ourselves and keep trusting the process.
As suggested by e-GMAT, I divided my preparation into 3 stages- Concept, Cementing (working on application), and Mocks. During my first phase of preparation, I was not regular and didn’t revise well, this led to spending more time making my concept clear.
Meanwhile, I was hitting roadblocks during my preparation and was sometimes demotivated. I reached out to the strategy team at e-GMAT. I was assigned with Rashmi for help. She helped me to identify the problems and gave me action items to solve my problems. Sometimes the action items seemed to be too much, but it was very helpful to progress during my preparation. Rashmi also made sure that I give regular updates about my preparation which helped me be accountable to someone during my preparation.
After going through the course at e-GMAT and giving my first attempt, I feel I have more scope for improvement in my scores and now I know where exactly I need to work. Hence, with some support from e-GMAT, I am planning to give it one more shot at GMAT. 😊

Tips for the people who are starting their preparation
I want to keep the crisp.
1.	You must be very discipline with your preparation. It is not much to ask for if you want to be in top 3 percentile throughout the world.
2.	The basics should be on your fingertips.
3.	Revise and reflect.
4.	Have patience and trust the process.
Please take some time to let the above pointers to sink in 😊
Hope this helps, especially the one who are starting their GMAT preparation journey.
Thank You.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=45#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","There are a multitude of online test-prep options for GMAT, but what separates e-GMAT from the rest is not just the pedagogy, course content and the Scholaranium platform, but also the committed set of strategy mentors, who are always there to guide, mentor and motivate you.

Having read so many reviews and after watching so many success stories, I was sure there must be something that e-GMAT has and others don't. Initially, I was thrilled by the amount of granularity that the Scholaranium platform had to offer and I immediately signed up for the course. After signing-up, the first activity I did was to take a diagnostic mock to ascertain my level. I scored a 610 (Q48, V26) and it was a no brainer that Verbal needed a lot of work. 
So, I got started with the Master Comprehension course - a module that is extremely important for all the subsections. This module consists of nuances such as strategic pause points, which come in handy when one is reading long sentences. Thereafter, I did the Sentence Correction module and I could see the change in my approach to the SC questions. The meaning-based approach is a game-changer. Of course, the grammar rules taught in the course are as important as the methodical approach to each SC question, but the meaning-based approach will take you from a 70 percentile to a 90+ percentile. And I can say that because it helped me score a 98 percentile on my actual attempt. 

Just like the meaning-based approach in SC, the pre-thinking approach is a game-changer in CR, and I didn't notice it until I actually started using it. Of course, it requires a conscious effort initially, but once you get used to it, it starts happening sub-consciously and saves you a lot of time. Add to this approach, the specific step-by-step methodology required to tackle each question type, and this is true even for the RC module. With that being said, the essence of the course is in strengthening your basics and making you become process-oriented. If one can stick to the process and believe in the e-GMAT processes for all types of questions across sub-sections in the Verbal section, success on the GMAT is inevitable. And I was successful, when I took a mock after completing the Verbal score, scoring a V35 - a 9-point improvement in less than 2 months. Gradually I got better and even scored a V41 on one of my mocks later.

Coming to the Quant section, I must say that this is an underrated course. First of all, the PACE enabled course lets you go through only those concepts that you’re required to go through, thereby helping you save time. Then, the sheer clarity with which the concepts are presented, followed by the concept quizzes and practice quizzes strengthen your basics so well that one can easily tackle the sub-600 and 600-700 level questions on the GMAT. And for the 700-level questions, you have the Scholaranium platform. The types of questions on the Scholaranium platform help you get better at taking care of the traps that one usually gets into on the trickier questions on the actual GMAT. Add to that the granular level analysis provided by the Scholaranium data, which helps you identify your improvement areas. I truly believe that if you leverage the Quant course well, a Q50+ is definitely attainable. And I'm saying it because I hardly practiced 40% of the questions, due to time constraints.

Now coming to the most important factor that differentiates e-GMAT from many others and in fact, any other test-prep company is the support it offers to the students through its dedicated mentors. As a part of the mentorship, which is offered along with the course, one always gets a personalized approach and expert guidance throughout the preparation. I got a chance to work with three different mentors throughout my journey, and their contribution to my success is as much as the contribution of the course. When I started working with Harsha, as a part of the Last mile push program, I was faltering in the CR and RC sub-sections. To understand the exact issues with my approach, Harsha was generous enough to get on a 1:1 session with me, first for the CR sub-section and subsequently, for the RC section. And after these sessions, I was able to course correct the behavioral issues, performing well across subsections subsequently. Harsha is undoubtedly the best Verbal subject matter expert I’ve ever come across. Combine that with his ever motivating nature. There were times during my preparation when I felt dejected, but Harsha always made sure I was looking at things positively. His contribution to my score is significant. As is the contribution made by Kunal and Rida. After my previous failed attempt, in which I managed a 660, Kunal shared with me the improvement plans for all the subsections and he kept track of my performance, not just in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of time management. He constantly kept sharing feedback and corrective measure plans for the areas I was faltering in and made sure I was always on the right path. Towards the end, but the most important leg of my preparation, Rida helped me analyze and take lessons from my mock scores and even when I performed terribly on my last mock before the actual test, she motivated me by keeping me in the positive frame of mind and by sharing the last-minute-tips that proved to be extremely helpful.

The contributions by the mentors become especially important when I look back at my journey and realize how their suggestions to make some small tweaks to my behavior and approach made a significant impact on my final score. I still remember Harsha telling me to “enjoy reading the CR arguments / passages” while solving CR questions and that made a lot of difference to my subsequent accuracy in the subsection. Similarly, Kunal told me to not just focus on the accuracy but also the timing aspect. He made me work on the timing aspect and that helped me finish both my sections on the actual test in time. Likewise, Rida’s suggestion to breathe after every question helped me immensely on the test day, especially considering the fact that I’m an anxious test-taker.

To sum it up, I’ve no second thoughts in claiming that if you stick to the e-GMAT process and do everything diligently, there cannot be a better option for your GMAT prep. Thank you, e-GMAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=45#","1","0","","","November 15, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear ShakebAjaz,   

Congratulations on the massive 100-point improvement to 710. This is Rida, your mentor from e-GMAT.   

 Not only is a 700+ score not easy to get but a 12-point verbal improvement from V26 to V38 makes your success all the more commendable. Kudos to that!  

 You have shown how through sheer grit, perseverance and a process-oriented approach one can achieve what only the top 10% of the test takers dream to achieve.   

 Here are a few key takeaways from this inspirational journey:  

 You set about planning your journey the right way by taking the diagnostic mock to assess your starting abilities and creating a personalized study plan to guide you with your preparation.   

You followed the plan diligently, first learning the fundamentals and then solidifying your ability by mastering the application by working on the questions on Scholaranium.   

It is commendable how this systematic style helped you internalize the meaning-based approach and reach high ability in SC. Here is an image that shows how consistent and methodical efforts helped you get to a 90th% + ability in SC:

 While you used this process-oriented approach in verbal, you streamlined your quant preparation focusing on your weak areas through an atomic study pathway designed by the PACE engine. It has to be mentioned here that you saved close to 40 hours in your quant preparation through this strategic approach.   

This image below shows how in Word Problems alone you were able to save over 10 hours through the use of PACE:

																			by score report","Points","Location","The high popularity of the e-GMAT made me choose their course and I have to say it lived up to my expectations. With years of experience, they have developed these courses that are highly functional and extremely streamlined.

Their verbal course is hands down one of the best. GMAT is an exam that tests your logical ability and I believe a strong fundamental approach to logic is needed to tackle GMAT with ease. e-GMAT's teaching methodology relies on the most fundamental things - Meaning based approach for SC and Pre-thinking for CR. With these fundamental approaches in mind, one will be able to handle the toughest questions on GMAT. Not only do they teach these techniques, but they also provide a framework to work on them until they become second nature to you.

The Quant course is more than adequate. This PACE-enabled course helps you navigate the voluminous Quant curriculum quickly by understanding your strengths and abilities in each sub-topic. e-GMAT's questions in Quant are usually tougher than what we see in GMAT/OG but it never hurts to be over-prepared. If you feel Quant is your weaker area, this course helps you a ton.

Scholarium (e-GMAT's test bank portal) understands you better than you understand yourself. With one quick glance, you can understand what your strengths and weaknesses are and focus accordingly. Trusting Scholarium blindly will make your life easier during your GMAT preparation.

The sigma-X mocks are very close in nature to the actual test. They give you a very good understanding of where you stand and what else is needed. 

The Last Mile program (e-GMAT's mentorship program) is icing on the cake. This program helps you during your mocks. Each mock is immediately analyzed and they come up with a customized plan just for you until the next mock. 

Rida, my mentor, was very helpful and friendly during this journey. She is experienced and understands the ins and outs of GMAT preparation. She was there whenever I needed her. Having an experienced test taker like Rida as your mentor is a huge plus to your GMAT preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=45#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on reaching the top 3%ile! A GMAT 740 is an amazing score and I am so glad that I could be part of your journey.  

Your path to 740 is an embodiment of the phrase “trust the process”. Your score improvement from 590 to 740 goes to show that with diligence, determination and perseverance, nothing is impossible. Your mock scores are testament to the fact that with the right attitude, you can move mountains -  

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/Mocks-Predict-GMAT-Success 

I absolutely love how you were able to focus on the underlying skills required to ace the GMAT – logic and meaning. By focusing on these two aspects, you were able to master GMAT Verbal and reach V40.  

I can also clearly see how you combined a structured learning pedagogy with feedback and data from Scholaranium to tackle weak areas with laser-sharp precision.  

For example, in RC you saw a potential for improvement in Economics and Business type passages.  

As we can see below, by focusing on improvement in this area, you were able to improve your accuracy from 58% to 84%, and also reduce your time from 2 mins to 1min 24s – phenomenal! 

Image Link - https://success.e-gmat.com/RC-Focused-Effort-And-Imporovement  

Your improvement from Q44( 50th percentile) to Q50 (87th percentile) was a cakewalk, because you made the course work for you by highlighting weak areas and creating a streamlined learning path. You tackled even the toughest questions, so that on D-Day, you were able to attempt every question with ease. 

Your willingness to learn new methods, and most importantly, to unlearn old habits sets the foundation for your success.  

I wish you all the very best for your MBA endeavors Robu – I cannot wait to see where the future takes you, but I am sure you will plan that journey as successfully as this one.

Realised I needed some sort of expert guidance and subscribed to the e-GMAT course after seeing the GMATclub reviews. Fast forward to 6 months and I have a 740 (V39, Q50).

Key takeaways:
Verbal: The specific frameworks taught in each and every aspect of the verbal section are crucial to ace the section. Coming from an engineering background I never had the confidence to tackle the SC questions. The e-GMAT meaning based approach really instilled confidence in me and improved my SC solving abilities significantly. CR was another tricky part and the pre-thinking approach was a gamechanger. Helped me save quite a lot of time during the actual exam. Same with RC. The techniques taught were brilliant.

Quant: Quant has always been my strong part. Still needed some guidance in specific question types like PnC and Probability. The e-GMAT course had a wonderful curriculum and boosted my confidence in those specific topics as well.

The most useful section of the course was the Scholaranium. It is an extremely resourceful tool comprised of question tailored to your needs. The analytics section highlights your strong and weak areas and it really helps to streamline the final preparation. The mocks replicated the actual level of the exam and my final GMAT score was pretty similar to the scores I was scoring in the e-GMAT mocks.

Also signed up for the Last Mile program where Rida monitored my daily progress and provided her inputs. Really helped me in the final lap of the journey.

Kudos to the whole team of e-GMAT for all their efforts!

																			by score report","Points","Location","Thank you E-GMAT, I could improve my score from 670(Q47, V35) to 710(Q50, V36) with one month of diligent preparation. The amazing Analytics of the E-GMAT course facilitated my journey.

For my previous attempt, I thought that self-study using OGs would suffice. However, I could not cross the 700 hurdle. With a very hectic full-time job, I understood that I needed to tackle my next GMAT attempt in a very focused and efficient manner. I saw the E-GMAT reviews on GmatClub and subscribed to E-GMAT online course for my journey ahead.

My next phase of preparation with E-GMAT started in June 2022. The e-GMAT course is very comprehensive. It's Quant and Verbal sections cover all that is required to successfully ace the GMAT exam. Along with the course, I also received free subscription to GMATCLUB tests. 
E-GMAT online course + GMATCLUB tests = The Winning Formula.

From my previous attempt, I understood that Number Properties, Algebra, and Geometry were my weak areas. Since I was time constrained, I decided to strategically work only on those areas. I took cementing and timed quizzes. I practiced from their Scholaranium and improved my ability to score Q50 on the actual test.

E-GMAT Verbal section is very comprehensive. SC Module was extremely resourceful. The meaning-based approach helped me tackle SC questions in the right way. SC Practice and Application questions coupled with cementing and sectional quizzes helped me improve my accuracy in SC from 70 to 90 percentile. I think the E-GMAT SC course is enough to improve one’s accuracy to 90+ percentile.

My E-GMAT SIGma-X mock scores were very similar to my actual GMAT score. I scored 720 in two of their mocks just days before the actual exam. 

Due to paucity of time, I could not utilize E-GMAT CR and RC courses. However, I will utilize them for my next attempt to break the GMAT 750 barrier.

I want to thank E-GMAT once again for helping me in my GMAT journey.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my preparation for GMAT in June 2021 when I had taken some other classes and gave my first attempt of GMAT, scoring a 650 (Q45 and V34). I knew that I had certain conceptual gaps and felt the lack of application skills required to solve questions in the most efficient manner in a timed environment. I took a break from GMAT and started preparing again in May 2022. This time around I tried the free lectures on the e-GMAT website and instantly loved how structured and comprehensive the course was. 
Verbal Course: With e-GMAT’s Master Comprehension course and meaning based approach, I really understood the pause points, reading strategies, importance of contextual words, structure of sentences and most importantly visualisation of sentences which helped me to tackle the daunting long sentences, not only in Sentence Correction but also in Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension. Critical reasoning being my weak point needed a lot of work. Earlier in my preparation I felt that I was falling for the trap answer choices. However, with a consistent application of the pre-thinking approach, I started identifying a pattern in most questions which improved my accuracy and ability to solve Medium-Hard level questions for Critical Reasoning.
Quants Course: Similarly in Quants, while I was fairly comfortable with the concepts, understanding and application of e-GMAT’s “Process skills” such as Infer, Translate, Simplify, Manipulate, Visualise, All cases, Apply constraints was a real game changer for me. Each module in the Quants course is comprehensive and gives an opportunity not only to learn the concepts and skills but also to apply them to similar questions immediately which boosts your confidence to tackle similar kind of 650-720 level questions. Further, e-GMAT’s PACE function, diagnostic quizzes and analytics tools shortened my preparation time significantly for topics I was confident about and ensured that I had a targeted focus on other topics. 
Cementing and Error logs: Cementing of the modules, strategic review of each question and logging of the mistakes with corrective actions/ learnings in the error logs made me identify the areas which needed work and helped me bridge the gaps in my conceptual understanding and application skills. The error log entries along with made revision of the entire course really quick and ensured that I made a conscious effort not to repeat the same mistakes again. Further, the discussions available on the expert forum and the quick responses from the e-GMAT team helped in timely addressing my doubts, line of reasoning, understanding the trap answer choices, etc.
Mocks and strategy experts: The SigmaX mocks on e-GMAT are excellent in their questions and gives a detailed review of your performance. For instance, the time spent on each question and each block, whether it was adequate, in excess or too low and also how you progresses throughout the mock. I worked with Rida Shafeek, one of the mentors and strategy expert at e-GMAT. She analysed each of my mock in depth and gave me hyper-intensive feedback on the weak areas, ideal time to be spent in both the Verbal and Quant sections including the subsections and various blocks of the exam. Between each mock, she gave me test readiness packs to solve. I could see an improvement in my time management in each subsequent mock and scored a 690 in the first mock and a 750 on the last. 
I scored a 730 on the test (Q50 and V39).
Overall, I had an amazing experience with e-GMAT and truly grateful for their efforts and their support  in my preparation. I would recommend e-GMAT for their well-structured course and Scholaranium which has ample of good Hard level questions to solidify your concepts.

Congratulations on the 96th percentile score! 

I really enjoyed working with you in the weeks leading up to your GMAT attempt. What struck me was how you truly immersed yourself in the process – unlearning old habits is one thing that most students struggle with in their preparation. But reading your review, it is clear to me that you have put in the time and dedicated effort in order to let go of processes that haven’t worked in the past and embrace pathways that lead to success. 

This is clearly visible in Verbal – your effusive praise of the Master Comprehension course makes it obvious that you understand that the core of Verbal success is meaning, you carried this learning into all Verbal subsections. I can see in CR, the effort you have put in to get to a 90th percentile ability by internalizing the pre-thinking approach.  

Have a glance at the image below to see Aastha’s amazing CR ability.

In Quant as well, you understood that it was the process, not brute force, that would lead to success. The process skills (I am glad to see that you can list them all out!) helped you tackle GMAT Quant with skill and strategy, and the PACE engine on the e-GMAT Platform ensured that you took the swiftest route to a Q50. 

All of this effort to learn and improve would have been meaningless without learning from your mistakes – which is where the error log comes in.  Just a glance at your mocks shows how you were able to improve consistently -

Your improvement in cementing, test readiness and mocks are a testament to your understanding of one key fact – to excel in the GMAT, the goal is not to make zero mistakes, but to make new mistakes every time.  

I wish you all the very best for your next endeavor Aastha – any program would be more enriched to have you as part of its cohort.

The course was so well-structured and comprehensive that it helped me finish my prep in a little over two months and helped me score a 720 on the first attempt.
I started at a low score (around the 60th percentile) in the quant section. The quant course was so helpful, especially the PACE engine, that quickly helped me identify my weak areas and recommend steps to study, thereby saving a lot of time. I never thought that I would finish my quant prep within a month. The quality of the questions was impeccable; they were a close representation of the actual questions in the exam.
The best part of e-GMAT's verbal section is its SC course. I was introduced to the meaning-based approach, which transformed my SC score. I usually used the elimination technique to differentiate and eliminate a few options, but I quickly realised that it only works on medium-level questions. You must know the meaning-based approach and specific grammar rules to ace hard-level questions. And the course was beneficial in this. The RC reading strategies also helped me significantly reduce my time in reading the passages.
The structured three-stage learning provided by the course and the fantastic guidance by the mentors were a great help as I just had to follow the personalised plan for me. This helped me save a lot of time and put my entire focus on studying rather than planning.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT preparation with e-GMAT on March 2021. Prior to that, I bought the OG and practiced the questions directly, and  subsequently gave an official mock test where I scored only 660. I felt that I lacked structural preparation, especially in Verbal section. I researched a few courses, and found that e-GMAT was more structured and more pocket friendly than other courses .


I started with quant section, which was pretty good. I went through the course in quick time, and cementing quizzes helped me brush up my concepts. The way to solve the DS questions was especially noteworthy, as I never had previously solved those questions with such ease.

Coming to verbal, the introductory module about the sentence comprehension was really helpful.  The SC module was also excellent. A new meaning based approach was introduced, and the specific way to solve GMAT SC questions by dividing sentences into chunks was really helpful.
I thought that as I solved RC  before in my school days, it would be a little easy to me.

However in CR, I was completely faltering in pre-thinking, and drawing inferences from each sentence of argument. Somehow, I went through the section with a half baked knowledge, and really could not understand the explanation given at that time. I somehow completed that section in haste and then went for test readiness at which point I contacted the e-GMAT customer care. They assigned Kanupriya Maam as my mentor. She designed a strategy plan, in which I failed to cross the benchmarks in CR and RC(specially in humanities and Finance passages). I was frustrated and solved a lot of questions from RC and CR, exhausting the Scholaranium Question Bank, but I could not cross the benchmark.
 
I reverted back to Kanupriya Maam, and she helped me to pre-think properly, and draw inferences, through a zoom video session. She also helped with RC passages which I was not solving properly by sending a prerecorded video where she showed how to draw inferences and summarize the passages in proper way. After that, she again devised a new plan, and I went through it, but this time I was failed badly in SC and RC. This time, I knew that I was going wrong in not maintaining the error log, the most important thing in learning process. Also the analytics showed that fixation on wrong questions took a lot of time. I felt that SC is my strong suit , and that I need to strengthen it more. So I started going back to previous incorrect questions in SC and took a manual error log (not recommended, instead should do with each cementing quiz as discussed in CQ video). I found the modules in which I made the most mistakes, and started working on them.

I started giving mocks there after with this strategy and the scores increased by 20 points each time, which increased my confidence. I saw that the remaining time counter really had a positive effect on me (due to not fixating on CR questions, and drawing the inferences correctly,). The Subsequently, I booked my GMAT date and went for the exam and achieved my target score.

Overall, the e-GMAT is a very wonderfully structured program, and the Scholaranium Analytics and the personalized mentors (Kanupriya Maam in my case) are some the best features it offers to which I am grateful. I surely recommend this for online GMAT preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=46#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

 I fell in love with the platform immediately. The platform is super easy to navigate and use. e-GMAT's Scholaranium question bank is one of the best.  The platform saves a lot of your time. Maintaining and revising error logs became very convenient.

The platform helped me identify my weak areas and the time I took in each section by providing analysis of all my quizzes.
This analysis was important to me as it gave me new insights and helped me identify where I had to focus more.

e-GMAT's meaning based approach for solving SC questions is the best
 
I used to take 1minute 45 seconds to 2 minutes to solve an SC question and my accuracy was also not high, but after going through e-GMAT's meaning based approach the average time I took to solve an SC question came down to 1 minute 15 seconds to 1 and half minute and my accuracy also improved a lot across both medium and hard level difficulty questions.

Apart from the course the thing that most impressed me is the support and encouragement they gave.

I requested for a personalized study plan and I was assigned Ms. Rashmi as my mentor. 

She gave my preparation a direction and helped me get out of my comfort zone. 

She was really concerned about my preparation and kept pushing me to be consistent with my preparation. 

Her pep talk and last minute tips before the exam helped me calm my nerves and helped me do well on the exam. 

I want to genuinely thank e-GMAT and Ms. Rashmi for being a part of my GMAT journey.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Having scored a 640 (Q48, V28) in my first attempt at GMAT after preparing on my own, I knew that I needed to take some preparation course that would set me on the right track and help me achieve my target GMAT score and that’s when E-GMAT came into the picture.

When I was preparing for my first attempt, I thought that the official guides were enough to help me reach the 700 mark. So, I just solved the questions from the OGs and would sometimes randomly look up certain topics on YouTube where some of the top videos that would come up were from E-GMAT. From there, I understood that E-GMAT is a trusted source. Anyway, I wanted to take my first attempt without any external help, and I scored a 640 then.

After that, I explored a bit more about E-GMAT and it seemed like everything I had wanted for GMAT. So I signed up for the course. The things that I liked the most about the course were the personalized approach and the expert guidance that I got throughout my preparation. Every step of the way I was getting constant feedback and corrective measure plans for the areas I was faltering in. Abha Mohan (one of the E-GMAT experts) who was mentoring me made sure that I was not leaving any stone unturned and constantly motivated me to push further. 

I also want to break down my learning experience in various sections/subsections:
Sentence Correction: I think I can safely say that this course changed the way I read sentences. The meaning-based approach that E-GMAT teaches compels me to understand the logic behind every sentence.
Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension: These courses taught me to read between the lines and get as much information as can be extracted from a set of sentences.
Quant Section: Starting from the very basics of mathematics to teaching how to tackle difficult and tricky questions, the quant section is divided into various subsections and teaches in a way that does not involve any memorization or shortcuts. 

Scholaranium (the E-GMAT question bank) is an extremely resourceful tool that offers carefully selected questions (resembling those that are asked on the real test) that can be accessed through various types of quizzes. The cementing quizzes that are ought to be done after completing each subsection helped me retain my learnings while moving on to the next subsection. 

So after preparing for two and a half months, I started with the mocks. And even though I did not perform well on the first 2 mocks and felt demotivated, Abha was there as always to my rescue; she helped me gain my confidence and provided a corrective plan, setting me on the 700+ track. 

Then I booked my test date 10 days in advance and just practiced with the already solved questions in the last few days. Through the entire preparation period, I solved 850+ questions from both Verbal and Quant with more than 60% overall accuracy in hard questions. On the test day, I was confident and calm, and as I clicked on the next button to see the final scores I kind of already knew that my hard work had paid off. I scored a 710 with a Q49 and a V38.

All in all I can say that E-GMAT was the best choice I made in my GMAT journey. I had a wonderful experience. I really want to thank Abha Mohan (my mentor) and the whole E-GMAT team for tremendously helping me achieve my target score. I highly recommend E-GMAT to anyone who is looking for a preparation course for GMAT.

Additionally, I would advise that once you take up the course and if you have sufficient time, then don’t rush through the learning part. That’s the most crucial segment and if you do that right you won’t face many problems with the questions later. I wasted a lot of time coming back to certain files again and again. And also make full use of the discussion forum. I wish all the best to anybody who is reading this post.

Verbal-
The frameworks in CR and RC are instrumental. The sentence correction course structure was fantastic. The way the concept quizzes were created ensured that you would get similar questions of increasing difficulty levels, making it easier to identify areas of improvement. The strategies adopted by egmat are effective and well explained. 

Quant-
I went through only a few topics I had faced difficulty with earlier. The EGMAT course helped me clear my doubts and cover all concepts. Also, the PACE feature enables you to trim your course prep to only those topics you have issues with, determined by the diagnostic quiz at the beginning of the module. I used to not tune into quant modules because I used to feel slowed down. Still, the PACE feature helped me focus only on the relevant portions, thereby ensuring I could cover topics faster without the fear of missing concepts.

Mocks- The Mock's UI was similar to the actual GMAT exam, which helped me immensely on the test day. The questions are also well balanced. While I did not score very high on mock tests, those were more because of the gaps in preparations and time management than the EGMAT mocks being unrepresentative of GMAT. 

In my opinion, the EGMAT course's outstanding feature is its Scholarinium analytics. The Scholarinium product is data-driven, and I felt that they kept throwing up questions in which my understanding was suspect earlier. The questions are on the tougher side, especially the Hard questions, which help you formulate your concept application strategy. I would recommend everyone to use the dashboard analytically, and when used in tandem with your error log, it can help you dig deeper into your preparation. 

All the best on your GMAT preps !!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=46#","0","0","","","","","",""

For quant, EGMAT does a great job of dealing with bite-sized basics and the concurrent practice quizzes help you test yourself on individual concepts in an incredibly precise manner. I followed the course from top to bottom.

For SC, I went through the EGMAT course (~30 hours) - covers everything - verbs, pronouns, modifiers, comparisons, parallelism, and idioms. EGMAT keeps things simple and easy to comprehend, avoiding any unnecessary grammar jargon (which GMAT does not expect you to know either).

I found EGMAT mocks' difficulty level to be quite close to the actual exam.

Third Attempt in March 2022 : 680 :( 
Fourth Attempt in July 2022 : 730 :) 

So EGMAT technically helped me improve my score by 50 points, I was struggling with SC a lot but EGMAT helped me work on my SC skills, the meaning based approach is perfect. In none of the question I looked at options until I know what the sentence was trying to say and this approach became wired me in mind, I was hitting 90-100% accuracy on SC questions. 

CR again I was facing a lot of issues and the questions I used to solve were always repeated since by my third attempt I have solved almost all the official question. EGMAT with its scholarium product brought 100s of new questions and helped me build my brain muscle to understand the CR passage and follow a right path while eliminating the wrong choices.

I found the verbal course very attractive and apt for solving sentence correction question in systematic approach. In my opinion, understanding the meaning of the sentence was the key to solve all sentence correction questions.

Initially, it was time consuming, but after solving practice quizzes in Scholaranium, I was confident to solve difficult questions. Technics such as prethinking in critical reasoning, getting immersed in reading comprehension helped me a lot to achieve decent score in verbal section.
Quants sections was good in terms of application and practice quiz. I learned how to solve difficult questions without consuming too much time.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I recently used the e-gmat platform to prepare myself for the GMAT test. It was an absolutely positive experience and I am tremendously grateful for all the help they provided. 

E-gmat’s platform is a one-stop shop for all your GMAT needs. It contains a dedicated section for the verbal and quant parts of the exam, and even provides support for integrated reasoning section. Ii was super easy to use and I was able to focus all my needs in just one place. The only outside material I used was the official GMAT essays as additional preparation as I approached my exam date.

One of the things I found most convenient about e-gmat is that it gives you a personalized study plan. When I set out to start studying, I realized that there was a lot of information available on the internet, books, courses and it became a bit overwhelming the amount of options and methods I found. With e-gmat I didn't have to worry about anything at all. The platform provides a clear method that guides you step by step on how to approach your study session. It helps you define when to study what topic and in which way. The fact that they gave me a personalized study plan was an absolute relief, and it reduced many hours of preparation that I was able to put to better use by studying. 

For the verbal section, e-gmat was able to provide a very clear and structured method for addressing the questions. Although I had a strong performance in verbal from the beginning, initially I was answering the questions purely by intuition, which not only resulted in mistakes, but also made me feel insecure and nervous. Thanks to e-gmat, I was able to apply a structured thought process that helped me become much more precise in my answers and gain confidence. In addition, given the personalized study plan, I was able to focus on those areas that were the most difficult for me, and quickly review those areas where I felt more comfortable. 

In the quant section, e-gmat provides an incredible tool called PACE which diagnoses your knowledge of concepts and then gives you specific material to fill in the gaps. The tool worked wonderfully and helped me understand concepts in depth, thus avoiding having to resort to memory during a stressful situation like the GMAT exam. In addition, the number of questions offered in the database is so large that it allows you to practice constantly. At the end of a few weeks of focused practice, you can easily identify the types of question you will encounter during the GMAT test, leaving little room for surprises.

In addition to the videos and extensive question bank available, I think what I valued most about e-gmat was the study method provided, which helps you feel super confident during the test. They support you with an impressive number of taylor-made quizzes and cementing quizzes so you can make sure you absorb the concepts properly. In addition, they provide tools for the process of reviewing incorrect or time-consuming questions, which positively impacts your performance.  

After only 2-3 months using the platform conscientiously, I managed to go from a score of 640 in my first mock test to a 770 in the official exam.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took my first attempt at GMAT in 2016 when I could score only 670 after 3 months of preparation. This year I wanted to get a really good score with the help of a proper guidance, and I decided to go for eGMAT. I knew about eGMAT from my own research but I got convinced to take this course once I got recommendations from a couple of my friends.

The experience with eGMAT has been really great. Starting from the foundation course in both verbal and quant section to the advanced topics, they have captured every topic in a very detailed and structured manner. I personally needed a lot of improvement in the verbal section and I absolutely loved the way the verbal course is crafted, and the way they have created strategies to solve each SC, CR and RC question along with their subsections is amazing. They also make sure that they provide enough practice questions for these strategies so that we eventually get used to them and start using them subconsciously going-forward. The quant section is also pretty well structured, with enough practice questions for both PS and DS. I needed improvement primarily in the DS section and the strategy they offer for it is foolproof if applied correctly.

The two best things about eGMAT apart from the course is the analytics section and the personal coaching. The analytics sections provides all the details of each subsection and gives us a better view to select specific questions based on our performance in these subsections, so that we can target our weak areas and not just keep practising question from our strong areas. 
The personal coaching came into picture after my second attempt at GMAT when I scored a 710. Payal personally reached out to me after analysing my performance on eGMAT and convinced me to take another attempt at it to get a better score. This time she helped me connect with one of their consultants, Rashmi who talked to me regularly to plan my next steps within the month, focusing specifically on my weak areas. She kept me pushing and motivated throughout the journey and it felt really good to know that the counsellors in eGMAT are very much invested in our journey to make sure we reach our target. 
 
Even though I scored a 710 in my official GMAT, the scores in my eGMAT and OG mocks ranged between 730 to 780, and this exemplifies the kind of impact this course has on me, irrespective of my final score which could be because of my unfortunate luck on that day.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT prep started sometime around Nov ‘21. I gave a mock and scored 670 (Q47V35) which I knew was nowhere close to the target score which I had in mind. 
So, I immediately got to work and diligently started preparing everyday for a couple of hours in the morning before I began office work. I started with practicing questions from OG and would select 20 questions each from quant and verbal and test myself in a timed environment. My quant accuracy was good and I gradually got better with time. With Verbal my accuracy was poor and more importantly, I had huge conceptual gaps. 

So I decided to start learning verbal concepts and since I tend to do better with video based learning, I started looking for an online course to help me with this. I enrolled in eGMAT based on a recommendation from a friend and because I was impressed with a lot of their answers on GMATClub. What I liked about their answers was the fact that they followed a structured approach for solving SC questions wherein, the first emphasis was on meaning followed by litmus testing the sentence against a fixed set of grammar rules. I found this quite effective because I felt this method was easy to replicate on the exam and left very little to chance. 

After completing the course, my verbal score improved to V38 but it was still far from my target verbal score of V42. It was quite puzzling for me because I was solving questions every day but my score wasn’t improving. I reached out to eGMAT for help and they responded to me and gave me a customized plan which targeted my conceptual gaps and addressed issues in my approach. In a very short amount of time(2 weeks), my verbal score jumped from V38 to V42. I booked a test and scored 740(Q49V42). 

Here is a list of things which I did that helped me immensely in acing the GMAT. 
SC and CR: Knowing the grammatical concepts that the GMAT tests on is crucial. You can learn these concepts from a good test prep provider like eGMAT. Once you master these concepts, start practicing questions everyday in a timed environment and make sure you spend a good amount of time on questions which you failed to answer correctly. Be honest with yourself and introspect on why you got it wrong. Identify whether it is a conceptual gap, time issue, or anything else you might have faced. Once you identify your problem, take corrective actions to fix your mistakes. Making mistakes in GMAT is fine but making the same mistake twice is unacceptable. For CR, what really helped me was pre thinking. It is a practice where you read the question stem and try to prethink the answer that could answer the question. This was helpful to me because it eliminates the need to evaluate and introspect every option in depth because once you’ve prethought the answer, all you need to do is mark the answer choice that is closest to your pre thought assumption. 

RC: Being a lifelong reader, I thought RC would be a piece of cake to me. I couldn’t be more wrong. Casual readers tend to skim through content a lot but skimming equals death in the GMAT. You have to understand every sentence clearly before moving on to the next sentence. The two things to always keep in mind when you read a sentence are a. What does this sentence mean? b. What value does this sentence add to the passage as a whole? This can be a bit time taking in the beginning, but with practice it will become second nature and your RC accuracy will soar. 

General tips: 
Error log: I solved nearly 600 questions before reaching out to eGMAT for help. I solved only 150 questions when working under their tutelage. I’ve learned more from solving those 150 questions than I did from the 600 questions I solved earlier. The differentiating factor was an error log. If you make an error log and regularly refer back to your notes, you’ll make a lot more incremental progress than you would if you simply solved questions without introspection. Quality matters more than quantity when practicing. 
Read: Spend at least 15 minutes a day reading good quality content on the internet (The Economist, FT, etc.). Imagine that you are going to be questioned on the essays that you’re reading. Doing this improve your reading comprehension and will work wonders in RC and CR
Use analytics to track performance: eGMAT offers Scholaranium which is an excellent tool that contains 100s of good quality questions and amazing analytical tools to track your performance. You can very easily track your performance and check your accuracy and pace w.r.t topic, difficulty and section. I earlier did this in Excel when I was practicing from OG but it can be quite time taking and having the analytical tools in Scholarinium saved me a lot of time. 
Mocks: Take mocks periodically to track your performance. While practicing quizzes regularly helps in improving accuracy and conceptual gaps, mocks help you in learning time management, train your brain to stay active for long hours and help you stay in touch with GMAT’s adaptive algorithm. I did 5 mocks in Scholarinium and I felt that the scoring and quality of questions were quite similar to the actual test.  
Stay calm: It is good to push yourself to the limits of your capability but don’t let this affect your mental wellbeing. In the end, GMAT is just an exam. If you crack it, good, if not, life goes on. No big deal.

																			by score report","","Location","I started my GMAT prep last year and like a lot of engineers quickly realized that although my quant skills were good enough, I needed some serious help in the verbal section. Multiple close contacts recommended eGMAT to learn and strengthen verbal concepts and I can safely say that it was the right decision.
The course takes you through the basics to the advanced level and at every step challenges you with quizzes and applications. The designed method to utilize the course is the one thing I would recommend everyone to follow and also read up on the explanations given for each answer whether you are right or wrong, especially in the Application files.
The pre-thinking process for CR and RC helped me to stay objective about the question and not get swayed by preconceived notions. For SC, cementing quizzes played a critical role in building up my thinking when there is no context provided – you do not know whether the question is from the verbs or modifiers module.
The mocks are a little towards the difficult end which I felt was good as they help you time better for the actual test. The mix of questions in the mocks and quizzes helps one better time their performance which becomes essential in the later stages of the prep.
Overall, I would highly recommend the eGMAT course as it strongly builds your basics quite well, provides ample data so you can understand where you are lacking, and has an ample number of quizzes and mocks to practice in that final stretch","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","0","0","","","","","",""

But, soon I realized I used up 2 official mocks and I was stuck at 600-610 scores. V22 and Q49. 

Then, I was about to drop the GMAT altogether thinking this is not my cup of tea. But, then a friend of mine recommended me the e-GMAT course. And this gave my preparation a good spin.

I absolutely love the preparation pedagogy starting from high school grammar. Earlier, I used to hate the RC section but after the course, and the techniques I was looking forward to the RC section in the exam. Even my ESR says I have received over 90% accuracy in the RC section.

Moreover, the question banks and mocks are very gmat-like. My test scores in e-GMAT mocks and official mocks were very close. And in the last days of the preps, I felt that the mocks are starting to become easy.

One piece of advice to students - please speak with the mentors and prep strategists, they are very helpful.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my gmat preparation by solving questions from the official guide and from GMAT club . The questions were very useful for practice but the often contrasting views on a topic on the common forum caused confusion in understanding of concepts.To avoid this confusion, I decided to enroll for an online course which would help me be clear with different concepts. After some search on the web and speaking with some friends I decided to enroll for the egmat online course for 2 months.

Over the 2 months I accessed only the verbal section and mainly SC and RC as these two topics were my weak areas. The course on both these topics was highly structured and detailed. The practice questions at the end of each concept helped me gain a better understanding of each concept.

The course on SC helped me understand all the different grammer rules. After completing the course I could see significant improvements in topics such as modifiers, parallelism and comparisons. The course also gave a thorough demonstration of the method to be used to arrive at the correct answer while solving questions. This structured methodology was of great help in answering questions on the actual exam.

The course on RC, as the SC course was also very detailed and structured. The reading strategies provided were very useful in understanding how to gain proper understanding of any passage in minimum time. The insights provided on the way to approach a main point and inference question were very useful in solving questions and helped me increase my accuracy in these questions.

Post completion of the theory I began solving questions on the scholaranium section of the course. During this phase I solved a lot of questions through the cementing quizzes on each of the 3 verbal topics. The scholaranium provided me access to lot of questions where I could apply the concepts learned during the course. In addition to providing questions, the detailed solutions of the questions also helped me improve my question solving ability. After I solved some questions on the cementing quizzes I moved to giving the movk tests. Initially I struggled to solve the questions within the stipulated time as I was taking time to adjust to applying a different process of question solving. However, as I kept practicing questions I became better and was able to solve the questions within the stipulated time with a good accuracy. Consequently, my mock score also increased upto 740. Another good feature of the scholaranium was the fact that question used to get added after completion of a mock test. This ensured that I always had sufficient questions for practice. Also the analytics section in the scholaronium section helped me understand my accuracy in different type of questions and gave me an understanding on the topics on which I was supposed to work.

After i felt confident to give the gmat I booked a slot for the exam. I ended up getting a score of 760 with a 41 in the verbal section. The egmat course on SC and RC played an important role in helping me achieve this score.

Overall I would recommend the egmat verbal course for anyone looking for a structured and detailed way of learning. An important point in getting maximum advantage from the course is consistent practive. Consistent practice is very important if one has to gain expertise in solving questions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Congratulations on your score of 760 and becoming a member of the top 1 percentile test takers! It is by no means an easy feat to achieve a Q50 (87th percentile) in Quant and a V41 (93rd percentile) in Verbal. 

It is great to see that you immediately understood that just solving questions online with so many contrasting views on every concept will not work. Understanding the concepts is an integral part of GMAT preparation.   

You brought a structure to your approach to the GMAT. You first learned all the concepts clearly and only then you came to the Scholaranium to master those concepts through cementing quizzes. With the help of meaning-based approach in SC and reading strategies in RC, you improved your accuracies in Verbal which can be seen below in the image through your phenomenal Verbal statistics –

You rightly mentioned that consistency is the most important aspect. You were consistent with your preparation because of which you kept on increasing your accuracies. The below image shows not just you improved your accuracy in topics such as Subject Verb, Verbs and Pronouns from 60% to 73%, but also you improved your timing per question from 2 minutes to 1 minute 36 seconds.

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT journey started in 2018, at that point of time I tried various platforms, such as Offline Coaching, GMAT Club question sets, Manhattan Test Series, e-GMAT etc., for my preparations. I spent around 6 months on preparations and gave 3 attempts back to back. Needless to mention my performance was dismal and I ended up with:
•	680 on Ist attempt
•	640 on IInd attempt (Score Cancelled)
•	630 on IIIrd attempt (Score Cancelled)
With this score I couldn’t get into any B School of my choice, and finally gave up on my MBA dream. Fast forward 5 yrs, I got married and am doing good in my career but couldn’t really stop thinking about MBA and the momentum it provides to the career.
So, I decided to write GMAT one last final time. Because of my previous experience, e-GMAT was my obvious first choice. I started my preps in Dec’21 and religiously followed the course structure recommended by them. During the course of preparation, I made following mistakes, which I realized later and ultimately had to spend more time, later, to correct them:
•	Skipping the Master Comprehension part. Supposing that it is not required, since it is not evaluated on exam.
•	Skipping the videos of certain topics that I believed I knew.
•	Not viewing the solution video. Cause solution generally tend to be of 10+ minutes, so I either played the video on 2x speed or didn’t view it entirely. 
•	Being overconfident about Quant – supposing that I knew all the concepts and hence spent only 6-8 hrs in entire quant preparation.
•	Not maintaining the error log properly.
•	Focusing on attempting more and more no. of questions.
Because of these things I ultimately ended up re-doing the modules and ultimately adding few more months to the timeline.
What I liked about e-GMAT:
•	Structured modules – Each section of e-GMAT is structured in such a way that you can actually implement the learnings of one in another. Moreover, the structuring of Practice Quiz & Application files helps to learn and implement the concepts in a much handy way.
•	Analytics: Whether it be analytics around time spent in a particular module or around the Scholaranium, it helped in providing extremely helpful insights about the weaker sections. Moreover, the analysis of the time spent in a particular question helped me to drastically reduce the time taken in RC & CR. It also helped me identify the weaker areas in SC and do a targeted practice around the same.
•	Error Log: I think it is the most undervalued thing in the whole preparation :D. At first, I was not maintaining it religiously but learnt its importance, the harder way. It is extremely important as in the last phases of your preparation, when you’ve attempted 100+ questions, it is very important to understand and not repeat your mistakes. The key is not to practice more and more questions, but to learn and not repeat the same mistake. 
•	Support from e-GMAT experts:  As a student when you’ve been preparing for 6+ months, one tends to lose patience, overlook the obvious signs of un-preparedness, and schedule an appointment in a hurry. The same happened with me. After 2 sigma mock tests, I was like I should take a date for next week. 
Fortunately for me, all through my journey I had been actively writing to the support team and seeking their suggestion. In the end when I was restless and impatient to schedule an appointment, it was Support team who analyzed my performance and helped me identify the areas that needed more practice and improvement. Though the exercise took me 1 more months but it helped me be more confident in Verbal and Quant. 

Many of us feel shy to reach out to Support team, thinking that they might not respond or may take long to reply. But believe me, always reach out to people, seek their support, and make them a part of your journey. People do respond. And the same was true for e-GMAT support team also.


Lastly I would like to add that GMAT is a game of patience. Plz keep your mind cool and don’t let the monotony or self-inflicted deadlines make you go in a hurry.

May the force be with you, All the best ","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started considering applying for deferred MBA admissions back in September 2021. The first thing that comes up with regards to any school admissions is - the standardized test requirements. Coming from an over-represented group (Indian Engineers), I would have to ace the GMAT (read - about 20 to 30 points above the general median) in order to not have standardized prep as a weaker part of the application.

I started with taking an official GMAT mock test, and I received a 690 (Q50 V34). While taking the mock test, I quickly realized that I would have to focus my preparation for the verbal section, and in particular, the Sentence Correction section of the test, thanks to the level of discomfort I was having with it. After reviewing the test, it became clear to me that I will need to focus on the foundations of grammar, and develop a knack of checking not just for the meanings (which I was reasonably comfortable with), but also for the grammar.

I started looking for some resources, and I came across e-GMAT. From the introductory videos and reviews, it became very clear to me that their test prep relied a lot on correctness and developing fundamentals, instead of trying to teach some GMAT-specific ‘hacks’/solutions. This approach seemed really charming to me given my target of having a high GMAT Score. Thus, I took up the GMAT Online 360 course from e-GMAT.
I focused particularly on the SC section since I saw the most value in improving my weakest section. I started following the foundational topics, and covered most (if not all of them) with attention to detail so as to develop the grammatical foundations. I would at times try to ‘skip’ the learnings by jumping into cementing exams, but I could see no improvements then, and therefore decided to continue covering all the topics. Once I completed the SC course contents, I made the novice decision of taking the GMAT with no exam temperament (ie. no practice of taking the GMAT mocks). In my first attempt, I scored a V730 (Q50, V39). 

In my fist exam, I realized the importance of being able to reduce the time I took for solving the SC questions, especially given that I was receiving very long sentences and I could see that despite my ability to solve these questions, I was taking up too much time to reach the solution, thus leading to an incomplete verbal section attempt. Once again, I focused on improving my SC score by taking the cementing tests (especially the medium and hard categories). After each test, I made sure that I would go through the questions I had a bit of guesswork involved (by flagging such questions), the incorrect answers, and the questions in which I took up a bit too much of time (both obtained via the xPERT engine). I would also make sure to review the concepts that I would deem necessary. In particular, I had focused tremendously on the modifiers section, especially the verb-ing and the verb-ed forms.

After the cementing tests, I took the official GMAT mocks and the Sigma-X mocks. The Sigma-X mocks were tremendously helpful since they were tougher than the actual GMAT Exam, and therefore I was very well prepared for any hick-ups during the actual exam. After a month of preparation, I took the GMAT again, this time with a score of 760 (Q51, V40),  just enough to apply to my target B-schools with a sense of comfort.
As far as the course is concerned, I have been able to learn a lot about the fundamentals of grammar, written English, and the importance of unambiguous sentences. The course will not just help in GMAT (the prime focus of the course), but it should also help with written English - right from comprehension to developing a knack of writing unambiguous text.
I would recommend the e-GMAT course for anyone who is looking:

1. To learn from the fundamentals - throughout the journey, I never found any ‘hacks’ to solve a question. I cannot stress enough how important this is for a high GMAT score. Take it from someone who has done reasonably well in multiple standardized exams :)

2. To truly excel in the test- the e-GMAT course goes above and beyond to prepare for the worst-case scenarios during the actual test. While the course may seem daunting at the beginning, the actual test will feel like a breeze.
3. To use data-driven analytics in their prep: The X-PERT engine does really well in finding out the gaps in the preparation through its cementing and mock tests. Any candidate can use the analytics to fill in the gaps by revisiting these topics.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi guys,

I started with egmat from absolute zero. I was out of the habit of studying and had done Maths about 5 years back. My English too was all over the place. So, egmat helped me with getting that rust off my verbal and quantitative skills.

I loved their Verbal course the most. I remember a session that Payal had hosted on SC. The title said something like, ""How to solve an SC question in under 60 secs"". I said to myself, ""Another gimmicky company"". But when I sat for my actual test, I was actually solving almost all SC questions in under 60 secs. The jump in my ability happened because I just mimicked the way Payal used to solve SC questions in their SC module. 

Step 1: Break the stimulus/ argument into smaller pieces. Pause while reading at strategic moments. Then absorb the meaning of the sentence.
Step 2: Look for S-V pairs, pronoun errors, modifiers, comparisons, idioms, redundancy, etc.

This systematic approach, if followed diligently, cuts down the time ""significantly"". And that's why I got a V42 in the actual exam.

I believe that one of the most underrated stuff that egmat helps you with is- ""Reading skills"". To learn ""effectively"" is a very underrated skill. If you don't have that down, you will suffer tremendously in the exam. More so because, during exams, ""nerves"" come into play. And if you have not developed a systematic ""Reading skill"" then you will speed-read stuff in some panicky situations and start getting easy questions wrong. That's where GMAT punishes the test-takers the most.

So, just try to imitate Payal when reading a stimulus or breaking down an argument. After some time, it would become your natural habit.

The last but important aspect of egmat is their support. Dhananjay (DJ) and Shradhha are absolute GEMS. DJ would give you reality checks whereas Shradhha would answer all your ""Verb-ing"" modifier queries with utmost patience. I remember I used to trouble her a lot with questions on ""Verb-ing modifier"". So for that, ""Shradhha, I am sorry"". And to DJ, ""I did it man!"".

A word of caution: I did their Quant course the wrong way. They have a structure in place, but I didn't follow it. If you happen to take the course, try to follow the structure they have in place. I can't write it all about it here, but in short, ""Trust them with your time and money"", and ""contact their support"" when in doubt.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=47#","0","0","","","","","",""

"July 16, 2022","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","HOW I WENT FROM A 520 (in my mocks) TO A 740  THANKS TO EGMAT","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","In my first year of undergrad, it was as I was searching for information about what  the gmat as an exam entailed,  that I stumbled upon a comprehensive explanation of the same on the first website that I clicked. 
The egmat website.
The blog post there offered an extremely thorough, easy to understand overview of the exam and its sections, what a percentile score really meant, and why the gmat as an exam might be right for you.
The clarity provided through this post was what I would say,  solidified my desire to attempt the exam and piqued my interest in learning more about what egmat as a platform had to offer regarding the same.

The very next day, as I went through the free modules offered, I marveled at how easily a  concept such as ' +ing- modifiers' that i had struggled to retain post  my elementary school days, was one that I was able to understand through the concept file illustrations and then apply almost immediately after being taught the concept, in an interactive application file quiz.

That very evening, I booked a free strategy consultation with one of their experts and was introduced to Vaibhav, who helped me chart out my gmat goals, taking into consideration my time commitments and strengths and urged me to avail their free sigma x mock test to have a better understanding of where it is that I stood, not just in terms of my cumulative quant and verbal ability, but also in terms of my sectional ability in each of the subsections under verbal and quant.

The fact that egmat offers a sigma x mock test that uses analytics to provide the following information to *everyone* for free is almost akin to a godsend, and I can tell you with complete certainty, that attempting that mock test regardless of where it is that you are at your gmat prep journey or how it is that you are prepping , will be a game changer for you.

What set egmat apart for me was the transparency with which every step of the process was detailed.  
The meticulous 3 step approach that is explained to you, the personalised study plan that is offered, that takes into consideration your strengths, commitments and goals, the access to a student forum that allows you to see other queries posted on a topic, ask your own, with the guarantee of receiving a response within 24 hours, and the active involvement of a team of strategy experts that are there for you at every step of the way, were all attributes that I was made aware of on that very first day itself, and is what motivated me to purchase the course.

On my very first mock test, i scored a 520 ( 26th percentile; Q31 , V31)  and the analytics for the same was what was used by the egmat testprep company to help chart out an action plan that was tailored specifically for me. 

By the end of my gmat journey, what i had achieved was a  220 point improvement from my intial score , with my final score of 740 ( 97th percentile ; Q47, V45).


Below,  i shall enumerate some of the reasons why EGMAT 'works' :

1. They do not promise you instant miracles. Instead, you are guaranteed 'improvement'  over a period of time, provided you follow the plan charted out for you.
 I was given reasonable targets at different stages of my gmat journey - to grow from 520 to 570 , 570 to 620, 620 to 650, 650 to 680, 680 to 710, and then 710 to 740+.

2. Stage 1 of each module entails a diagnostic quiz for you to figure out where it is you stand, and on the basis of your performance on that, through the PACE feature of the course, you are told which module files you must work on and what you can skip, effectively saving you time during your prep.

3. Each concept file within a module is followed by a timed test that replicates an online mini exam. So, even for 5 questions, you are given a test that is timed for say 15 minutes, I.e, the amount of time they find you should ideally take to solve those questions. 
In addition to this, there are also untimed process and application learning files, where you can take your time solving one question, before being shown a video solution of the same that maps out the process skills to be used and breaks down the steps to solving that question.
Since several of the questions on learning files of this kind are usually gmat style questions of medium-hard difficulty , the approach followed to teach you how to solve these questions is very effective in cementing the method in your mind.

4. SUPPORT + VALIDATION. The gmat journey can often be a lonely one. The impact of the lows felt may sometimes erode one's confidence , and the lack of check-ins at regular intervals may just adversely affect the 'accountability' you may take in your learning process.
 Egmat recognises this, and thus, makes it a point to validate not just the final score, but also the effort you put along the way at every level in your journey.
Emails that celebrate your performance on the final application/ practice quizzes of each module are sent when you score greater than 85 percent on them and they serve to affirm to you that you're on the right track in your journey.
In addition to this , the support team of strategy experts are just an email away, there for you to reach out to when things 'Do Not Go According To Plan'. They are quick in their responses, efficient in their communication, and possess the right balance of  empathy and firmness as they chart out improvement plans for you.
My strategy expert Harsha was someone i sent extremely lengthy emails too, detailing not just my progress on good days but also the sheer panic i felt when things didn't go according to plan. At one point in time, i think i even sent him my timetable for the day, asking him how i could rework it better! Strategy experts like Harsha, I found,  went above and beyond in the role they played - doubling as progress trackers, motivators, problem solvers, and even life coaches!
In addition to this, my subscription, which was set to expire on the 26th of June, was extended free of charge until the 1st of july  (the date of my gmat) so I could access the resources and produce optimized results on my final exam.
All of this is indeed something that I will always be indebted to egmat for.

5. Cementing
The cementing approach to strengthen your understanding of not just the concepts learned in stage 1 but also their application in all possible types of gmat style questions, is by far the most life changing aspect of this programme.
You are taught to identify several process skills like I.simplification, ii. Translation, iii. Consider constraints, iv. All cases and so on while learning a concept in stage 1. In stage 2, it is as you are giving your medium and hard level tests on their cementing platform called Scholaranium, that you are taught how to make an error log to efficiently identify your errors, record your learnings and create an effective review system that saves you time down the line in your final revision process.
The error log approach compels you to go beyond the traditional reasoning of a 'silly mistake' or ' took too much time' (in fact, egmat maintains fervently that there is no such thing as a silly mistake) for incorrect questions and delve deeper into which process skill you might have overlooked and pin point exactly which part of the application stage you may have faltered in.
The goal here is to change how you respond to errors - and to encourage you direct your focus from "" what went wrong"" to identifying "" why it went wrong"".
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call this the most 'crucial' takeaway for your gmat prep.
I can assure you that this  cementing process, when done properly, is what takes your learning to the next level - gets you that 85th percentile and above accuracy and instills in you,  unwavering belief in your ability to take on any question posed to yoy on the final day.


6. Other features like a focused approach to work on your TAKT time on questions where you exceed the time it should take to solve a particular question or topic, curated review lists for each test that highlight the questions you may have exceeded time for or rushed through in, with a threshold time offered as  information to evaluate your performance against, the ability to bookmark questions so you can review them later by simply clicking on your user profile, and even a forum that allows you to review other student queries posted on a topic and ask your own,  are also what sets egmat apart as the perfect learning platform for anyone looking to improve.

Looking back at my gmat journey, for all the learning curves that i did end up experiencing, for the bumps and stumbles, and even the things that I wished i'd done differently along the way, i know that the one decision that i can say with certainty that I will be eternally grateful for making, is choosing egmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

However, I was very lost and did not approach the prep with a plan (I ended up scoring 660 way below my aim). This is where I believe E-GMAT’s biggest strength lies. After Joining, I was given a study plan by the team and followed it diligently, more importantly, you can reach out to the E-GMAT team and ask for guidance any time you get stuck. E-GMAT also provides a very structured way through error logs which ensures that you learn from every question you get incorrect along the preparation journey, which was transformational in the way I approached my studies.  

I also wanted to highlight E-GMAT’s modules, which are very well structured and ensure that you completely understand any topic before moving on. They do this by sprinkling in quizzes after every video, providing lesson summaries (which make for great notes for revision), and making you do ‘cementing quizzes’. Also, the team’s video lessons contain a standardized process for every topic which helps in solving hard questions in a relatively timely manner. Many of the verbal courses especially were eye-opening and made me realize how I was not approaching the section correctly at all. 

The team has many more features which I was unable to mention in the review.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Prior to e-GMAT, I had no other strategy besides continuously working on questions, believing that by working on many different problems, I will cover all the question types that I might encounter during the exam. Also, I was not structured in my study approach, often jumping from one topic / section to another without fully grasping the techniques required to excel in the test, especially in the verbal section. Come test day, it was not a surprise that I only managed score a V34 in the test, with my total score amounting to a 710 (Q50, V34, IR 7, AWA 6.0), even after 2+ months of preparation.
I actually stumbled upon the e-GMAT course 3 days prior to my 710 attempt. When going through the free version of the platform, I thought that the materials were very succinct and informative (essentially a one-stop shop for everything GMAT), with Scholaranium, in particular, serving as the perfect companion to ensure I put into practice what I have learn from the platform. So, upon receiving my results, it was a no brainer for me to immediately sign up for the full version e-GMAT as I wish to take my next attempt exactly a month later.
With the help of the e-GMAT platform, I was able to be more focus and structured in my preparation especially in my weaker areas in the verbal section. The lessons I learned during my preparation are as listed below:
SC 
-	Understanding the key message the author is trying to convey is utmost important. It is the essence of the sentence.
-	Meaning > Grammar. The are times where sentences are grammatically correct but conveys a different meaning to the original sentence.
-	Often, grammar errors can be identified using logic. Equipped with the meaning-based approach and a strong arsenal of grammatical knowledge, the wrong answers can frequently be viewed as illogical.
CR
-	Pre-thinking the answers for yourself goes a long way in not only building your ability to solve higher difficulty questions, but also your ability to do so within a short amount of time.
-	Identifying the purpose of each sentence within the argument will help in ensuring you do not deviate from the main focus of the argument.
-	Refrain from looking at the answer choices first for you will be immediately attached to it, stifling your ability to pre-think effectively.
RC
-	Be engaged while reading the passage. There is a reason the section is called “Reading Comprehension” and not just “Reading”.
-	Take short notes while reading to identify the message behind each paragraph. It will help in solving questions relatively quickly, especially for questions that require one to make an inference.
Equipped with knowledge and lessons above, I was able to improve my score to a 740. (Q49, V41, IR 8, AWA 6.0)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I have read several stories on this forum for the past two years - every one of them have helped me carve my path; This post is NOT a story about someone who scored an amazing score in her/his first attempt, instead it is about someone who struggled her way to a 730 score. I will try to keep it as informative and to the point as possible. 

As I started my GMAT journey Verbal was my main concern, however, after exploring some materials and attempting few mocks I came to realise that though my Quantitative ability was strong my test taking strategies were not up to the mark, acting as a roadblock to a high score.  After studying several GMAT Official and GMAT Club materials,  I could improve my Quantitative score to Q48 GMAT Club Quant tests: They more difficult than the actual GMAT but they prepare you to face difficult questions in GMAT) , and I still struggled with application of verbal concepts that I learned - V34 in Feb'21  was the maximum I could score at that point. Then a friend of mine suggested eGMAT - yes, I had read plenty of reviews and saw multiple ads, but you can never be sure, right? So, I signed up for a 1 month Verbal Online course in March 2021. As I progressed through the course I kept re-purchasing and then ended up taking a 6 month Verbal course with eGMAT. Here is the reason why -
      •	Prior to eGMAT course I was solving questions from GMAT Club, Official guide, etc. , looking for learnings, and moving to the next one. But in the eGMAT course there is an Application file, after every concept, that ensures that you go through the logical steps of solving a question. It was tiresome to follow the steps for every question, but the thought process here was one that was in sync with mine, every small little ""what if?"" or ""but, what about?"" that popped in my head was covered. So, I decided to stick to the process.

      •	Once I crossed the cementing stage I realised that I was not making a conscious effort to follow the steps, instead the thought process came naturally to me, hence it wasn't that time consuming anymore.

Trying to juggle GMAT prep and a very demanding high-pressure job, the time pressure took the better of me during my GMAT attempt in Nov'21 (V27). But the eGMAT team went an extra mile to follow-up and encourage me to fight back.  This is the point at which I realised that eGMAT is not just about the students who do well in their first attempt but helping the ones who are struggling too. The subject matter experts and strategy experts are very approachable and involved in your journey (I always received a response from the team within 36 hrs). A big shout-out to Harsha who guided me every step of the way in terms of subject matter on RC and CR, and strategy when it comes to SC and Quant, and encouraged me to keep going. After my Nov'21 attempt I was so disappointed that during my session with Harsha I told him ""I feel like I cannot  get a decent score under pressure no matter how much I study"". To which Harsha showed and explained to me the statistics from my tests on Scholarium that gave a comprehensive analysis of my performance on GMAT like questions and Official questions; This re-assurance about my ability encouraged me to keep going. 
      •	I reviewed my AI guided stats on the Scholarium portal and identified that there were few aspects of Quant that could help me get that Q50+. Hence, I signed up for a full GMAT Online course and followed every step of the detailed plan suggested by Harsha and team. 
              o The PACE mode in Quant helped me move through the concepts quickly and focus on only the areas which required improvement
      •	I followed a detailed and personalised revision plan for RC and SC and a timing improvement plan for CR. These plans really helped bring structure to my preparation. 

Finally, at the risk of repeating what every other post might have highlighted, it is the error log - It is painful to fill and takes much more time than the time taken to solve the questions, but it is essentially what helped me improve the most. And, eGMAT actually provides a very comprehensive error log that captures a lot of the nuances that I could've otherwise missed.
         o	Timing was my main concern in the test. There were two aspects of time during the exam :
                    1.	I often ran out of time towards the end of the exam because I spent a lot of time trying to ensure I was getting each question correct. 
                              •	This stemmed from the notion that I knew the necessary concepts hence, I couldn't let a question go. Yes, letting some questions go, was the most important lesson I learned while analysing my mocks.
This is one aspect that was not stressed upon a lot during my eGMAT experience, but it came handy in my case.
                    2.	The fact that I might run out of time at the end played in my head as soon as I got confused or started taking longer in a question - This, in turn, impacted my ability on that question.

Thus, I reviewed my error log for the 10-question set quizzes to understand when and where do I get confused, what kind of wordings in the answer choices confuse me, does it have anything to do with my understanding of the question stem or passage, etc. As I worked through these aspects, the next time I was in a similar situation I knew what to do, this helped me avoid the confusion, and as a result save time.   
This video helped me understand how and where I can manage time:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INmDqeVjB04 

As I came close to the exam I focused on Official questions (from Official Guide and Advanced Official questions by GMAC) to practice and get accustomed to them. 

By now, I was tired of preparing for GMAT, but this time around I felt confident about my ability, and honestly a positive attitude and faith in your efforts as you walk into that exam centre is as important as the months/years of effort that goes into the preparation.
And finally the score popped-up on the screen 730 (Q50 V40)! 

To those who are currently fighting for that score, this quote I heard in the TV series The Good Doctor kept me going - ""You haven't failed until you stop trying!"". I hope my experience helps you in your GMAT journey. 
All the Best! Hang in there!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I purchased the e-GMAT course after getting a disappointing score in the verbal section of the first official mock test that I attempted before starting my prep for the GMAT exam. 

Before giving the mock test, I was very confident with my fluency in English and expected to sail through the verbal section. However, after seeing the result, I realized that the scope of the verbal section in very different from the “Spoken English” that we Indians are accustomed to. I understood that in order to get a good score, I would need to develop a strategy to tackle each type of question in the verbal section. This is where e-GMAT was a game changer. 

SC – The course helped me understand all the grammatical rules that constitute a correct sentence. However, what really helped me tackle tricky 700+ questions is the Meaning-Driven sentence analysis methodology that I learned from Payal. Understanding the intended meaning is paramount when it comes to selecting the correct option, especially in the case of tricky 700+ questions that offer multiple grammatically correct options. 

CR – Pre-Thinking is crucial when it comes to tackling CR questions. It took me a lot less time to answer hard questions after I started using the Pre-thinking strategy. The main advantage of this approach is that you already know what to look for before even going through the options.

Scholaranium – I practiced a lot of questions on the Scholaranium. Both the verbal and quant sections really test your abilities. The folks at e-GMAT have done a great job at developing a verbal section that matches the official exam.  

Highly recommend e-GMAT if you too are struggling with Verbal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","0","0","","","","","",""

In fact, I was confidently able to answer all the SC questions that appeared  on the main day. 

The scholaranium is also a great platform to practice questions on. In fact, the e-gmat questions are really close in structure to the official questions, something that I found lacking in a few other GMAT courses. This really helps in building a strong base to answer questions on the main day.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started with my GMAT Journey in January of 2021. Since I was in the final year of college and had sometime on my hands, I decided to give gmat a shot. I started my preparation by purchasing the official guides, and I started solving some questions from these guides. After a few months I realised that my preparation did not have any formal structure and that I was going around in circles. This was in the November of 2021. I had taken 5 Manhattan Mocks and was scoring in the range of 620-640. I realised that I was desperately in need of a structured preparation plan. I reached out to the egmat team and got on a call with Manas Sadana to discuss my problems. He guided me through the details of the egmat plan and I really liked the overall program structure and processes. I decided to enrol. 

I started off with Sentence Correction and went on to Quant and finished the course with CR and RC. With EGMAT, every sub topic has a structural improvement plan to guide students with different level of abilities- if I was strong in Geometry, the AI driven insights would guide me in a way that I only had to study limited content. This helped me save time in my preparation and focus only on my weak areas and keep working towards improvement. After completing the course, I would undergo the process of cementing to ensure that I hit my target abilities in each subsection. Taking these quizzes would enable me to deal with GMAT like questions and strengthen my process abilities. In each question, the course provides the students with forum posts related to the doubts and issues faced by the students. This would allow me to resolve my doubts and also strengthen my conceptual understanding. I could also post fresh doubts that would get resolved within 2-3 business days by the egmat team. The mentors for Verbal- including Harsha, Kanupriya, Stacey, Shraddha would provide excellent support on the forum. On the quant side also we had Bikramjit, Krishna and several others who would provide detailed solutions to each problem.

Coming to the mock stage- I gave 6 mocks before sitting for the exam over a time period of 1 month (I gave weekly mocks). During this phase, I was assigned a mentor to guide me through my preparation - Kanupriya Sharma. The mock phase is one of the most important stages of preparation and having Kanupriya’s guidance every step of the way helped me structure my improvement plan and work on my weak areas after doing a detailed mock analysis. I would take a mock on the weekend and Kanupriya would help me put together an improvement plan that I could work on during the week before my next mock. I was scoring 710-720 in most of my mocks. However, 4 days before the main exam I scored a 560 in Official Mock 6. I became extremely stressed upon seeing such a drop in my score but Kanupriya guided me and helped me work on a small improvement plan in the last 2 days of my preparation. Her support really helped me regain my confidence and I was able to ensure that I remain calm enough to make it through till the exam day. To regain my confidence, Kanupriya suggested that I take a final mock 2 days before the exam. I scored a 720 in this mock. I was able to regain some level of calm and composure upon seeing this score.

Exam Day- I had an 8 am slot at the Pearson Noida exam centre. I reached there in time and overall had a smooth exam experience. I ended up with a 710 (Q51,V34,IR-6,AWA-5.5).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","To prepare for the GMAT I knew that I had to focus on Verbal side, because my math was already strong. I used one of the already well-known platforms and prepared for about 6 weeks. I got a 700 Q49 and V35. After all that preparation my verbal was still weak, and I knew it because I wasn’t feeling confident when answering the questions. I started to explore other options, talking to friends and reading reviews. Many people pointed me out to E-GMAT, especially for the verbal section. 
When I wrote to them describing my situation and my need to improve in Verbal, within a couple of hours someone wrote me back proposing to have a Zoom call, stating that I needed a specialized plan to achieve my target score. I was already overwhelmed; I was used to the typical bot e-mails from the other platforms that do nothing but get you on your nerves, because you know they ain’t made for you. After having the Zoom call with the E-GMAT expert, we looked at my ESR and went on with a specialized plan for me. I started right away with the SC module.
The SC module is the best course that I could find for GMAT…by FAR. It is so well designed to help you tackle SC questions. I barely made any mistakes after doing the course and was feeling 200% confident. The meaning approach method is the KEY. Meaning is everything in SC, I am telling you this from experience. On my first attempt, after reading option A, I went directly looking for splits; that is not the right way. If you get the meaning right, then the rest comes alone. Therefore, I was feeling ready to go for the GMAT again and starting taking mock exams that the platform offers you. Since I was still struggling with CR and RC, I wasn’t getting to my target score. It was there when Payal, co-founder of E-GMAT, wrote to me personally. She is so deeply committed with the students of E-GMAT that she does a routine audit of student progression. She noticed that though I was doing some things right, I wasn’t getting other things right and gave me specific instructions on how to proceed with my hyper-specific study plan. Payal then assigned me to Rida, one of the experts from E-GMAT. Rida really helped me plan everything. She gave me insights into my performances based on my Scholoranium performances. She continuously helped me create a plan to improve my weak areas until I was finally ready to move on. Overall, I had a wonderful experience with Rida and I would really recommend her.
I then continued with the CR course, and although it does not have many concepts to master, the pre-thinking approach used by E-GMAT really helped me master CR. It helped me understand the importance of classifying the arguments into conclusions and premises and pre-think all the possible approaches to work on it. I then finished the verbal section with the RC course, which is centered around really getting the meaning of the passage, by connecting sentences and inferring what the authors intends to say, emphasizing not to read fast or skip-read, but take your time to understand the passage. In the end, it takes you less time because you don’t have to come back to the passage for every question.
Finally, I would also give a 100% vow for the Scholaranium platform and question bank. It includes detailed analytics on sub-sections that make it so easy to identify your weak and strong areas. Scholaranium also includes 5 mocks, which are almost the same to the real exam (and I’ve tried many free mocks from different sources, all have flaws and do not resemble the real exam).
Summing up, having tried other platforms, E-GMAT is the very best among the market. If I were you, I wouldn’t doubt a second about choosing it, especially if you are struggling in Verbal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=48#","0","0","","","","","",""

The e-GMAT Verbal course (especially SC and CR) is very comprehensive and very well planned. For someone like me who did not know where to start and how to proceed with learning, the course provided a very good structure which was easy to follow. 

It seemed too tedious at times, but I trusted the hard work put in by the course creators and followed them diligently. It has everything, right from learning the basics to methods for problem-solving. There is a reason behind the extensive course and the taught methodologies. They make problem-solving intuitive and fast. I fully embraced the course and only slightly tweaked the taught methods to suit my style. 

After completing the course, one moves on to Cementing Quizzes which establish test readiness. There is even a thorough process prescribed to approach these quizzes. Following this method completely was also very crucial. The ‘Scholaranium’ not only provided loads of questions to practise but also helped in reviewing progress and highlighting areas to improve. 

I maintained a detailed Error Log as recommended. It seemed like a waste of time at first glance but was very important in providing focus and direction to my preparation.

The advice to write down a summary for each paragraph in RC was very helpful. The Scholaranium was also very useful for practising RC passages.

e-GMAT was a major reason behind my 99th percentile in SC and 91st percentile in CR. Thank you e-GMAT.

P.S.: I additionally solved all the questions in the GMAT Official Guide at least once.

Rajat (CEO of e-GMAT) himself send me a video the next day after my first attempt to tell me what could be the issues in my process and what I am missing. In the next 40 days, I followed that process dilligently and got the results. Even in the last 2 weeks, Harsha (one of the e-GMAT experts) kept in touch with me to make sure I select the right date for my GMAT and I am completely ready for it. 
Honestly, anyone thinking of GMAT should definitely consider e-GMAT and I assure you that if you follow their process and methods dilligently, you will see the desired results.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=49#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started GMAT prep in 2020 during the first covid lockdown. I tried all my ways to improve my concepts. I tried every online free source available but could not improve myself for one long year. After a year of self-study, I attempted for GMAT and scored a 600.  I was shocked to see my score and decided to give a break to myself. After that, I started looking out for online programs for the GMAT. I listened to all the webinars and checked all the reviews.  I found that while the other options that I explored were more focused on providing short-cuts and so-called smart tricks to ace the GMAT, e-Gmat focussed on mastering concepts and processes, an approach that appealed to me.

How did e-GMAT help me?

1. The verbal course of e-GMAT is the best in class. It starts with Master Comprehension which helps us understand how to comprehend any sentence or problem in Verbal as well as Quant. Moreover, the meaning-based approach emphasised by E-GMAT is the best to solve hard questions, which can never be answered by just knowing the grammatical rules. Earlier, I used to solve verbal questions using short-cuts. However, as soon as I started applying a meaning-based approach, my accuracy started to increase and this led to a major increase in my confidence as well. The meaning-based approach made everything so easy and interesting that I never found it boring ever again. I started enjoying practising SC questions as well. The application quizzes in the verbal course are really helpful in understanding the whole process of solving a question and improving every skill required to master it. 
2. Although CR does not have many concepts to master, the pre-thinking approach used by e-GMAT really helped me master CR. It helped me understand the importance of classifying the arguments into conclusions and premises and pre-think all the possible approaches to work on it. 
3. RC has been my weakest area throughout. However, the master-comprehension approach and meaning-based approach helped me to read the passages with full understanding. I never had to go back to the passage again if I read it using the master comprehension approach. This really helped me to gain better accuracy and speed in RC. 
4. Quant course gives a detailed understanding of all the concepts in quant and it really helps in leaving no concept untouched. Earlier, I used to apply short-cut approaches in quant as well. However, the level of understanding I gained from the e-GMAT helped me solve each and every question with a proper process and understanding. the e-GMAT quant course is really intensive and the Scholoranium 2.0 really helps to diagnose the weak areas and focus on them. The scholoranium 2.0 provides a diagnostic quiz, based on which, you can diagnose the areas where you are weak and require more attention. Moreover, the process and GMAT quizzes are really helpful in attaining the right efficiency for the test day. 

The e-GMAT analytics-based portal is truly commendable. All the insights provided by the e-GMAT portal are very useful to work on areas that require the most attention. The portal helps us understand our efficiency in all the topics in both Verbal and Quant. Moreover, it also helps us to track the time of each and every question and helps us achieve optimum efficiency. With the help of this portal, I could focus on my weak areas and track my efficiency throughout. The course also provides the scholoranium, which has n number of questions in both Quant and Verbal. The custom and cementing quizzes based on these scholoranium questions really helped me to improve my performance and track it in every way possible. Moreover, the Sigma-X mock provided by e-GMAT is a real gem. I guess these are the only mocks apart from the official mock that adapts on a real-time basis, just like GMAT, and also contains questions equivalent to the difficulty of the actual GMAT. Moreover, the mock analysis provided at the end is a very very detailed analysis of one’s mock performance. This tracks every question, every block, difficulty level, timing and whatnot. One can get all the required insights to improve their performance based on this mock analysis. 

Lastly, the kind of support you get during the entire duration of the course is worth mentioning. I was given the opportunity to enrol on ‘The Last Mile Program’, wherein Rida, one of the e-GMAT experts, helped me during the last stage of the GMAT prep journey. Rida really helped me plan everything. She gave me insights into my performances based on my Scholoranium and Sigma-X performances. She continuously helped me create a plan to improve my weak areas until I was finally ready to give the GMAT. The plans she provided were a real gem at the last moment of my journey and really helped me to upscale my performance. She was always ready to help and used to respond spontaneously too. Overall, I had a wonderful experience with Rida and I would recommend her 10/10.

																			by score report","Points","Location","SCORE DISCREPANCY: 
As an Globally renowned institute of authority, and my mentors who are responsible for my score, it would be great, if e-GMAT (Ms. Payal & Mr. Rajat) took up my case and clarified the anomaly with mba.com and GMAC. 
This will not just help me, but also help e-GMAT guide its students in a better way. 
Q48 and V40 leads to a score of 720: courtesy GMAC Official practice tests. A Q48 & V41 SHOULD lead to a score of 720+. 

E- GMAT PREP REVIEW: 
Now coming to why e-GMAT is one of the best prep courses for a 700+ score on the GMAT:  
1.	One-of-a-kind analytics: 
•	Customized timed plans based on your current skills 
•	Zeroing down to your each strength and weakness; and suggesting a plan to improve the latter. They actually have graphs tracking your progress as you go. 
2.	Mentorship support: 
•	I was mentored by DJ first, and Harsha later. During our long back and forth emails, we discussed everything from difficult CR questions, to testing strategy. His mentorship advice is as comprehensive as his Verbal dissections. 
•	Towards the end, Harsha gave me detailed plans to follow every day- what to revise, what to practice, what to score on quizzes. Super helpful. 
3.	Great content: 
a)	Verbal: 
•	SC- If you’re an English buff who solves SC questions by selecting what sounds right, you’ll likely falter on this section in the exam. e-GMAT’s meaning- based approach along with the detailed grammar lessons are your go to- s. 
•	CR- The pre- thinking approach was a game changer. 
•	RC- Read The Economist daily and read the entire passage- once, carefully. e-GMAT’s Master Comprehension course is a good resource to start with. 
	For all of Verbal, watch out for Harsha’s explanations on the forum- they rule! 
	e- GMAT Verbal is the closest to Verbal Official imo. 
b)	Quant:  
•	I didn’t do e-GMAT Quant much; the questions seemed to be decently more difficult (and longer) than Official Quant. But they’re great to build concepts, and to make sure you’re roasted to a level that you can crack the final test, with high accuracy (Q48+), and in the given time. 
c)	IR: 
•	A solid combination of e-GMAT’s Quant and Verbal finesse. 

	The OG bundle is actually a waste without e-GMAT. The questions are the same, but the answers are poor. Use e-GMAT's Strategic review process here. e- GMAT actually has several different types of quizzes they recommend you do at different stages of your prep. 
	Cherry on top- The simple and polished software further makes the content easy to absorb.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hey,
Since this platform Gmat Club has been super beneficial to me while preparing for GMAT, it is only justified to share my journey! I hope this adds value to your journey for GMAT prep. 
I am currently a final year student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering! I mention this fact as it was super hectic to manage uni and prepare for the exam at the same time. Nevertheless, it is indeed possible. During my first month of prep, I revised the basic concepts of Mathematics. It was not very hard for me as I had covered almost all the topics in high school. Also, engineering kept me in touch with mathematics! 
For reference, I covered the Veritas Course Books for mathematics. By the end of the month, I easily scored around 49-50 on Quant. Verbal on the other hand was dicey for me. I had covered Manhattan course books as well as veritas and those helped a lay a strong foundation with grammatical rules and made me familiar with the question types. Unfortunately, my verbal score had a wide range, from 37/38 on a good day to 32/23 on a bad one. My confidence skyrocketed on one day and dropped on the other. It was only then that I started looking for a good verbal course. Reading the reviews on GMAT Club Forum, I thought to go with E-GMAT as it had good reviews and a 2-month flexible period, which was right what I needed. I had planned to give my GMAT in the month of March-April, but it got dragged to May due to my fluctuating verbal score. 
Hands down, e-GMAT was what I needed to give me that push! 
To describe e-GMAT, it had a three-step learning process. 
1. Learning the concepts (Foundation Videos)  Pre-thinking is a major learning concept that helped me get through the Verbal section easily. 
2. Cementing ( Applying the concepts learned in the concept videos to real GMAT-like questions ). Honestly, it takes you from a beginner to an expert in that particular section. The solutions are well detailed and explained. So the major learning happens here. It was at this stage that I maintained an error log to understand and analyze the errors I was committing over and again.

3. Quizzes - A mix of questions from various blocks! 
For my nerdy friends, here are statistics of Verbal: Verbal Prep

1. Completed MC, SC, CR, and RC courses

2. Solved 536 verbal questions during cementing and test readiness phases
▪ You solved 100 questions in SC – 75 for cementing and 25 for
improvement of your accuracy SC to 70%
▪ You solved over 86 CR questions – over 50 for cementing 36 for
improvement of your accuracy in CR to 60%
▪ Solved 78 RC questions in the cementing phase and improvement
phase
▪ Solved over 70 questions in the test readiness phase
▪ Reattempted close to 126 questions across all the sub-sections

3. Demonstrated excellence in SC as indicated by 70% accuracy in hard
questions and proficiency in CR and RC as indicated by > 60% accuracy in
hard questions

Finally, there was the last mile program which is offered by e-Gmat, in which I was contacted by E-Gmat mentors for personal guidance on how to navigate and follow the course better tailored to my needs. 
Overall, it was a fantastic experience with the course.  I was confident of my score based on the last three mocks I gave on the platform. I ended up scoring a 41 on verbal, and 51 on quant! An overall score of 760! 

PS: If you are looking to improve your verbal, you need to check out the e-GMAT course! Depending on your time and need, you can choose either a 2-month course or a 6-month course!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=49#","0","0","","","","","",""

The e-gmat material came to my rescue with an amazingly well put together course for verbal, quant and IR. I started my preparations in December and had completed the main material by March. The online platform helped me stay on track continuously letting me know how many more hours I had to put in for each topic. But the best part was the PACE engine which is in built into the course and which helped me identify areas where I was good and could skip altogether. This reduced my overall prep time, leaving sufficient time to work on my weaker sections. The e-gmat material also has cementing quizzes which help solidify your concepts and has the ability to build custom quizzes. Each of these were a big help especially closer to my examination day when I needed to focus on improving my time management.

I took eGmat course based on a friend's recommendation and got quick results , especially for Quant.  The mock tests provide analysis of your answers at a topic level and give insights on where you are going wrong. I personally went through a lot of questions twice in order to gain mastery of the subject and it reflects in me scoring 100% on SC in GMAT( per my ESR). The quant questions in the course might feel tough but it will set you  up for a comfortable score in GMAT.

This was the first google search that most of us do and get a lot of content on the internet advising - ""what needs to be done"". However , finding the right schedule and the material to follow still remains the most difficult thing to do! 
As I started my journey last year in December , I thought just doing the Gmat official guide and giving as many mock tests as possible  will get me a decent score. 
Note: Absolutely no touch with books from the last 8 years
I had hard time concentrating and that increased my anxiety. After a month of preparation , I gave the test and got 460.

Hugely disappointed by my performance , I thought I have no where to go but that's when I saw one of the videos of e-gmat and that actually helped me understand one of the concepts. Immediately I took the e-gmat Online 360. 

What I liked the most - The whole course is self paced and the concepts are in the form where it actually helps a person to visualise. To cement what one learnt there are quizzes and it actually breaks down where should one focus. It helped me get a hold on my concepts, increase my speed and build the confidence on each module. I gave my Gmat on 10th May 2022 (with 6 weeks of preparation (solely e-gmat) and one mock test)
and received a score of 640 - V34,IR6,Q44. 180 points jump!!!!
With more practice and efforts , one can reach the desired score. My sole intention of writing this review - It actually helps. It helped me in 6 weeks to jump 180 points.

																			by score report","","Location","So I started my GMAT journey in September, straightway with the OGs without the help of any mentoring services available. Along my journey, I felt several hitches, and it ultimately reflected in my final score too. I ended up getting a score of 640 which was really heartbreaking. The PG course that I was looking forward to needed anything above 700. There are a lot of concepts and patterns that need to be cracked in order to hit the 700 mark. That’s where egmat came in and acted as the backbone of my journey. I delve deep into the verbal videos and noted the concepts thoroughly. In Quant, I got 49 or 50 in the mocks that I gave, so I didn’t practice it much. But it was a personal choice, I wouldn’t recommend that. Please go through all the videos on the egmat course. 
After the videos I jumped on the Scholaranium which felt like the exact replica of the GMAT exam. The period from September to November was really hectic for me. I was working as a developer, something that I scarcely liked. It was the initial phase of my job, so I had to attend training after work. In addition to this, I was looking for the PG course that suits my expectations. This may look simple, but it's a whole new world out there with a plethora of specialized courses. That took a considerable time. After all these, I would sit down and practice for my GMAT exam. I knew that I have grasped the concepts, but still I couldn’t ace my scholaranium quizzes. Two and a half months passed, I was on the verge of finishing my question pool and still no progress. 
At this point in time, it's easy to give up and just think that maybe it's not possible. But I calmed myself down took a couple of days off and soon realized that GMAT doesn’t only check your conceptual knowledge, it also checks your mindset. It's about how you approach questions and how you deal with them. After all my daily chores, the exhaustion wouldn’t allow me to be calm and solve questions with proper concentration. So firstly I quit my job, fixed my daily routine and after a short break I tried to give it another shot. I was out of scholaranium quizzes and most of the OG questions. I started looking for similar resources that could offer me the same level of English as GMAT, and what’s better than the American editorials. So I got The New York Times subscription and started reading 4-5 articles daily while keeping the concepts that I learned in the egmat course in my mind. 
Find the article that you find interesting and read it with full concentration. You’ll find everything there modifiers, subjunctive tense etc. 
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/science/burrowing-owls-transplants.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage§ion=Science.
After around 2 and a half weeks of dedicated reading, I attended my remaining questions and I could actually recognize the patters and concepts in the questions At this point in time, I felt a little confident and booked my exam date for 24th December. Ultimately, I managed to get a 700+ score and the feeling was just gratifying.
One last thing, do maintain an error log. It may seem frustrating, but you’ll see the difference.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","0","0","","","","","",""

eGMAT provides a very structured schedule based on the hours I can put for the preparation. Keeping up with the schedule helped me in structuring my preparation for Quant smoothly.
The Quant section of eGMAT is very thorough, structured and detailed. The experts do not want students to rely merely on the equations and formulae but rather on the logic behind those formulae. This approach ensured me that I could solve questions confidently even if I forget the formulae in the test hall. The diagnostic tests after every module also helped me to seal my learnings and use it on mock questions. The video answer solutions are beautifully created in a step-by-step method. In addition, the query forum for Quant section is lively and the experts take no time in replying back!
I was also assigned a mentor who kept an eye on my progress in quant section and provided suggestions to improve myself. The feedbacks assisted me further in boosting my confidence and making me test ready!
All in all, my experience with e-GMAT was amazing as I got a very good hold in Quants which in turn helped me to score a 700 with Q49 and finally securing a seat in INSEAD MBA D'23.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I went from 660 (based on official Gmat prep test) to 730 by using e-Gmat only. Took 3 months.

It has a LOT of material, both quant and verbal, and both theory and excercises. It also has a dedicated platform for testing which has official questions and questions similar to the official ones developed by e-Gmat. The platform has excellent statistics on your performance which are very helpful. It has as well 5 full Gmat mocks.

The downside is that there is just so much material and time estimates provided by e-Gmat are way too optimistic. Questions developed by e-Gmat are usually harder, more ambiguous and take more time to solve than official questions, consequently, you may believe that you are worse that your actual performance. The courses have material which may take hours to complete but relate to only a small subset of actual questions in the exam (so small in fact that you may never encounter such questions in any prep test or the official exam).

While e-Gmat theoretically breaks the learning curve in three stages to minimize the risk of you taking too much time reviewing stuff unnecessarily, the courses are actually designed for those who start from 0.

My word of caution if you choose e-Gmat is to be very strategic about how you decide to use the material. Always think about ways to skip parts of the study plan (while not affecting your learning). For example, you may skip pre-assessment quizzes, you may just skip to the summary on many topics, or the theory quizzes. Other topics may be skipped completely. You may also get worried because your score with e-Gmat questions is not as good as you may want... don't, rely on the score you get in the official questions. If you decide to follow the recommended e-Gmat strategy of first doing all verbal and then all quant, you may find that by the time you start doing the mocks, you have lost some skill in verbal questions.

All of this, of course, depends more on you and not so much on the side of e-Gmat. I think I could have gotten the same score in 2 months instead of 3 if I had been better at approaching the course material.

Overall, if you take into account this precautions, I do reccomend e-Gmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Here they used to teach from very basic, which made the concepts easy to grasp and apply. For each of the 3 sections of Verbal, they have a specified structured approach and methodologies to solve every question of that section irrespective of difficulty. This not only increases the probability of answering the question correct but in the exam environment every question is same for you and not wasting time or energy in differentiating the difficulty level and approach to solve such questions

 2. Cementing and test readiness tests
After completing modules of every sub-section, cementing quizzes are to be done which make sure that the person is comfortable in applying concepts thought in medium/difficult questions as well and moving to next section only after such surety

Throughout my journey, I got constant support for Strategy guidance and personal guidance/solution to all the hurdles which were coming in my way.

The Scholaranium 2.0 tool is very convenient for practice and allows for rapid improvement with its range of questions and explanations. The meaning based approach for SC questions in verbal is great but still feel the actual test is more inclined towards testing idiomatic structure. The mentorship programme too is a great part of Egmat as you are guided in a very focused manner towards the examination by experts personally. The best parts of the course are the comprehensive analysis it throws at you at each stage, the variety of topics and questions and some fairly accurate mocks. All in all after being exposed to few other popular Gmat preparation programmes I would personally reccomend the Egmat platform.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","0","0","","","","","",""

My GMAT journey began around September 2021. I initially purchased the OG and started solving questions. The 'Easy' difficulty questions were relatively straightforward, but I was not getting the desired accuracy and speed in the 700+ level difficulty questions, both in quant and verbal section.
I looked up some online courses and found that e-GMAT was the most recommended. So, I enrolled for the 4 month eGMAT online intensive course in October 2021. Scored a 710 on my first SigmaX mock. 
The course was very thorough. I was previously solving most of the verbal questions instinctively, but after going through the e-GMAT module, my question solving approach became methodological. The meaning based approach for solving SC questions was especially helpful. In Quant, solving multiple questions in Scholaranium helped as I was able to cut down my takt time and silly mistakes.
e-GMAT is a great course, especially for working professionals. I Iost around 2 months of prep time in November/December due to some emergency at work, so had to purchase a 1 month extension. But the whole experience was hassle-free. I did not feel the need to refer to any other material apart from the e-GMAT modules and the OGs.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","1","0","","","","","",""

eGMAT is known for their learning material, one of the reasons why I signed up with them. Their GMAT 2-month intensive course is very well crafted and has detailed solutions. They have a vast database of 800+ questions in each of the Verbal and Quant courses. I used to struggle a lot with timing and eGMAT's Test Readiness Quizzes really helped me mimic the sectional and full-length tests. 

eGMAT also offers personalized support under their Last Mile Program. This is something that isn't heavily publicized by them. eGMAT selects few students who show promise based on their Sigma X Mock scores and provides them with personalized support at no additional cost. I had the pleasure of having two mentors as a part of the program - Atreya and Rida. While Atreya helped me with the initial steps of my preparation, Rida supported me during the last leg. She offered detailed videos to my doubts, created hyper-specific study plans based on my needs, and was very accessible during the course of my preparation. She is also really fun to talk to and had a lot of experience to share since she also had appeared for the GMAT and so understood the complete process in and out. 

Overall, I would highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone who wishes to jump right into preparation and not waste any time searching for the 'right' resources.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Yes, you read it right. In this review, I’m going to provide a brief on how to achieve 700+ through a structured approach and how e-gmat helped in achieving the same. Being a decent student throughout my life, I imagined I’d sail through the Gmat test without much hindrance. So, I attempted the exam with only 2 weeks of prep, solving only OG questions. Alas, my initial Gmat attempt showed me the reality, wherein I was only able to score a 690, much lower than what I had expected. I spoke to a few of my friends and colleagues who had scored exceptionally well in Gmat and came to know about the e-gmat course. I tried the free trial and was impressed by the structured approach that the course followed. You will find below the strategy I had followed during my prep:

1.	Get your basics right – Many of us (including me) believe that the basics required for the GMAT are not important and straightaway dive into solving questions. While you might get a decent chunk of questions right during your prep phase, you might not get it right in the actual exam. And the reason here is that you are not selecting the correct answer choice for the right reason. This is where e-gmat’s step-by-step video courses help you in building the foundation. The videos provide you with the basics and make sure (through its cementing process)) that you learn those skills before moving to difficult questions.
2.	Understand your weakness – Inherently GMAT is an exam that covers a wide variety of topics and while it is a good idea to cover every topic thoroughly it might not be the most optimum way to go about it. Since each individual has a different background, everybody will have a different set of strengths and weaknesses. Hence, analyzing the weakness would help you in optimizing your study plan. This is where e-gmat’s Scholaranium 2.0 helps the most. This platform’s analytical view not only helps you in understanding your weaknesses but also helps track your improvements in these subsections.
3.	Train your mind – Gmat is all about training your mental muscles. With ~1.5 mins/question, Gmat doesn’t give you the bandwidth to do a detailed analysis during the actual exam. Hence, it is important to do your homework before the exam. And the way to do it is to internalize different techniques to solve different types of questions. E-gmat provides you with all the techniques that you will need, to solve high difficulty questions in a limited time. Initially, I had a dreadful time figuring out why my accuracy did not stabilize in the verbal section. The answer was, that I never focused much on techniques. Through e-gmat’s course, I came across techniques like the meaning-based approach in SC, pre-thinking in CR & reading strategies in RC. Once, I had internalized these strategies, I was able to improve my accuracy and stabilize it as well. E-gmat also helps you in internalizing the techniques through its cementing process and detailed explanation of each question.
4.	Make yourself test ready – Most of us consider test readiness by simply giving numerous mocks. While it might work for a few, it doesn’t work for everybody. Getting yourself test-ready also requires a step-by-step approach. E-gmat’s Scholaranium 2.0 and the SigmaX mock test aid you in this process. While Scholaranium 2.0 helps you in getting yourself test ready at a sectional level, SigmaX mocks help you in building stamina and make you test ready from an end-to-end exam perspective. Further, SigmaX mocks also give you detailed insights into where you are going wrong at a subsectional level, so that you can go back and strengthen those areas. There are a good 5-6 actual GMAT-like mocks, which you can use to track your progress towards your dream score. Additionally, these tests also help you in building the strategy for the d-day. In other words, you don’t need to answer every question correctly, so these mocks help you in strategizing which type of questions to guess, when to guess, etc.

Last but not the least, Gmat prep can be frustrating (and mentally draining) for some of us and that is where you need a little bit of push. Gmat offered me a dedicated mentorship in this regard. My GMAT mentor Rida Shafeek was extremely helpful in pushing me in the last phase of the journey (through personalized videos and hyper-specific plans) and gave me the direction I needed.

My learning from this journey – “GMAT is more a test of your ability to strategise than a test of your superior Mathematics or English knowledge.”","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=50#","2","0","","","","","",""

Although I had intended to seek help only in Verbal section, e-GMAT's Quant concept modules and practice sections were a major help as well. 
eGMAT's three step approach- understanding the question from the meaning perspective, finding possible errors based on the concerts learned in the tutorials and assessing all the wrong options- came in handy for my Verbal score improvement. 
I could not only understand the nuisances of typical grammar being asked in the GMAT exam, but also apply them in the stimulated mock tests. (You can see how I applied the parallelism of not only, but also right here. ;) ). I could improve my score in Verbal from a below average 26 to a good 41 with the help of e-GMAT.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Spoiler : Just take the subscription !!!

Background: 
My first dig at the GMAT exam was an e-gmat mock (sigma-X) where I scored a 600 (Q46, V26). 

I moved onto OG, concept books, etc. and could see myself enhancing my knowledge significantly in SC and CR. I saw the improvement in my GMATPrep mock attempts too, wherein I scored ranges between 700 and 740 consistently. 

Looking at the mock scores, I was certain that I was empowered with the skills needed to clear the 700-mark. I unfortunately couldn’t cross the barrier in the 1st attempt. Due to my higher mock scores in GMATPrep, I was certain that there was nothing wrong with my preparation methods and perhaps it was a one-off scenario. But, after analyzing the ESR of my 2nd failed attempt and noticing a below average performance across the whole of verbal section, I realized that there definitely were conceptual gaps which I’d needed to cover up. 

E-GMAT:
Based on recommendations of my friends, I quickly moved onto e-gmat. The first thing one could notice immediately is how comprehensive the course is. As suggested in the course, I started off with SC -> CR -> RC.

SC modules are definitely the beast in the course. They are elaborately explained using really simple terms such as verb-ing, verb-ed etc. instead of terms such as gerunds, transitive verbs, etc. For somebody who isn’t a grammarian, these usages are alone a massive time saver. Probably the biggest eye opener for me was focusing on the meaning of the sentence and making sure that the sentence made sense rather than just relying on grammar rules to solve the questions. Towards the end of my preparation, I could easily spot the correct answer choice within a couple of seconds and was hardly stuck between two answer choices, simply because of relying on the meaning-based approach. My simplest recommendation to everyone would be not to follow any form of shortcuts to solve SC questions. I have experimented such strategies in my attempts, and found failure for most parts. There is absolutely no point saving time when you can’t get the question right. 

The most critical aspect of CR was the art of pre-thinking. Going through the range of answers in the mind is exactly what saves one from selecting the incorrect answer choices. A tough but effective strategy, pre-thinking has been taught exhaustively throughout the CR course. I had reached a stage where I didn’t even need to go through all the options during my final attempt -  the moment the correct option came up, I was confident it was the right one! That’s the power of pre-thinking. I also tried out PowerScore CR Bible, although the contents are pretty much in similar lines as in e-gmat’s CR course.

RC course is great for someone trying it out for the 1st time. I had gone through a very similar process of understanding main theme of passage and watching out for the transition/key words (but, however, nevertheless, etc.) to solve the passages effectively during CAT prep. One aspect that I did notice across my attempts (GMAT exam and GMATprep mocks) was that the passages were seldom difficult to comprehend. It’s perhaps the exam pressure at times that might get to us, but one calm and well-paced reading is enough to nail the RC questions that follow the passage. Sufficient practice would enable you to easily identify what the “well-paced” definition might look like for you.

During my 1st GMAT attempt I had scored a Q49 in quants, a score that sounded great since it was just 2 points below the maximum (51). However, only when I looked at the percentile column next to the scorecard, did I realize that it was a 74th percentile, making me feel that I need to up my ante in quants too. I had relied on my CAT material for majority of the preparations for Quants, but used e-GMAT’s quant time and again to fine tune my skills in topics I wasn’t completely comfortable with such as number systems and modulus (algebra). The structure of the course was well laid out wherein I needed to just do the concepts I was not familiar with, and the algorithm did well to identify such areas and helped me speed up my quant prep significantly. 

Over time, I kept taking up sectional tests in verbal and quant repeatedly to figure out patterns in my mistakes and took actions to correct them.

The support provided through emails, general queries, etc. was great too. I was once asked to use the error-log for my verbal section and noticed that there were many aspects of analysis which I had missed out on. While I didn’t maintain an error log throughout my preparation, my analysis methodology changed and I could see myself doing more than simply going through the solutions of the questions. 

Scholoronium provided me a massive question bank and was more than sufficient in terms of quantity to help solve a variety of quality questions. The most impressive part of scholoronium was its detailed explanation. I had spent a significantly longer duration analyzing my attempts in scholoronium compared to my attempts on any other platform. 

I would definitely recommend e-gmat based on my experience.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=51#","2","0","","","October 06, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Acegmat603,  

Congratulations on your score of 760 and becoming a member of the top 1 percentile test takers! A 160-point improvement with a 16-point improvement in Verbal from V26 to V42 is in no ways a small feat to achieve.  

If I have to show someone an example of not giving up, it will have to be of yours. It is because of your hardwork and willingness to score good that you aced the exam in your 5th attempt over a span of 9 months. Hats off to you!  

I must commend you on your diligence showed during your preparation. You followed the 3 Stages of Learning in the prescribed manner.  

First Stage - You learned the modules diligently as it was indicated by your average concept quizzes scores and practice quizzes scores. 

Second Stage - You then mastered the concepts through Cementing stage in Scholaranium. 

Please refer to the image to see his diligence in the first two stages -

																			by score report","Points","Location","I began my GMAT journey back in July 2021. I was flooded with a huge amount of resources online, did whatever felt right to me and scored a disappointing 630. Fast forward to January 2022. I decided to give the GMAT another shot. I knew that I needed a structured approach this time. I already knew about E-GMAT as I had used some of their resources in my last attempt, and I decided to go for it!

This turned out to be the best decision! I was able to find all that I lacked in my previous attempt. I was confident about my Verbal, but my Quant needed a lot of work! So, I went through the course in detail. Thankfully, the Xpert architecture in the Quant course helped me save a lot of time. The meaning-based approach was very useful in Verbal. I could clearly make out a difference in the way I was solving the SC questions before and after the course. In CR, I found the pre-thinking approach especially useful. What helped me the most were the error logs and the cementing quizzes after every module. I found it frustrating at first to note down every mistake and my thinking behind it while filling the error logs, but I feel this was a real gamechanger. The cementing quizzes helped me build a solid foundation and boosted my confidence(Which is exactly what I needed especially in Quant)

Another thing that I found extremely useful was the Q&A forum. Personally, I did not find the need to ask many questions as the discussions were already available in the existing threads. But for all the questions I asked, I got a very quick response.

Coming to the SigmaX mocks, I did not find the need to write any other mocks. The SigmaX mocks were pretty on the spot. I scored a 720, 700 and 750 in the mocks which was pretty much consistent with what I scored on the actual test. I found the detailed analysis of the performance at the end of every mock to be very beneficial. I used this data to find out where I was wasting time and strategize for the D-day.

Finally, I would like to give a huge shoutout to my mentors DJ, Rida and the entire support team at E-GMAT. I couldn't have done this without them! I was taken in as a part of the last mile program and Rida helped every step of the way. She helped me create a specific plan and the insights she provided were very useful. The calls I had with her throughout helped me plan, strategize and most importantly identify my strengths and weaknesses. She also suggested some customized tests to me to overcome my timing and other issues.

This is more or less my journey to a 730! I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a structured approach to their preparation and achieving their target score!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=51#","0","0","","","","","",""
"April 12, 2022","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","Journey from 620(Q49 V27) to 730(Q50 V38)","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","I appeared for my first GMAT attempt on 23rd July, 2021 with sufficient enough preparation of about 3 months, but I could score only 620. Having been a bright student for most part of my life, I was not able to comprehend the fact that I scored only V27. I was a bit shocked and depressed because I knew this was not my best and I could do better. I took a break of about 2 months before entering into a full-fledged preparation mode. I researched about available options for online GMAT preparation courses and, after a thorough analysis and reading multiple reviews from different sources, I decided to go with e-GMAT.

Following were my reasons to go with e-GMAT and what makes them unique, especially for a non-native English speaker like me:

It’s a complete package – When I was narrowing down my options, it was a close call between TTP and e-GMAT. Why I preferred e-GMAT over TTP is because after the end of the course, e-GMAT has this amazing feature/tool called Scholaranium. It is a quizzing platform with tons of features. We can customise the quizzes as per our need at a granule level. For example, we can practice RC passages from a specific domain (such as history, economics, biosciences, etc), CR arguments of a particular type (such as bold face, flaw, fill in the blank, etc), SC questions from a particular concept (such as tenses, modifiers, parallelism, idioms, etc), and Quant questions from a particular domain (such as prime numbers, even-odd, absolute inequality, triangle, sets, etc). We can also customise quizzes to simulate the Quant and Verbal sections of GMAT and slowly work on our appetite to get accustomed to the full length GMAT (increasing accuracy while staying within optimum time limits).

Each question (be it from the concept file, application file, practice file or Scholaranium) has an explicitly elaborate explanation in the form of text or a short video. Even if we are not satisfied/convinced by the explanation, each question has its own “Ask an expert” section with an explicit thread of previously answered/unanswered doubts. Most of the queries get addressed by this stage, even if not, we can always post our doubt and can expect it addressed within 24-hours (mostly).

The course is structured in such a way that you can actually feel growing at an intellectual level with each passing module. You go through the concept files, practice some easy level questions, and slowly move on to the 700-750 level questions, and the transition is so seamless that you actually feel more and more confident with each completing section.

Another amazing feature that makes e-GMAT unique is their approach. Entire preparation plan is divided into three stages: first you learn all the concepts, then you practice those concepts under Cementing stage (medium to hard level questions of a particular section in a timed environment) and once you are done with both these stages for all the sections, you move to the third stage in which you practice questions from multiple sections, slowly working towards test readiness.

Also, they offer 5 mocks (including 1 free mock), which are VERY similar to the actual GMAT exam. I used only 3 of those paid ones and my score were 750, 710 and 740. The feedback that you get from xPERT engine on these mocks is unmatchable. It shows timing vs accuracy matrix at not only sectional but also sub-sectional level. You can analyse SOO much from this data to work on your weak areas as per your requirement/need. In addition to that, whenever in doubt, you can of course reach out to the e-GMAT team anytime and they help you with each and every doubt within a couple of hours.

The one-on-one support that you get from the e-GMAT team regarding your doubts, next step, or feedback on your mock is just unparalleled. It's as good as having a private tutor. I owe a major part of my success (can call 730 a “success” :P) to Ms. Rida Shafeek and Mr. Dhananjay Lowe. I was associated with Mr. DJ during the initial phase and he helped me with each and every doubt, not necessarily related to the concepts. During the final few days, Ms. Rida was the one who helped me stay on track and learn from my mistakes. She used to analyse each of my mocks, make custom, structured, to the point and hyper specific data driven Loom videos, help me maintain my error logs, point out the topics that I needed to revisit, and comment on my general test taking strategy (such as timings in each block), my weak areas, and my strengths. She also helped me understand when I should just let go of a particular question in order to save time for the future ones. I would say, she was the saviour for me during those last 10-15 days that are the most crucial ones in anyone’s test prep journey.

I tried to extract as much as I could from the feedbacks that I received from Ms. Rida and finally went ahead and attempted the GMAT on 09th April, 2022. The moment I saw screen flashing 730 (Q50 V38), I knew it was all worth it.

One more thing that I would like to explicitly mention is that my subscription to their portal ended just 2 days before my actual exam and upon request they extended it for 3 days without any extra charge. This act (in addition to the several reasons mentioned above) shows that although they are in this for business (obviously), e-GMAT stands for something much more than just a means to make money.

In conclusion, if you chose to make e-GMAT part of your journey, rest assured that “they will be there for you” till the very Last Mile.

I thank Rajat, Payal, Rida, Dhananjay (DJ) and the entire e-GMAT team for making it all worthwhile.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=51#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My initial attempt without prep was 610(Q50, V23). I'm pretty sure V23 was a fluke. After receiving a suggestion to signup for the E-GMAT course from a family friend(740), I decided to signup for the E-GMAT course. The initial 3 months of prep were irregular. To be honest, I misused my course. I simply went through video lectures without paying attention. I practiced a lot of questions without following any of the E-GMAT's methodologies and I ended up with 660 (Q49, V31). Note: At this point in time I took just one mock test.  Frustrated with my performance I reached out to the E-GMAT team to help me understand what is wrong with my performance. I think this is the best decision of my life. 

The E-GMAT team placed me under the LMP program (Where you would be assigned to a mentor to track your performance). My first mentor was Atreya, He immediately figured out that my way of preparation was bad and asked me to redo my course. There were a lot of features which I left unexplored for example. 1) Sigma X mock test (Accuracy of these mocks is beyond my imagination. my score in mocks is ±10 points the score on the official GMAT). 2) Scholarinum (Targeted practice on your weakness). 3) The P.A.C.E (Based on your weakness the course automatically suggests which lectures you should be focussing on. Thereby saving you a lot of time). After spending 2 months (irregularly) I was impatient so I took one more official test now I ended with 690 (Q50, V 32). 

After this, my mentor had to change for some reason. I was assigned to Rida Shafeek. She quickly assessed my profile and made me focus on my weak areas (SC and CR). I was asked to take mini mocks and I would an immediate review of the test which I took. Rida made me focus primarily on methodologies to solve problems rather than solving a ton of problems.  She prepared a plan for me to take mocks in right away. Not just preparation, Rida constantly strived to help me build the right mindset for my final D-day. And the result is 730 (Q51, V37). It was Rida from the E-GMAT team who made this possible for me.

Summing up everything, E-GMAT has the right course material and the right mentors to help you achieve your target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=51#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey by going through the Official Guide and rummaging through GMAT content on the Internet. I watched many videos online and read countless articles and blog posts to learn more about the exam structure, what resources are necessary and how to approach the exam. This primary research informed me that going to a local GMAT prep provider or trying to do this on my own probably would not be good. So, I searched for online GMAT prep providers who could help me through the process of tackling the GMAT and came across a webinar hosted by Rajat from E-GMAT on Critical Reasoning. It was the first time I was introduced to the idea of ''pre-thinking''. I went through some of the SC videos that one can access for free - I was hooked. I then proceeded to buy the entire E-GMAT course. 

I first sat for a Sigma X mock (E-GMAT's own set of mock exams) to assess where I stand and what areas I need to improve. I scored a 580 (Q41, V29) and contacted the E-GMAT strategy team to provide me with a plan moving forward. The E-GMAT course also has a neat feature that allows you to personalize your study based on your target score, hours you can put in each weekday/weekend, and when you wish to sit for the exam. I sat down with Dhruv over a Zoom call to discuss my Sigma X mock, and after the call received an email with clear guidelines on what to do next in my preparation. The Master Comprehension course provided a solid introduction to the Verbal section. At the same time, the cementing quizzes that I took after completing SC, CR, and RC helped me identify problem areas. 

The modules that helped me the most were the Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning modules and Quant 2.0. The ''meaning-based approach'' helped me understand SC questions more clearly and look beyond grammatical errors - this helped me solve 700-level questions more confidently. I initially struggled to understand the nuances in CR questions. However, as I understood ""Pre-thinking'' and tried to implement it in questions, I got a good grasp on more challenging CR questions. 

Quant 2.0 covers every Quant topic and sub-section with great depth. The focus is on learning the process skills to help you solve GMAT questions. A diagnostic quiz at the start of each module assesses your initial ability. In addition, every part of the E-GMAT learning module (both Quant and Verbal) is now equipped with P.A.C.E (Personalized, Adaptive, Course Engine) that allows you to skip portions of each module based on your score in the diagnostic quiz. This feature can save students time that they can use elsewhere. 

Scholaranium 2.0 is where you go from learning to implementation. It is a robust platform that provides you with hundreds of questions in each section. In addition, you get access to a whole range of data analytics on Scholaranium 2.0 - you can pinpoint weak areas, time taken on questions, and what level (easy/medium/hard) questions you are struggling on. You can also take customized quizzes based on your preferences. The question bank in Scholaranium has more than enough questions to provide you with solid preparation. I found the Quant Scholaranium questions more challenging than OG questions or the actual exam, which helps you prepare better when you sit for the GMAT. In addition, the detailed explanations provided after each question and the query threads where students can clear any doubts help you get a clear understanding. 

While the GMATPrep mocks are the closest thing to the actual exam in terms of algorithm and difficulty level, they do not provide detailed feedback on your mock performance. What is the point of sitting for mocks if you cannot understand where you are lacking, right? This is where Sigma-X mocks help you with a complete debrief of your performance. The time taken on each question, performance on each sub-section, and detailed explanations are provided for each question. As you get closer to the actual exam, the scores on your Sigma-X mock will reflect your actual score. My scores on the Sigma-X mocks were within 20 points of my final score. 

Finally, I would like to talk about how I went from scoring around 700 on my 2nd/3rd Sigma-X mocks to scoring 740 on the actual exam. After I scored a 710 on my 3rd Sigma-X mock, I reached out to the E-GMAT strategy team as I did not know what else I could possibly do to improve. I also had two and a half weeks left before my exam. The Strategy team informed me about the Last Mile Pledge program at E-GMAT. The Last Mile Pledge initiative provides students with a mentor who guides them through the final stages of preparation and a holistic plan leading up to the exam. I got in touch with Rida, who sat down on a call with me and patiently listened to all my concerns. She then shared a hyper-specific plan with personalized videos that catered to my weak points. She pointed out that I did not take enough cementing quizzes or quizzes that mimicked each section of the exam (31 Verbal/36 quant question quizzes). I took her feedback on board and stayed in touch over the next two weeks as she continued to share more plans with me to improve in problem areas. 

Rida's best piece of advice was not to take too many mock exams. Many people on online forums suggest taking as many mocks as possible. However, I believe it is better to take fewer mocks and focus on the problems you are making rather than keep taking one after the other - something that I learned from Rida. I took just six mocks leading up to the exam, and I felt it was adequate. I would like to thank Rida for taking the time to listen to my endless questions, prepare a plan based on my performance in Scholaranium and Sigma-X mocks, and provide me with a clear path to getting a good score. 

If you are reading this review and have made it this far, I would like to thank you for taking the time. If you are preparing for the GMAT, E-GMAT is the best support you can get out there. However, please do your own research before deciding since you will be investing a lot of time, money, and effort once you select a prep provider. Having said that, you cannot go wrong with E-GMAT. 

The E-GMAT course and analytics are continuously improved, and more modules are added every few months. For example, the P.A.C.E feature was not there when I started the course but was later introduced. Overall, E-GMAT is one of the best GMAT prep providers, and my 160 point score improvement is a testament to their credentials!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","In my opinion, E-gmat is the best possible tool you need to tackle GMAT and reach your target score. Initially, when I decided to take GMAT, I took a ""cold test"" in which I got 550.  I was worried about how to best tackle the massive amount of information that I needed to look at (in my case: basically everything), while working very long hours (~12 hs a day). It was a colleague of mine that recommended E-GMAT, as the best way to study focused on the areas that you need to improve and also structure your test taking methodology. 

My weakest area was Verbal and E-GMAT taught me how to tackle Verbal questions in a structured manner and save time. The course is focused on teaching techniques that, once you incorporate, help you solve questions faster and efficiently. For me, that was mostly ""pre-thinking"" (trying to guess a few ideas that would answer the question, so that you don't select deceiving choices) and Reading Comprehension reading strategies. Also, what I loved is that most questions have a detailed video explanations which cover why correct choice is correct, but also why incorrect choices are incorrect (including descriptions of ""common traps""). The quality of these explanations and level of insights were really helpful. Actually, they helped me identify some patterns that appear on GMAT questions frequently, something that increased my confidence on exam day.

I would also recommend doing the Quant course, even if you come from technical background. The quant course has a feature that assesses your previous knowledge through diagnostic quizes and then adapts the course so that you make best use of your time. For example, you might know some circle and triangles concepts very well, while you may need to work on your 3D solids concepts. Or you may even know all the geometry concepts perfectly, but need to practice GMAT level excercises. The course will be tailored to you to optimize the time invested.  Additionally, I personally found Scholaranium excercises even harder than real GMAT, which I found very useful to feel well prepared!

Apart from the course, you get access to Scholaranium tool. Here, you can tailor quizes to your specific needs, in terms of types of questions, difficulty and timing. Personally, I found this tool particularly helpful to train myself to do exercises in shorter time! Also, I used it a lot to go back to ""incorrect questions"" and make sure I had incorporated all learnings from them. 

In Scholaranium, you also get access to 5 Sigma X mocks. These exams replicate GMAT exam conditions, in terms of questions, difficulty, and even breaks between sections. I found the exams to be in a very similar difficulty level than real GMAT exam on Verbal, and even slightly more difficult in Quant. Results are actually very accurate, and after each exam you get a very detailed and insightful summary of your strenghts and weaknesses in terms of accuracy and also time. This is crucial so that you focus your preparation on where you need to improve the most. 

If you also add the help from a tutor/coach that guides you and helps you understand root causes of your weaknesses across sections, you have got an unbeatable strategy! In my case, that person was DJ and I couldn't be more grateful for his help. First, he's very approachable and knowledgable about GMAT. He made a tailored study plan based on my mocks, which was key for my success. Secondly, he makes sure to be available for you when you need it the most: he responded some emails on weekends, which is something I didn't expect at all. In fact, I know from friends that instructor availability is a major issue when using other GMAT tools/options. Last but not least, he helped me gain confidence I needed to actually take the exam. When I first contacted him, I had been studying on and off (mostly off) for many months, and in around 3-4 weeks, we did the prep I needed to take the exam and get to my target score. What helped me get the confidence? DJ's personalized plan focused the preparation on my weak areas. DJ: thank you very much for your help! I couldn't have done it without you.

Overall, if you want to make the most out of your time, I would definitely recommend using E-gmat tool from day 1!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

I Enrolled with EGMAT in October 2021 . I used their platform for 5 months and this is my review.

I got a 660 in my first attempt and I enrolled with EGMAT and I found their portal really good for verbal specially Sentence Correction. For quant its above average.  EGMAT helped me reach a  level of 710 .
Their analytics and user interface are amazing. SCHOLARANIUM is what I believe is the Highlight of the course, its just too good.
Quality of their mocks is again above average with great analytics provided for review. One of their feature called PACE is really helpful not at all a gimmick.
So personally I can recommend EGMAT to anyone looking for a Good GMAT prep Self Paced Course.
The only problem I faced with EGMAT was because of some reasons I could not follow their entire process and I was not really satisfied with my 700-710 level performance and wanted to improve more and decided to mail them for support but didn't receive any reply from them.
Yes I did falter a bit but I expected more.

Overall the EGMAT prep course if you follow the entire process is really good and I recommend EGMAT to everyone.
And Still hoping I will soon get to that 750+ score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","0","0","","","April 03, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","@Shivamrr19 – thank you for your very honest and balanced review.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey back in 2019. As it happens with most of the test-takers, I was flooded with tonnes of test-prep materials. I struggled to filter them out and fell into the trap of solving more and more questions to gain a higher score. Of course, I ended up with a disappointing score of 660. Fast forward to 2020, I re-started by GMAT prep during the lockdown. This time, I was sure that I needed a focused approach. 

After speaking to a few people, I was convinced that there is nothing better than E-GMAT, especially for Verbal. Within no time, I enrolled for the course and E-GMAT was kind enough to enroll me for their pilot batch of the mentorship cohort. Here are things that stood out for me:

1. Course Content - The meaning-based approach in SC and the pre-thinking analysis in CR were game-changers. I felt much more confident, and verbal quickly became my strength from weakness. I consistently scored 40+. After having studied quant from 3 sources, I can again say that E-GMAT's quant really helped me identify gaps and feel more confident about my prep.

2. The different quizzes available - concept, application, cementing, and test-readiness. E-GMAT's emphasis on acing each of these sequentially really helped identify and bridge gaps. It helps pinpoint exact gaps and allows you to tailor your learning accordingly. 

3. The focus on process skills - One thing that puzzled me was the fact that even though I knew the concepts, I would still struggle to get the answers right. The focus on the process skills becomes really critical here. 

4. E-GMAT forum - the doubts forum is a gold mine. Even though the explanations are quite detailed, the question from fellow learners and the responses from E-GMAT mentors is a great way to clarify the smallest of the doubts. The response time to doubts posted is quick as well. 

5. Analytics - Again, the benefit of this cannot be underestimated. Honest tip - please do not even think about sharing your subscriptions. While it is unethical, you will be the biggest loser as you end up losing the benefits of the detailed analytics available on the platform. Analytics is a single source of truth. A lot of times, I felt confident on certain topics, but the analytics gave me a different picture altogether and I realized that I was actually making mistakes in topics I  felt comfortable about. 

6. Sigma X - Test Readiness and time management is a big part of the prep. Sigma X does really well here. Most of the other mocks available do not provide detailed analytics. Sigma X gives detailed insights into your time management skills and ability across different levels of difficulty. 

7. Lastly and most importantly - a huge shoutout to my mentors - Ashutosh and Rida. Both of them have been super hands-on and helped me with curated study plans. They brought a great deal of structure to the madness. The regular check-ins and targets helped me stay focused throughout the prep. I owe a lot to them. The last mile programme launched by E-GMAT is a great addition and I highly encourage fellow test-takers to take advantage of that. 

To sum up, after having gone through materials from 2-3 test prep platforms, I can confidently say that E-GMAT is the best out there. They are consistently improving and I am sure they will come up with more and more new features to make learning simplified!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","0","0","","","","","",""

Then in January again started the preparation and so on...
the material/conetnt on egmat specially the verbal part is top notch...

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi There!

Are you not able to break 700? Are you consistently scoring 680-690? Are you not able to improve your verbal score? If the answer to any of the questions is Yes, this review is for you. 

My short story of 2 attempts. 
I gave my first attempt in October 2021 and scored a 640(Q48, V30). Bummer right? [ I would like to mention that I believed I was at a 690 level but who cares what I think? The screen flashed a 640 and that was it. I was devastated) 
I gave my second attempt after 4 months in February 2022 and scored a 720 (Q51, V35)

So, what changed? In this 4 months gap, I bought the online e-GMAT Verbal and Quant course. After going through the course, I reached out to the team about my problems and the e-Gmat team assigned me with an expert Dhananjay Lowe for 1-1 personalised coaching (free of cost) as part of their LMP ( Last Mile Program) . This was the best decision I took in 2 years of my study drills. DJ (Dhananjay) has provided most of the feedback over email and there was one call at the start of the coaching and one before my exam. The coaching he provided was very realistic with achievable goals. That is one of the things that I like about eGmat. It is realistic.  

Before buying e-Gmat course: 

Just as an aspiring MBA applicant, I was excited to give GMAT. I started with Official Guide (1st mistake). I bought GMAC mocks ( GMAC provides 2 free mocks and 4 paid mocks). After attempting the first free GMAC mock test ( I think I scored in 500s. It got reset as the GMAC changed the portal recently resetting everything), I started my prep. My study drill was as below- 

- I was confident in Quant and was scoring 47-48 and sometimes 49. So, I would not solve many quant questions in my practice. I would just solve 20 in 20 minutes as a break from Verbal. 
- I exhausted my Official Guide hard copy books (that I bought in 2019 but I started my prep in 2021) and went to gmatprep and started solving questions in a random manner by selecting difficulty level to 700+ and source as Official Guide. I always timed myself. I did this for about as long as I can remember ( 6 months I think).
- So far, I had not made any notes. I had a fair idea of what a GMAT exam looks like and I was at a 650 level which was an improvement from the score I started with. (500s) 

My two cents about using OG- Do not start with Official Guide. You lose the fresh perspective with which you can approach each question. Be smart about using the OG. Go through the GMAT Syllabus. Study all the topics and start solving OG when you have a fair idea about all the topics and you think you have the expertise to solve them. 

I finally bought GMAC Mocks and gave them all in 1 week before my first attempt(2nd mistake), scoring 690 in all of them and 700 in one.I SCORED a 640(Q48 and V30) in my final exam. So what really went wrong? 

After buying e-Gmat course:

Below is a summary of what went wrong with my first attempt and the solutions to each of them that eGmat provided. 
1. Lack of a study plan was one problem in my prep which led me to not master any topic. I would always assume I am bad at Reading Comprehension which was actually not the case as pointed out by Dhananjay in our first 1-1 call where he quickly analysed the free eSigma Mock ( mocks by eGmat) I had given. 
	- Egmat created a study plan for me on the first day I bought the course. They will guide you how to create one as per your current level. I cannot emphasise more on the effectiveness of the 	study material they provide. They have recorded videos for every topic in a guided manner. You just have to buy the course and the rest is taken care of. There wasn’t one day I wasn’t excited 	to explore what’s in this video and I learnt from each and every video. There are different modules - Master comprehension, Reading comprehension, Sentence correction and Critical  			Reasoning. The quality of the material is top notch. I went through all the modules. Dhananjay made sure I do not skip even one video which I very much tried to. :P
2. Not analysing the mocks properly. Exhausting 4 mocks (actually 5) in one week was the second big mistake. Ideally, you need 3 days for 1 mock. First day - you give the mock,  second day - analyse it and then third day - work on the problem areas. ( maybe take more days) It is very hard to analyse mocks by yourself if you do not have a detailed analysis of your mock available. 
 -eGmat has some serious and one of the best mock analytics going on at the backend. The in depth analysis of each mock is amazing. It tells you about your problematic areas. There are videos available on the dashboard of how to use this tool which I would strongly suggest you watch in the very beginning. I did it way later in the process. You should use the material and the tools smartly to make the most out of the course. I was still not able to make the most out of the analytics until Dhananjay made a personalised video of one of my attempted mock “How to analyse mocks?”
3. Not creating an error log. If you do not follow a plan, it is highly likely that you will not make an error log for sure. Now, what is an error log? It is simply a list of all the questions you did wrong. To make sure you never make the same mistake again, eGmat has a very smart tactic of creating an error log. This was one of the first exercises Dhananjay asked me to do. He pointed out errors in my error log ( Can you imagine?). Now, what are errors in an error log? It is very important to understand why you marked what you marked and why you thought the right answer was wrong. Egmat has video solutions to every question which help you analyse where did you go wrong. ( almost all the questions with just a few exceptions for which detailed explanation is provided. )
4. Quant experts- I thought 48 is great. Until I came across a concept called cementing (an eGmat jargon). During my 1-1 coaching, I was asked to ‘Cement’ Quant. I did not know what is that until I cemented quant and scored a Q51 in my final exam. Basically, it is a drill of giving a set of medium and hard level quizzes till you achieve a desired accuracy. (The standards defined by eGmat which are very much achievable).  Scholaranium is a tool created by eGmat for Quizzes and Mocks. It is an amazing tool with thousands of quality questions. you can create custom quizzes by defining difficulty level of the questions. Make Scholaranium your best friend. Fellows, if you are good at quant, I would suggest why not be even better at it? Keep hustling. 
5. Confidence - You need to trust yourself. Sometimes, when you are so close to your target score, doubting your choices (not life choices) can really hurt your score. Once you know you are ready and you are achieving your target score in the mocks, book a date and give the GMAT within 2 weeks. 

After 4 months of effort and support from eGmat team, I finally scored 720. I would like to thank DJ for his constant support. Lastly, the Last Mile Programme ( through which I received the 1-1 coaching) was a huge success for me. 

To summarise, if you are new to GMAT, approach it the right way. If you are already preparing, go about it in a guided manner if you are not doing that currently. After a while, the drill is simple - give a mock, analyse and practice. 

Apart from eGmat course, below are some of the things I did in the span of 2 years of my on-off GMAT prep. I actually prepped in full swing from June-2021 to Feb-2022. 
- I watched GMAT Ninja’s SC videos on YouTube. There is a set of 6-7 videos and they are really good. 
- I had read 0 books before Jan 2020. I read around 12 books in 2020 and 2021. This improved my comprehension in reading.
- I skimmed through word power made easy but it is not really required. If you have time, give it a go. Even if it helps you solve a couple of questions that you might have marked wrong due to vocabulary issues, it’s worth it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","0","0","","","","","",""

Initially, I began my prep by using free sources such as gmatclub.com but soon realized that for Verbal, proper direction and guidance is necessary. This is where I took the focused course by e-gmat and it turned out to be a really good decision. The meaning based approach for SC, pre-thinking for CR and strategies for RC are the best ways to master the art of GMAT Verbal. Towards the end of the preparation, I wanted to gauge whether my preparation was up to the mark and I reached out to the team. I was connected with Dhananjay and he strategized my prep making me take stress quizzes which really helped me learn my areas of weakness. Finally, I scored 740 on the actual day and I can't be more grateful to e-gmat and DJ.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I am a full time working professional. I took the e-GMAT course after my first GMAT attempt in which I scored a 720 (Q51, V35). Though it is a fairly decent score, I felt that I could do better if I worked a little bit more upon my verbal section. 
Having exhausted all the resources out there, I wasn't sure how to exactly go about it. I had seen some e-GMAT ads earlier and somehow they always resonated with me, probably because they were focussing on mastering the concepts instead of teaching so called ""shortcuts"". So I just sent out an email to their support team asking for some suggestions to improve upon my verbal area. They precisely replied with a strategy to identify my weak areas and work upon them. I was really impressed and signed up for the 2 month course!
I already knew that SC and RC were my weak areas. I still took a Sigma-X mock which solidified this understanding. I had a lot of conceptual gaps in SC, which I started understanding after I went through the SC concept files. Earlier, I used to go with my gut feeling when down to two options which led to a lot of mistakes but after going through the concepts, I was able to bridge those gaps in my understanding and answer with much more confidence. After completing the SC concept files, I did some cementing quizzes and I could see the improvement in my accuracy. 
Now coming to RC, my weakness was the amount of time I took to completely understand the passage. I could read the passage pretty quickly but to understand it properly took 2-3 iterations. This increased the amount of time it took to attempt RC section. Because of this, I had less time for CR (which was my strength) and other questions towards the end of exam. I had to almost always guess last 4-5 questions because of this lack of time. When I went through the RC concept files, I was able to learn the key reading strategies. The most important one that worked for me was pre-thinking what would come next in the passage. This helped me read actively and stay immersed in the passage. I could see the results in the cementing quizzes I did after completing the concept files.
After completing these two sections, I practiced Verbal custom quizzes on Scholaranium 2.0. I simulated the exact testing environment and attempted same number of questions as the GMAT verbal section in every quiz. 
For each question, there is a thorough explanation on the forum. Apart from that there is a Q&A section which allows asking any doubts to SMEs. I personally did not feel the need to ask any doubts because the existing threads (discussions other people had with the experts earlier) were enough to solve them.
Also, the review list that is provided after doing the quizzes helped me a ton! Earlier, I used to review just the incorrect questions. But the AI driven review list provides the set of all questions that need to be reviewed - the incorrect ones, the ones in which you spent a lot of time and the ones in which you spent very little time (got them correct due to luck factor). I really loved this feature because I was able to bridge the conceptual gaps I had even in the questions I got correct.
After I had enough confidence on my improvement, i started taking Sigma-X mocks and was really happy to see the improvement. My mock scores were: 770, 740, 740, 750 with a consistent 40+ verbal score. A great kudos to the e-GMAT team for designing mocks which are a very close simulation of the actual exam in terms of the level of questions, scoring and pretty much every thing! The mocks also have section level analysis which I found very helpful. After taking the mock, apart from the overall score, a section level score is also provided (like separate scores for SC, CR and RC in verbal). It helped me to see the scope of improvement and work upon my weaker areas.
Summing up, I would highly recommend taking up the e-GMAT course to minimise your prep time and achieve your target score! I really wish I had taken it earlier at the time of my first attempt.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","First i'll start with my background, I am a marine engineer. My GMAT journey began in august 2020. The first ever e gmat mock i took was in August 2020. I scored 400 on the mock. I did not know what to make of that score. So i started preparing all by myself.  

I Completed the OG guide, verbal review and quant review in a couple of months. I gave all the 6 official mocks, 6 Manhattan mocks, 6 veritas prep mocks. My approach to the exam was entirely incorrect.  I tried to improve by giving more and more mocks.   Then i gave the actual test and got a 600 first and a 610 the next time. That is what you should expect if you do not follow the right approach or study sub standard material. 

I realized my mistake. I took a six month break, went on the ship, did not study there. I came back in August 2021. I decided to do things differently this time around.  I signed up for the eGMAT course. At the beginning you are asked to take a diagnostic test to see where you stand.  I got a 620, but since i had given the same mock a year ago the score was inflated as i remembered a few questions in the verbal section. 

The e-gmat platform allows you to prepare a study plan according to the number of hours you can put in daily. this is something that you must definitely follow or else amend it according to the number of hours you can put in. The platform first teaches you all the concepts and at each step of the way there are quizzes to guide you in the right direction. If you have any questions then you can write to the e gmat team and they get back to you within a day mostly. It's very important to clarify doubts on the platform in order to cement your understanding of each topic. once you complete the leaning bit, you must cement your concepts on the scholaranium platform. The questions that you come across on Scholaranium are far superior to the questions you will come across on any other platform. Once you solve questions on this platform it is highly likely that you'll find questions on the actual exam relatively easy. It is imperative that you solve the verbal and quant questions using the approaches taught in the curriculum as it is what will help you on the test day.  When you are done with the cementing process, you start with test readiness. On clearing the test readiness stage you move on and give sigma mocks. the Sigma mocks are the best mocks out there.  I got a 700 on my 5th sigma mock and that is the same score that i received on the day of the exam. The e gmat team is very helpful at every step of the way.  They always guide you in the right direction and correct you wherever you are going wrong. 

Right before the exam DJ, a mentor at e-GMAT helped me identify my weaknesses and shared a focused plan (LMA) with me. It covered all the topics that I must work on to  improve weak areas. It was very helpful. 
The team members are very supportive, and granted me an extension basis my exam date. 
I would also like to give a big shout out to DJ and Atreya who  stood by my side at times when even i didn't believe that i had the potential.

I highly recommend that students must  not waste time by following an incorrect approach or by solving questions that you'll never see on the GMAT. once you sign up for the eGMAT course, be rest assured that you're on the right path and that you will achieve your target score and get into your target school.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=52#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Specially with their AI based course for Quants which helps you skip parts you are strong at and only focus on the weaker sections, really helped me do focus studies. 

The thing that added most value to me where their cementing and custom quizzes which are a carefully curated set of questions from the huge amount of resources available which test our your ability and further guide you on how you can improve.

The granular structure of the course, detailed analysis of time and type of questions, really helped in gaining confidence that I could score at-least a 700.

																			by score report","Points","Location","When i made my mind on taking GMAT test in early 2021, i started looking around for ways to study online. I read reviews of online programs on gmatclub, and what people said about e-GMAT's course content and approach struck a cord with me. 

From my first encounter with types of skills and questions tested in GMAT, i understood well enough that i will be needing a tailored and 1 to 1 course that comes with a comprehensive plan and guide. There was no hesitation about choosing e-GMAT.

After i signed up and started my prep on e-GMAT's platform, i found it exceeding my expectations. The plan specifically tailored for my needs and weaknesses helped me navigate the course content and stay focused on study sessions. 

For a student who is steeped in jumping to calculations right away without analyzing the problem at hand first, Payal's emphasis on learning the core process skills and not the sheer number of questions solved, have changed my entire outlook for taking a test such as GMAT. As analyzing, understanding and concluding whilst carrying out the solution was my modus operandi until now, deploying process skills first was an eye opener and habit changer. It was transformational.

I have previously studied and prepared for others tests. However, i have never encountered a course content that is broken down into easy-to-digest portions. Every practice question was followed by a detailed explanation and every explanation was demonstrating the actual ""process skills"" involved. Since i finished my bachelor's degree, my mind was a bit rusty about math, yet e-GMAT' step by step courses helped revive those forgotten concepts. (with  the corresponding logic in real practice). 

After any subject completion, there is a section (Scholaranium) that helps the learner cement and track his/her understanding and ability. It is not just solving question after question. I got to know the areas i was faltering with the help of data and statistics. (These very data and stats are indicating that i need to retake the test).

All these study sessions and preparation were taking place during the pandemic waves and quarantines. Yet i managed to brush up basic concepts and test taking skills without any added course related stress. All thanks to the support and good effort by e-GMAT team.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=53#","1","0","","","March 08, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear MunkhbatBat,

"March 01, 2022","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","Best use of Technology and Data to Increase GMAT Ability!","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","Around 4-5 months back when I was considering to take the test, I approached quite a few people for their opinion on the test, and thus, I started researching about the different sections in GMAT, and what would the ""Syllabus"" and way of preparation for this test be. I talked to a few friends who had recently scored an amazing 730 or 760 with just a few months of preparation. So I had an Opinion that GMAT is a really easy test and as per their suggestions if I do the OG and some GMAT Club Questions I will be all set for a 700+ score in 2 months. 

I would laugh hard at that thought even now. Not that it is unachievable, but that was definitely not the case with me. But there are no regrets except one, that I did not sign up for e-GMAT earlier than I did. I wasted around 2 months just solving questions and learning from singular topics in an unstructured way. 

I’m enlisting a few interesting things from the e-GMAT pedagogy, which helped me increase my score from 540 in first mock to 710 in the actual exam:

1) Sigma X mocks helped me begin my learning journey by telling me the exact areas I should focus upon. 

It provides you with tons of data and analytics, I guess even more than the official GMAT ESR which helps you analyse your ability and behaviour.

2) Direct guidance on mail and pre-recorded videos help you with a custom path. With every student starting from a different ability level, this becomes really important. For me this was the only reason I wasted the first 2 months, as I took guidance from people who had a higher ability or those who had prepared for CAT or similar exams. 

3) Analytics in Verbal and Quant Scholaranium.
This is a pure blessing, as with every quiz you take, you can customize the type of questions (especially difficulty level - imp to judge current ability)  and view your weak and strong areas in a really bifurcated manner. 

And the guidance on mail which you receive from experts makes it truly BETTER THAN A PRIVATE TUTOR. Because these experts use such intensive data to analyse behaviour and use their experience to provide the exact way ahead. This was especially useful for a confused person like me. 

4) Mixed way of visual learning. 
Their interactive interface is the best I have ever seen. I tried quite a few free trials of others and the e-GMAT platform was the most engaging amongst all. 

I needed this as I am a visual learner and engaging in non-GMAT style quizzes while learning made a major difference for me. 

5) Individual attention. 
While signing up, I was quite apprehensive of how will I be able to solve my personal doubts on an online platform. This was my first experience with online learning and I am way too careful in paying for online courses. But the support I got from e-GMAT was really helpful. 

We have to mail our doubts to the experts which are then replied to within a day. They even have forums inside the e-GMAT portal (for each Module and Question !) which helps us research our question before posting it on mail. 

In the beginning, I felt that mailing was too stretchy and tiring but I realised the beauty of structuring our thoughts on mail. In fact, this is even something that I am implementing in my office and my working style. Writing a structured mail allowed me to see my thoughts and half the doubts were cleared there and then. It was like writing a day journal. 

6) The LEARNING PROCESS is seamless. 
I studied a lot about HOW TO LEARN during my GMAT prep, and by the end of the prep I realised that e-GMAT had actually covered all the known methods and ways of learning through their course and their expert's suggestions. 

Visual Learning, Timely repetition, motivating us for note-taking, Quizzes and summaries etc. So I was quite impressed by the behavioural science used while creating this platform and the course. Kudos to the creators.

And most interesting thing is that all this seems to backed up by data. Which makes these structural decisions of the platform even more reliable and trustworthy.

7) Speaking of data. Every question had a good amount of data behind it. Meaning I could judge my time average of answering the question as compared to others. And how the mean and median students performed on accuracy. 

Each question had an elaborate explanation and a lucrative forum supporting it. 

8) Structured approach towards Verbal. I was shocked to see how eGMAT tutors understood the psychology of a student and created the Verbal course. 

They gave such a structure to approaching the Verbal section, which I am still in awe of how they creatively got it all together. So much data must have gone into the research to bring out a course that will suit all kinds of learners. 

Lastly, looking back, I see this score jump from 540 to 710 and though I would even give the credit to the schedule changes I made, the learning habits I incorporated and the support I received from my family, I could not have gotten this result if it wasn't for the data-driven support from e-GMAT.

Ohh and a shoutout to DJ and Rida, the experts who were constantly and tirelessly answering my mails without judging or avoiding any silly questions. Thank you. Also thanks Rida for going a mile ahead and getting on a video call to solve my CR and SC related doubts. 

There were many more points which I was impressed by. I am not sure if this is how other non-GMAT ONLINE Teaching portals are, but definitely, e-GMAT has created a benchmark for me that I will be using to judge the competency of the platform I am singing up for.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I heard about e-GMAT course from a friend of mine and after going through the online reviews of the course,I chose the 4 month course.

My instant impression was that the course was well thought of,streamlined and engrossing. Well thought of as it started from basic and foundational topics which were tested through interactive quizzes;building on the skills acquired through application/GMAT level quizzes;refinement through scholaranium and finally evaluation through sigma tests.

I needed to improve on the verbal section as my quant was fairly strong.I felt the Verbal section of the course to be the best (I solved mock free tests of other course providers as well in the past).There was no ambiguity in the e-GMAT content. Unlike all other content providers e-GMAT course simplified the Verbal section through the strategy and approach towards any subsection be it SC,CR or RC.It wasn't based on some abstract notion which a person doesn't know how to implement.There were clear meaningful methods to improve one's skills.Meaning based approach in SC reduced the otherwise confusion especially between 2 options. Elimination of incorrect options became a breeze. RC approach provided more clarity towards the approach. The best advice was to approach them as an article in a journal or as an editorial rather than as a tool which evaluates a test taker. My weakest section was CR. I always felt this section to be quite random which was at times quite frustrating However,e-GMAT explanations were mostly logical and helped me in formulating subcategories within the section to solve the questions more efficiently.

Scholarnium is the prefect stage to gauge one's understanding of the foundational skills and implementation potential.It not only has GMAT relevant questions and their explanations but also has in depth explanation about the attempts,accuracy,strength,weakness.It also provides quite a a lot of customization options as per the stage of one's preparation.All these inputs helped me increase my score from 640 to 720.

The only aspect which I feel can be added to the course is to have human connection i.e. e-GMAT experts reaching out to the student atleast twice during the course. I feel once during the mid course and then towards the end. A lot of insights are provided by the e-GMAT AI,but I feel e-GMAT expert can help in clear interpretation of the data.

I will definitely recommend the course for its vision,style and particularly the Verbal content!

																			by score report","Points","Location","I recently took the GMAT Online test and scored a 710 (V38, Q49), finally crossing the 700 barrier. My score in the first attempt was 650. Overall, E-GMAT has helped me gain a 60 point improvement with their mentorship program.

Coming from an engineering background, I never faced problems with Quant. Verbal however, was my weaker section where I was scoring in the range on V27-28 when I started off. With their specialised mentorship program, I was able to exactly find the pain points of my approach to Verbal questions and fix them. 

The E-GMAT pedagogy stresses on maintaining Error Logs. They believe in solving problem with the help of data and this approach clearly, works. Through my error logs, Atreya helped identify where I was going wrong in my approach. And my scores started automatically improving once we started fixing those errors one by one.
The meaning based approach completely changed my SC game and my accuracy improved drastically. 

E-GMAT mocks are also very helpful and are quite similar to the actual test. The level of mock analysis provided by them is unbelievable.They break everything down to identify the specific areas where the student went wrong. These tests might feel a bit more difficult than the actual test, but I feel that is always a good thing since it prepares you for the final test day.

																			by score report","","Location","Let me just start my review by thanking the creators of the course and Scholaranium . 

I would like to mention beforehand that everyone's preparation method is different and mine may not resonate with others. I literally used the course for 30 days (around 10 hrs per week). Due to my personal circumstances (having a 6 months old baby and full time job) I did not have enough time to go through the official guide. My strategy was just to practice questions and learn from  the solutions (only for the incorrect ones) and for that I extensively used the Scholaranium  and the practice test ( I purchased the official tests as well), 

For quant, when I gave the first official test, it became more or less clear that I needed to brush up the number systems and that's where I spent some time on (solving the number system questions) . Apart from that I didn't do much. I wonder if my quant score was a bit more only if I had spent more time on it. However, I made a point that every day I solved 2 questions each from different topics of quant  such as geometry, algebra, numbers etc.

Verbal was the section I mostly concentrated upon (with whatever time I had). I solved almost all the questions on Scholaranium  and solved it in practice test mode in order to keep time as well. My aim was to ace the sentence correction question as I thought these are the ones that can raise my score. Though , my final results say a different story. In my comprehensive test report, I realized that I aced the RC questions and my accuracy was 100% (Thanks to Scholaranium  questions).

I cannot insist anymore that if one has got limited time then all they need to do is practice practice practice (obviously look at the solution of the incorrect ones) 

I did not spend anytime on IRA (except while I was giving mock test). This is evident from my score of 5.
I did not spend any time on AWA (did not even practice during the mock tests) . While in the exam my sole aim was to find flaw in each line of the paragraph given and highlight it. I just followed a basic structure : 
First paragraph mentioning that the argument is flawed and list down at least 3 reasons for it. Next 3 paragraphs were spent on expanding the reasons mentioned in the very first paragraph one by one. I made sure to mention that what else the author could have included to make the argument stronger.  The final paragraph was just the conclusion that based on the reasons and the rationale above, it can be concluded that the argument is flawed.


Honestly, with my experience I would like to give whole credit to Scholaranium  and the mock tests as they essentially helped me to get an alright score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=53#","1","0","","","February 23, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey WishuSinha,

I have taken e-gmat course for my Verbal prep. And I have few points to share:
1. SC part is really good. Meaning based approach really worked for me.
2. CR part is very confusing and I would not like to recommend. It's very time consuming I believe.
3. RC is also fine but it depends on ones capabilities in verbal. I really liked the cementing section. But I feel if you are not good at Verbal then whether you have taken their RC course or not, it does not matter at all.

I did not get time to use their quant section much. But it is very lengthy.

Thank you so much for taking the time to post your review!

I am so glad to hear that you loved the SC course and the meaning-based approach! I can see that you put in a lot of time and effort into internalising the process and I am happy to hear that it helped you. Your input that the course is perfect for someone just starting their prep is also valuable.

I am sorry that CR was a sticking point for you. However, the reason is something you will find on your account - you kind of gave up on the course – your practice quiz scores needed to be at least 80% and then you did not cement what you learned. If you decide to retake the test, then I would recommend doing the CR course from scratch and following the cementing process to a tee so that you can iron out any gaps. I would also recommend studying just one subsection at a time.

Your CR Stats:  https://success.e-gmat.com/CR-Metrics

The RC course is built to explain techniques that will work for students with diverse abilities and they have, however I can understand that it may not have worked wonders for you. We will work hard on making sure we take your feedback. If you have more specific feedback, you must write to us and share it at support@e-gmat.com

While the Quant course is exhaustive (it targets all the potential topics you could be tested on in the GMAT), the P.A.C.E tool, with its diagnostic quizzes, allows you to target only your weak areas and creates an atomic learning path that would have allowed you to focus on just the areas that needed attention. Hence, it makes what looks like a lengthy course, super LEAN 😊

I am sorry that you were not able to achieve your dream score, but the path to success is dependent on diligence and following the process. It is essential that you take the right steps so that you can ensure you are on the path to success. We hope you take them soon!

We wish you all the best!

Cons - Students may probably sleep listening to their videos for Verbal. No feature of listening to videos at 1.5x/2x plus lack of mentorship from the company. The experience was more of singing up for some AI based service. 
SC may be a little average but a big big no for CR and RC.
Ideally such a well known company should have gone an extra mile to help students.
EGMAT team is quite unwilling to accept that their course was sub standard. I was wondering how a 4.9 review company can produce such a horrible course.

Thank you for posting your review and scoring a 700! It’s a commendable feat and you join a long list of our students to have achieved this. (With or without our help)

I am confounded by what you have stated in your review. While you seem like a diligent student who has put in the work to score a 700, your review does not speak volumes to that character.

For example, would a diligent sleep while watching videos that have helped thousands of students score 90th percentile for SC, CR & RC? Yes, it would surely be a waste of your preparation if you did sleep through the videos. Also, these videos are not meant to be played at that pace since the rate at which you should absorb is not 1.5x or 2x. There is intent behind it.
Another example of this, if your experience was just more of an “AI-based experience” – why would you feel that Scholaranium is amazing as a platform to practice. 

I would like to correct a few things you have stated in your review too -

1) We are not rated 4.9, we are rated 4.7 😊 
2) We did go the extra mile to help you – we had 2 experts go on a call with you to help you out, let alone the exchange of over 100 emails. 

I will leave you with this thought, you stated the course was sub-standard, especially for CR, RC – then why would you –
1)	Complete the entire CR course 
2)	Comment on the RC Course when you have not even completed it?

Your Course Usage - https://success.e-gmat.com/Your-Course-Usage

I will leave you with this thought, while the course is not for everyone – you used it, you were supported for it in every way possible, but we ACCEPT that the course is for diligent students, not everyone.

Having exhausted all the official material, I needed some quality questions and explanations to cement my concepts. That's when I scheduled a call with e-gmat team. After going through my ESR, I was told how I had some conceptual gaps. Having tried multiple resources, I wanted to give this a final shot. I started off my preparation with the structured approach. I believed the whole plan that was given to me in terms of finishing  SC, CR and RC and then moving to Quant. Changing my learning pattern from doing all concepts every single day to picking up one at a time, I initially hesitated. Nevertheless, I decided to believe the proven approach and finished concepts, concept quizzes, cementing quizzes and then moved to next module. This eventually built my confidence. After completing all modules, I started with the mocks. The quality of explanations there and the level of data insights  is definitely unparalleled. The Sigma-X mocks are slightly tougher than real exam but that prepares us for the grind. The tougher exam offsets the exam anxiety. I would ensure I spend more time analyzing the mock than writing the mock. In this whole process, whenever there is any doubt regarding the week plan or just to validate my own plan, I'd leave a mail to the team and they would get back within 24 hours proactively. Atreya has been there throughout the journey and also enrolled me into Last Mile program which helped me cement conceptual gaps in  last minute .

																			by score report","Points","Location","I studied for the GMAT for more than 3 months and gave the exam for the first time on Oct 17th, 2021. I was scoring an average of 710 in my official mocks and I simulated the experience almost perfectly. So I expected somewhere around that range. 

During the exam, the verbal section was way harder than I had imagined. I remember rushing through the last 7-8 questions and ended up guessing about 3 questions towards the end. Even the quant was way harder than what the official mock prepared me for. I was devastated to see a Q47, V31. 

I came back and took a few weeks off to figure out where I was going wrong. I knew all the Grammar rules, I had read the MGMAT SC book, I knew the basics of argument structures and attacking an argument. I realized I wasn't conceptually challenged but something was wrong in the process approach. I was getting my answer but it was taking too long and certain question types always threw me off. 

I took a consulting call from one of the strategy consultants at e-GMAT and they pointed out that my approach needs some honing and what I could do about it (I was really impressed that they didn't even try to sell the product and focussed more on me). A few weeks later I signed up for their 2 month program. But literally the next day I had to travel for an on-site project. After I was back, I had a month to go through the material and give the test again. 

Their SC module changed the way I looked at SC questions. I knew all the grammar rules and I was initially solving questions solely based on grammar. Their 3 step process for Sentence correction forced me to rewire my way of thinking about SC questions. After a few cementing quizes, my SC accuracy was higher than ever before and I was feeling very comfortable. 

I didn't have the time to go over the complete CR or RC modules (I probably wish I could) but I quickly gleaned a few approach strategies from a few modules and modified the way I approached verbal questions. Eg: I started making summary notes for RC passages and I started tabulating my CR arguments and derived an answer even before looking at the answer choices. 

I solidified my approach through quite a few practice quizzes and official mocks. The verbal question caliber was very high and indeed prepared me better for the real GMAT. 

For quant, I kept giving the GMAT Club tests and that helped a lot! I used to spend about 30 mins analyzing each Quant mock and made notes on every single strategy I missed. 

I gave the exam again just after recovering from the third wave hit. This time quant was quite seamless (I expected a Q50 but got a Q49) and I could complete the verbal section with a minute to spare. 

My verbal score jumped from a V31 to a V38 and I knew what exactly had changed during that month of prep and it was the approach. Not concepts. I highly recommend everyone to spend at least a month solidifying the approach and the timing (mocks, question banks) before giving the final exam. That small step boosted my score by 60 points. I do plan on giving the exam again to get to the 740 range.

I started browsing in internet and found out about E-gmat. I sent and email to them and Manas (an e-gmat mentor) got in touch with me immediately. As instructed by him, I took a mock exam available in the e-gmat course. The diagnosis he gave post my attempt was an eye opener. The main attraction was the analytics. It gave me clear idea on topics I was lagging behind. Then and there I decided to take the E-gmat course

The biggest advantage of E-gmat is that it is really comprehensive. They don't leave you with half hearted answer. There was logic behind every explanation. Even with topics like idioms (Which I had thought clearly favoured the native speakers), there was proper explanation. Each module is followed by quizzes which help you in cementing the topics that you learn

 Quant too was pretty comprehensive. One of the main problems I had faced was lack of time for preparation. The PACE application in E-gmat helped me in tackling this issue. With PACE, I was able to skip those modules which i was confident about . This helped in saving a lot of time

The final booster was the Last mile push programme. I was mentored by DJ, who helped me with the guidance on what to do after each step. Thanks to his expert diagnosis, I was able to realize which areas I was lagging behind, which helped in improving my score.

I would suggest E-gmat to anyone who is interested in taking GMAT. With it's comprehensive modules and in depth analytical data, one would be able to do well in the exams hands down","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=54#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Thank you for taking the time to write this review amidst your application deadlines. I truly appreciate this gesture 😊 However, your applications will become so much more effective with a 700 score that goes along with them now. 

I liked the fact that you mentioned explanations because most students firstly are not diligent to see every explanation and most explanations don’t do justice to questions.

But for an improvement like mine (V34 -V 40) I would instead suggest solving a whole of past years official questions and maintaining a proper error log and redoing the questions you get wrong.

Firstly, congratulations on your Verbal Improvement and for your 720.  

Thanks for your opinion about the product only working better for students who are starting off and not for ones who are at a certain level, but this is not true given the numerous success stories that we get every month from people improving from their late 650+ scores to 730 + scores. Tools like Scholaranium Skill Data, Sigma X Mocks help them so very much in their journeys. 

You can look at this success story I had responded to recently: https://gmatclub.com/forum/410-to-740-my-gmat-experience-375403.html?sid=22464348de5dfb0c5aa4fcd1ce884c8a 

The entire study plan depends upon the starting scores of the individual. If the student is starting off from an already high score, we suggest them to go through Stage 2 (Cementing Processes) which will identify the gaps to a sub-topic level which becomes easy for the student to then revise and patch up. This data will not be available elsewhere.  

Similarly, for Quants, we have an Adaptive learning methodology and course. This only teaches you what you NEED to know and saves a lot of time, giving maximum benefit out of the course. Needless to say, there are several success stories backing up this claim 😊 

I am very sure you would have liked the product if you had used it at least 10%. However, since you only did parts of the Master Comprehension course and the SC course, the entire product’s offering was not vivid to you. The below screenshot will show you that you have not used the product much. 

Screenshot: https://success.e-gmat.com/course-not-attempted-stats 

PS: To draw a parallel to your claim of resources being available for free: A lot of entertainment content is available for free; however, people still subscribe to OTT channels (Netflix, Prime Video, HBO, and so on), because of the wholesome experience they wouldn't get anywhere. Remember, good things are never free and free stuff has less value.  

Nonetheless, I thank you for your opinion and wish you all the best for your next steps!

Then, a friend from ISB suggested to take a demo class from EGMAT; I already knew that Verbal is my weakness as I was already scoring around 47-48 in Quant without any preparation. The way EGMAT focuses on Verbal section is phenomenal - I was rather shocked to know I was making mistakes on even verbal basics (P.S. I am sure there are a lot of people, especially non-native speakers, who are facing similar problems) but the way EGMAT addresses those areas for you is simply awesome. I started with SC, secondly approached CR and finally RC - the course is designed in such a great fashion that it builds momentum slowly and steadily so students can absorb to the entire core.

To highlight, Scholaranium has proved to be very helpful for additional practice. Also, one is advised to take mock tests after a fixed frequency, to check on yourself and EGMAT's sigma mock tests not only help with the same, but they will also highlight you with your weaknesses and techniques to turn them into your strengths - such is the power of the EGMAT course.

Furthermore, its Quant course helped me strengthen my core-basics and improved my timing on Quant questions. To sum-up, thank you to EGMAT team - I owe my GMAT score and my admit from ISB to EGMAT; couldn't thank you more.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=54#","7","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

The verbal and quantitative sections in the prep course are designed in such a manner to provide comprehensive review of the topics that you can find in the real GMAT exam. 
First of all, the course has specific subtopics in quant and verbal, in which one can solidify his fundamentals. The quant section, in my opinion, is generally little bit harder than the real exam, which is a good thing, since preparing for harder questions will definitely make it easier to score well in the real exam.
Also, the course has the scolaranium section, where one can practice a ton of questions with any difficulty and with detailed explanations as to why the right answer is the right answer and why all the others are wrong.

It covers everything from basics and prepares you to tackle the difficult SC questions. I improved significantly and learned to tackle the SC questions with a structured approach, saving precious time.
The CR section also introduces you to the different types of questions you may find GMAT and gives you enough practice to learn. The RC section could have some more difficult questions. I found the RC of GMAT to be more difficult than what I solved in RC practice questions. 

I bought the quant course only to practice questions and did not go through the whole course as it covered maths basics and I didn't need it, but it is great for someone who does not have a Maths background. 

I really liked the Scholarnium with clear classifications of questions by difficulty level. The analysis after you give a test is very helpful to understand where you can improve.

The mock tests were good but I didn't find them very close to the real GMAT. It is good for practice but please do not take the scores seriously, as the marking scheme is very different from what GMAT has.  But it does teach you time management and gives you a glimpse of what to expect in real GMAT.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Entering the GMAT world was so overwhelming with a ton of options available everywhere and I initially looked at the prep companies with a lot of scepticism. Once I was done exploring GmatClub and attending various webinars, I could figure out the most prominent players. I came across E-GMAT during that time, attending their free webinars every weekend to gain familiarity with the GMAT but never actually seriously considering it. I only took the plunge once my GMAT score had plateaued at 690 after 4 attempts over 2 years of self-preparation. Looking in hindsight now, how I wish I had gone for it earlier. Attending those free webinars, I always thought that E-GMAT had a methodical and simplified approach to the application of concepts and it became the reason I trusted them over others.

The product that E-GMAT has created is just phenomenal. A simple interface, yet one containing a ton of insights and data that gives you critical feedback points throughout your prep. If utilized in the correct way, following the step-by-step process that E-GMAT advocates, the Scholaranium platform is designed to help you succeed. The concept files, the Scholaranium question bank and the mocks are seamlessly integrated within the product and you don’t need to go outside this ecosystem.

The verbal prep from E-GMAT was an eye-opener for me. The course starts with strengthening the most basic fundamentals of understanding and constructing a sentence through the Master comprehension course. It significantly reduces your mistakes and prep time across all the sections. Mastering the meaning-based approach, deeply embedded throughout the SC course, will alone improves your SC ability on GMAT. The logical intended meaning of the question will always take precedence over the grammar rules.
Similarly, the pre-thinking approach taught in CR section forces you to think of possible answers before attempting a question until it becomes a habit. The attention given to each question type and subtype in CR course provides so many different perspectives of looking at a question stem. The course teaches the concept, and the approach and solidifies both through application files.

Every person has somewhat a unique approach to Reading comprehension; however, RC ability is built over time and the only way to do that is to read a lot. RC ability is tested by the GMAT over a range of topics that you may like or dislike. E-GMAT RC course focuses a lot on reading strategies that encourage you to read more actively and understand the intent of the author.

Quant course is even better. The course advocates a series of steps that help you solve a question under 2 minutes effectively. Its flexible enough to let you skip the stronger areas and extensive enough to work on your weak areas. Needless to say, all concepts tested on GMAT are present in Quant course and solving difficult level questions methodically gives a real boost to your quant ability whether you have a quant background or you don’t.

The scholaranium has one of the best question banks I have come across my prep and it’s aided by a lot of data points that help you identify your weak areas and fine tune your prep. You can see the performance statistics for the individual sections such as assumption, strengthen, etc. and further drill down to your performance over a number of attempted questions as well as the difficulty level. The takt time can also be seen to identify any timing issues over a particular set of questions. All these stats are based on the questions attempted via customizable quizzes that highlight non-ideal issues such as luck factor, rush factor, etc. The answers explanations are superb and in case of any query, every question has a discussion thread where answers are provided by E-GMAT experts.

E-GMAT mocks are also really good and closely resemble your ability as per GMAT. I can vouch for it because I had tried both official and Manhattan mocks, which are also awesome. The insights provided with the mocks are mind-boggling. They give you the sense of your block-wise timing, accuracy, etc. Its ESR + additional cool info. There are 6 Sigma-X mocks available in E-GMAT with each having its own question bank, so no repetitions. Leveraging my analysis of the mock, I transcended from a score of 660 on my sigma-X mock to 740 on my actual GMAT just 3 days later.

Lastly, the support provided by E-GMAT mentors complements everything mentioned above and really is the difference between getting a good (sub-700) vs an awesome (720+) score. I was lucky enough to be engaged in the Last mile push program by Dhananjay (DJ) who gave me a structured and personalized plan right from the beginning. I was already saturated with 4 attempts on GMAT and yet I learned so many things in my 5th attempt that I didn’t before. DJ pushed me a lot to do that introspection and get over my weak areas. He helped me analyse my performances through the error logs and came up with key inputs or training videos from time to time whenever I got stuck in a particular section. He kept me accountable by setting up the weekly milestones. There was I time when I got frustrated and wanted to move to another section but DJ quickly identified that word problems was my weak area and helped me improve my ability to 80% from 30% in the section. Despite helping so many students, his replies were always prompt and always carried I tinge of motivation that is so much needed when you are trying to ace the GMAT.

To sum up, if you want all-in-one package for GMAT prep, you don’t need to look elsewhere.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=55#","0","0","","","January 19, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Ankur,

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started with a score of 680(Q49V34) in my official practice test in September. I had planned to prepare for two months. Since I prefer learning through a structured course, I searched online and came across e-gmat. I liked the structure and content and signed up for it. What I enjoyed the most about e-gmat was Payal's video lectures. I really appreciate the time and dedication she and the team have put into providing such excellent explanations. The concepts are very well explained, and I felt great re-learning some of them. It didn't translate to an increase in my quant score, but I thoroughly enjoyed learning things like probability which I was previously nervous about. The tabular approach for distance and rate related problems helped me become more confident tackling these problems. In Verbal section, Pre-thinking for CR questions was very helpful. Their approach for solving bold-faced questions was super useful and I started to enjoy solving them.

The biggest mistake I made during my preparation was trying to complete reviewing all the concept videos before taking up mock tests. If I were to do it again, I would have simultaneously taken mock tests every weekend while going through the concept videos and also not try to complete all the videos in a short sitting.

Because I hadn't practiced enough, I was super nervous for my first attempt. I hadn't developed my time management skills either. I ended up exceeding my break time between Quant and Verbal by 4 minutes. That along with my lack of sleep and anxiety contributed to a super low score, much lower than my first practice test. I had to cancel immediately.

I planned to prepare better for my next attempt. I realized that it wasn't that I wasn't good enough to get a good score. It was that my approach was not right. I reached out to the e-gmat support team and decided to follow their advice promptly. Atreya first responded and suggested taking the practice quizzes and completing the cementing stage. When I reached out again a couple of days before my test, DJ responded with helpful suggestions. The guidance provided by the e-gmat team was also very helpful in taking the required quizzes which prepped me better and helped reduce my test-day anxiety.  I was able to get a score of 740 (Q49V42) in December. 

One thing which I felt could be improved in the e-gmat course was providing an overview of what the Sentence Correction is testing us on and what the different kinds of errors are. I could have missed this as I went through all the videos and concepts of this section without really understanding the application of them. I really struggled with SC and it was only after going through Gmat Ninja's YouTube videos that I was able to grasp the bigger picture better. After that, the Scholaranuim quizzes certainly helped cement the concepts.

Overall e-gmat has great content, practice quizzes, and support available. I would definitely recommend it. For others who are reading this, I would say please plan to leverage all their resources, reach out to their support team early, take as many practice quizzes regularly even if you don't feel ready, and continually iterate on your approach, see what is working and what isn't.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=55#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I've had the e-GMAT course for a few months now and must say that it's a great investment made along my GMAT journey, especially after I enrolled in eGMAT's LMP program. Below I'll summarize a few points about the e-GMAT platform and the LMP program that I found particularly valuable, as well as a few tips on how best to use eGMAT's course. Hopefully this can help you on your preparation journey! 

The Platform

1. The Verbal Course. The bulk of my focus on eGMAT's platform was in its SC and CR courses, and I must say that the SC course in particular was a complete game-changer. The combination of 1) long and comprehensive list of grammar topics on the platform and 2) eGMAT's unique meaning-based approach helped me tremendously in my SC preparation, helping me push from SC ~70% to 90%+. The ""Mastering Comprehension"" modules in the Verbal course was also very useful, since it teaches not factual knowledge but a way of thinking that helps you focus on the core task of identifying meaning and errors in SC questions. 

2. The Quant Course. Compared to my usage of the Verbal course, I spent relatively less time on the Quant course. However, I was still able to see that the course covered an extensive list of all the topics that you need to know for the exam. Not only that, but there were also tips and tricks for individual topics that can help you minimize the time you spend on each question, and the explanations for all the topics were very clear and easy to understand. 

3. Scholaranium. I have to say that Scholaranium is by far the best Q-bank platform that I have seen in my journey - it allows you to customize your practice according to your individual progress. The Sigma-X mocks were also fantastic and mimic the algorithm used in the real exam. I really liked how each question's topic is indicted in the review screen for the mocks, so you can go back to each specific module if you find that you are still lacking in that particular topic. 

The LMP Program 

I reached out to the eGMAT team a few weeks before my 4th GMAT attempt in a panic attack at not seeing my score improve after months of preparation. For people who don't know, the LMP program is a mentorship program offered by eGMAT to selected students (so it's not a public purchase option on their website), and the plan is to have a mentor help you during the last few days/weeks of your preparation journey to pinpoint and get rid of your last weaknesses before the real exam. DJ quickly replied to my email, and we met together to go over the ESR for my previous 2 GMAT attempts. In our meeting, DJ analyzed my ESR extensively, and I was really surprised at how quickly he could see where exactly I was going wrong. Based on these weak spots, DJ made a customized 10-day plan for me that included 3 components: Verbal, Quant, and Test-Readiness. Each section was extremely detailed as to what I needed to do EXACTLY for those last few days of my attempt: for example, during our meeting DJ quickly pinpointed that one major weakness/mistake that I was making in Verbal was that I took too much time to solve some of the questions that I still ended up getting wrong, so he told me what exact steps I needed to take to reduce the time I spend on Verbal questions. With his customized plan and the eGMAT platform, I improved from 660 (my first Sigma-X mock score) to 710 (Official GMAT score). After my GMAT, I also discussed my exam and preparation experience with DJ, and I've decided to try the GMAT one more time to aim for a higher score. I have no doubt that, with the help from DJ and the eGMAT platform, I can push my score even higher.

How to Use the Platform

The course at eGMAT teaches you a 3-step approach that helps you first cement your foundational knowledge and then practice and perfect your skills at answering specific question types, and I have to say that these 3 steps held a lot of importance in the final stages of my journey. It is truly not the case in which you can just do all the questions in Scholaranium and hope that magically lifts up your score - it is extremely important to follow the 3-step approach and keep an error log with eGMAT's error log templates to make sure that you know where you are faltering in your question-solving process. The best series of steps that helped me to solidify my knowledge and skills were as follows: 

Learn basic knowledge in courses --> Do preliminary practice questions within individual modules --> Review concepts if necessary --> Begin taking small quizzes on different sections in Scholaranium --> Keep updating the error logs --> Find out which areas I was weakest in and go back to those specific modules --> Practice specifically with those question types","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=55#","0","0","","","January 19, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear jlo1234,

I love the username by the way! Jennifer Lopez is one of my favorite singers, haha! Congratulations on scoring 710 and I am glad the LM program brought you quick success! 10 days, was it? I thoroughly enjoyed this engagement. I like your mini-guide around our course and the LM program – so innovative 😊

50 points 10 days  Here is how: https://success.e-gmat.com/ESR-Data-J

I want to applaud you for 2 things –

1)	Your faith & trust in me and the advice I gave  Right off the bat when we did the call, I felt that you were bound for success because you understood the value in what I was saying and followed through with the plan.
2)	Diligence  Creating a hyper-specific plan: I created this, but you followed it. From my experience anyone that follows even 90% of this plan – they improve their chances of success by 2X or 3X.

Hyper specific Plan Teaser (I know so many people want this):  https://success.e-gmat.com/Hyperspecific-Plan-Teaser

I don’t think there is a review that gives someone a roadmap on how to use our course till now which makes this review ultra-special.

I look forward to helping you increase this score too! Above and beyond always.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started off with my preparation in April 2021. The biggest challenge for me was to break the inertia of not studying for 6 years during the course of my professional life. I have a 6-day working schedule, so tsking out ample amount of time to study was challening. I started off with Manhattan guide of Quant because I had been from Engineering background and Quant flows easily for me. After some time I realised that it got quiet boring for me to go through the concepts from that book. I consulted one of my friends and he suggested me to take an eGMAT course. I read many reviews of e-GMAT on GMAT Club and found it quiet interesting.
I enrolled in the Q+V course in May-21. I did a mistake of not taking a sigma-X mock at the beginnning, so I am not aware where I stood before I started off with the course. I started off with Sentence correction in Verbal course. The course was very detailed and comprised of everything required for the SC course. The forum of e-GMAT is an excellent feature. All the previous doubts asked are available on the form. So if any doubt arises in the topic, I found them discussed on the forum previously. There is a ready reference of all the doubts other students have regarding the topic/module that is being studied. I made very detailed notes of SC which eventually helped me to revise all the concepts of the module at a go. While going through the course, I realised the English we used in the normal conversation s way too flawed. The main punch line for the SC is the meaning based approach. I firstly learnt to understand the meaning of the sentence by breaking it into small chunks and then check for grammatical errors in the sentence. It took me about a month to complete the course. I practiced SC from scholaranium and used strategic review to analyse the mistakes I was doing. The strategic review is also an amazing process to analyse mistakes. It actually points out where you are faultering. I used it to improve on SC.
I further did CR modules. CR is a logic based analysis in which there are 2-3 elements linked with each other. We need to analyse those linkages and find the must-be-true situations for the conclusion to hold true. Accordingly, for the strengthener and weakener questions we need to hit one of those linkages to make the argument strong and weak respectively. e-GMAT gave a very clear idea of how to attempt a CR question. The main punch line for CR is pre-thinking. Just take around 15-20 seconds after reading the passage to apply negation test. This really helped me to reach the assumption of a given passage. I faced problem when I pre-thinked well and the answer choices didn't have any suitable choice matching my pre-thinked assumption. I used to panic and mark any option randomly in those cases. I used scholaranium a lot to counter this problem in CR. Of course, strategic review is again a saviour. It points out exactly where you falter. So I was good at pre thinking, but bad at analysing and visualising the answer choices. There is much of probability that the answer choice won't match the pre-thinked assumption. So main thing I learnt was to not to panic and try to visualise what answer choice is pointing onto.
I further did RC modules. RC is a very scoring area. e-GMAT mainly outlined how to comprehend the passage at one-go. So, the key to attempt RC is to read the passage with full involvement and again breaking the sentences into smaller chunks to understand the idea presented by each sentence. The key-words play a very important role in deciding such roles. So if you comprehend the passage properly by may be making very short notes, you dont need to come back to the passage while attempting the questions. I faced problem when the passage was out of my interest area like biology or humanities. I found it boring and didn't read the details through it and eventually faultered in the questions.Also, I was taking a lot of time to complete one passage with all the questions. Its just that you need to believe that whatever is aked in the question is right there in the passage. You just need to read and comprehend the passage properly. So once I came out of the comfort zone and read the passage with full compassion and made short notes while reading, I was able to solve the RC questions in minimal time while it took me 5 minutes to read the whole long passage.
Even though I was good at quant from childhood, I decided to revise all the concepts at one go from e-GMAT modules. They were quiet comprehensive and you may personalize the study plan according to your strong and weak areas in Quant. I took quiet a bit of time to complete quant from the e-GMAT modules. I realised few of my weak areas and spent more time on it to improve overall accuracy of quant.
After completing quant and its practice, I gave my first sigma mock ang got a 680 in the mock. There were few areas in both verbal and quant which I neede to fix. I revised all the areas I faultered and again gave a mock and score 650. It was quiet shocking for me. Specially in verbal, I was struggling a lot with the timing. I was able to complete 30 questions and randomly guessed last 6 questions due to time constraints. It was just one week from exam and the results shook me up.
Dhananjay came to my rescue. He told me that I am having process related gaps in SC and CR which need to be fixed. He also advised me to reschedule the GMAT by around 20-30 days. I took a day to think and decided to reschedule the exam. I postponed the exam by a month. DJ
helped me to identify the areas I needed to work on. While solving the SC problem, I wasn't focusing on the sentence structure. I worked on the sentence structure and practiced with OG questions. Initially the timing to complete a SC question increased from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes for me but eventually as I got used to with the process, making the sentence structure and solving the problem became a habit to me. It actually helped me to understand the intended meaning of the sentence and to identify the errors(grammatical and logical) in the sentence very easily.
Accordingly, I made an error log to identify the conceptual and process related gaps and kill the gaps appropriately.
For CR, DJ advised me to follow revision B module. I revised all the application files of the CR course and then solved questions from scholaranium. I further made an error log to identify the gaps. Also, he asked me to make a video of how I solve a CR question. DJ reviewed the same and told me that I am pre-thinking well and visualising the answer choices also. I need to work on negation test. I wasn't negating the statement properly. I worked on negation test of conclusion and answer choices. Eventually, I got better at solving CR.
For RC, I was taking quiet a bit of time to complete the passage. I practiced the comprehending part of the passage for some time and realised that the time to attempt the questions decreased.
I finally gave a mock and scored 720. I was still struggling with time in verbal in the last 2-3 question but I gained confidence that I can improve it further with a strategy. I decided to break the complete set of questions in verbal in equal parts and allocated time to the questions. I practiced it on GMAT club test and found that I improved my time management of verbal section.
For IR section, I just did the OG questions. I found them enough for practicing the real GMAT like IR questions. IR is a mix of verbal and quant.I found spending 1-2 days for IR was enough for me.
For AWA, I read on 7-8 passages on GMAT Club and Manhattan to get an idea of how a passage is written. I practiced 3 passages and found it enough.
Exam day experience: I had exam anxiety and slept barely for 4 hours before my exam. I meditated in the morning. I had headache due to lack of sleep but I was determined that I wont let it interfere during my exam. I just tried to pacify myself of all anxieties by deep breathing.I gave my exam in order - Q-V-IR-AWA. This order worked for me because the exam anxiety in the beginning gets down with my strong area- Quant; mind gets warmed up and I can concentrate better. I admit that if I would have slept for 4 more hours,the score would be at least 20 points more, but I managed to get a 710.(Q49-V38-IR6-AWA5)

Tips:
1. There is a lot of self control needed while doing such a preparation. I meditated intermittently to keep myself calm. One can follow the same.
2. In SC, look on the meaning first. Don't jump blindly for grammatically correct choices. There may be more that one choice which is grammatically correct but doesn't convey the intended meaning.
3. In SC, try to make sentence structure. It shall make your work easier to understand meaning and identify errors.
4. In CR, try to visualise the linkages between different elements and then prethink to reach on the assumption. Finally dont panic if you dont find the pre thinked assumption in the choices. Just visualise the choices keeping in mind the linkages.
5. In CR, try to check for must be true cases. There may be some cases that are necessary but not sufficient or sufficient but not necessary. Try to rule out such cases.
6. In RC, try to comprehend the passage as much as you can. Make very short notes to keep key words in mind. This will save your time in solving question related to the passage.

Thanks giving: e-GMAT has a big role to play in getting to that score. The forums have been amazing. The SMEs reply promptly to all the queries. For me, DJ made final fixing to push me further towards the score.

I honestly think that the most undervalued part of our product is our Forums. I know you made good use of them. A serious problem most students face when they begin studying for the GMAT is the lack of good explanations out there, not everyone is born with a V40 spoon in their mouths! :D

I still remember the call we had! I told you that scoring a 700+ wasn’t possible in a week and you’d need 20-30 days. I know it took some time for you to consume that information but thank you for trusting my judgment. You gave me the opportunity to bring out the potential in you. This is when the entire teaching pedagogy from the SC, CR & RC came together.

I am so proud of the work you put into this, and I know you will crack the B-school you want soon!

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took the GMAT in November of 2021 right before Thanksgiving. I scored a 660. I was super disappointed. I didn't know how to move forward. I saw all the online reviews e-gmat has, and I decided to take a call with on of there strategy experts. I explained to him that I was signing up for a re-take and that I was studying from the OG. He told me not to go down that route. I had very little time before my next exam which was only 2 weeks after my last attempt. I trusted e-gmat with my final preparations.  I ended up scoring a 710! I was shocked how quickly things changed. 

I wanted to highlight some specifics about the course. I primarily focused on the SC portion of the course because I needed a refresher. I was so impressed with how COMPREHENSIVE the entire course was. After taking 2 other well-known courses on this forum, I can hands down say e-gmat is the best. The meaning base approached really changed how I look at SC. Before I use to think it was all just random explanations and I was frustrated because I wasn't making progress. The meaning based approach made even the most difficult SC problems a breeze. 

The support staff on the forums are there to answer your questions and they do so in a timely manner. The forums are also rich with queries from other students who share the same problems as you, so often you can just get your answer from prior posts. You will always see Payal and Stacey on the forums answering your questions. It feels good to know the same experts in the videos are answering your questions below. 

Scholaranium 2.0 is such a game changer. I was so impressed with how gmat-like the questions were. There are so many questions in the bank and the explanations have both video and text explanations. Each answer is thoroughly explained. 

Similarly, Sigma-X mocks are just so precise. They identify your true weak points down to subsection levels. This allows you to truly figure out your weaknesses and address them. Before I kind of just thought I knew what my weaknesses were, but this brought in the data to tell me exactly what they were. Without this I would not have been as effective in my studies. 

The quant course is also unmatched. My biggest fear on quant was always seeing a new type of question on the test hat I had never seen before. This course really touches all of quant and leaves no stone unturned. The way the diagnostics and learning concept files are setup makes it super easy to approach quant with confidence. The video explanations are so through and the forums have rich answers. I was truly impressed with the level of quality and the breadth of problems on the quant course. 

If you're at any stage of your gmat preparation, it's crucial that you check out e-gmat. The level of time, effort, and quality put into this platform is unmatched. I know because I was with 2 other platforms prior to e-gmat. I wish I could have gone back and just started with this platform. I would have saved so much time and headache.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took up E-Gmat after doing a X-sigma mock test. What intrigued me was detailed the feedback on my verbal and quant ability - very similar to getting an ESR for the actual GMAT. This was unlike the first platform i was using and given the short time i had, I needed something prescriptive in telling me where i was struggling and give me targeted conceptual videos to do that. I love how E-Gmat equips with all the major habits that help you pass 700 - they provide you with error logs for each component, they have a conceptual quiz to test both your conceptual understanding and your GMAT test taking ability for that topic (a distinction that i only realised via e-Gmat), they also test not just your accuracy but your timing on certain questions. It helped me pinpoint my weaknesses so well for verbal especially where I struggled initially with understanding where in my ""thinking"" i was going wrong. It makes enforcing the discipline of getting concept right, getting test taking ability right and getting both accuracy & speed very straightforward, and makes attaining a good GMAT score more of a methodical process than a monumental task.

Scholaranium is TOUGH and super humbling but is integral to achieving high scores consistently because they have selected the right questions to target even the most nuanced understanding of concepts and test-taking skills. If you use the lectures, scholaranium, keep an error log, hitting 700+ is a straightforward. I find that extremely telling of a superior platform. Even after scoring 710, I am convinced i can do much better so have even extended my access so i can squeeze out the additional 40 points for my GMAT. I am confident e-GMAT will help me get there.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=55#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I was connected to one of the members of eGMAT prior to my purchase of the course. In the meeting I was shown around their website, the portal, Scholaranium 2.0, and the verbal course material.

Post my enrollment in the course, I was invited to an onboarding session in which I was told about the best practices on using the Scholaranium 2.0 and the course videos. I took a diagnostic test and based on the assessment of that, I was assigned a mentor (DJ!!) who gave me feedback on my ability and created an overall plan for my preparation, which revolved around the target score that I had specified.

The overall course is designed in a 3-stage manner and students have an option to skip to Stage II if they are confident about their skill levels in certain sections. Based on personal taste, I decided to go through the entire course since I felt that skipping a few concept files would mean that I am impatient :P

I was constantly in touch with DJ, on a weekly basis. He would share hyper-specific and personalized plans, particularly designed for my weak areas. They ranged from concept files, how to take revision notes, how to effectively revise etc. What helped in these feedback sessions/plans was that DJ was very calm and confident about the process. ""Trust the process"" really resonated with me during this journey. Along with that,  eGMAT, with Scholaranium 2.0, utilizes quiz data to analyze weak areas within each subsection (SC, CR etc) and based on that the support team guide you on corrective actions.

I essentially followed the plan and took the Sigma X mocks when I was asked to go for it. Towards the end of my preparation, DJ had noticed a weakness in SC and gave me a Sentence Correction booster plan, that I followed throughout the last week before my exam date. I think it helped me refresh my ability and ensure that my ability is fresh for the main day.

Overall, the 6 month long journey was a very planned one, with lots of useful feedback and data. I think the mentorship program was a really huge factor in ensuring that everything is planned and executed well. I am glad I made that choice ^_^

																			by score report","","Location","This was my fourth attempt at the GMAT and I knew that this was probably going to be my last chance at breaking the 700 barrier. I gave my first attempt back in 2017 and I got a below 600 score. It was self-study using Official books, Manhattan guides and YouTube videos. For my next two attempts in 2018 (610 Q44 V31) and 2019 (640 Q48 V31) I enrolled for e-GMAT but I could not do the course properly and had to rush through the course because of my personal and work commitments. The way e-GMAT course is built, I knew it was the only course that was going to help me break the 700 barrier. So naturally I decided to go with e-GMAT for my fourth attempt and it finally worked wonders as I was finally able to get a score of 710 Q49 V37. 

I started with Verbal section, and covered each topic as designed in the course. e-GMAT SC course is pure gold. All the topics in SC is super simplified. Meaning based approach in SC set a solid foundation for solving SC questions. Once you understood what the sentence was trying to communicate, it was easy to eliminate all the incorrect answer choices by applying the grammar rules. Meaning based approach was especially helpful when you have two grammatically correct choices and you have to eliminate the incorrect choice. CR course is based on Pre-thinking approach. At the start of the course, all the different parts of CR passage such as premise, fact, claim, conclusion, main conclusion, author’s point etc are clearly defined. Honestly it takes time to completely hone the pre thinking approach to arrive at assumptions. But once you consistently follow the step-by-step method to find conclusion, falsification condition and assumptions, solving CR questions using pre thinking approach becomes easy. Once I fully got the hang of the approach, I never took notes while solving CR questions. Arriving at assumptions even before looking at the answer choices saves you a lot of time while eliminating answer choices, which eventually helped me in pacing the test. While solving RC questions you use few concepts learnt in CR course. I always felt that RC was my weak area. So, I focused more on improving my ability in SC and CR than on spending too much effort on RC. One thing that I did differently this time in my preparation was that I used the cementing quizzes after each section diligently to get the desired accuracy in medium and hard questions before proceeding with the next section. This helped solidify the concepts I learned during the initial stages. I realized the value of doing cementing quizzes when I returned to verbal course again after months of doing Quant section. When revising I did not spend much time relearning the concepts, saving myself a lot of time. 

Qaunt course in e-GMAT has improved significantly from 2018. The new Quant 2.0 was detailed and the summary at the end of each section was helpful during revision. I followed the same approach for qaunt with regards to cementing quizzes – getting desired accuracies in both medium and hard questions, before proceeding with next topic.  

Scholaranium is a wonderful tool from e-GMAT. This is super helpful when you want to solidify your learnings, improve time management and understand your strong or weak area by giving mixed quizzes – combining all the sections in verbal or different sections in quant. By giving multiple cementing quizzes, ability quizzes and ability quizzes you are improve both your accuracy and your ability while getting comfortable with skipping questions during the tests. Do not forget to do strategic review and make notes after each attempt and before giving another attempt. OG questions feel relatively easier than the questions in scholaranium.  

Lastly, the support from the e-GMAT team was wonderful. They supported me with my queries, with my subscription extensions and also pointed out my weaknesses and a way forward whenever I mailed asking for help.

I then saw a tutorial video on the GMAT club youtube channel by Payal, co-founder of e-GMAT. I read some reviews online and decided to invest and took the 2-month course. A strategy expert connected with me to help me prepare a plan to reach my overall planned score then it was 680. It was suited to my planning and hours I could invest per week. The video tutorials, application-based practice tests, scholaranium - cementing, and ability quizzes whose data is projected per section per topic showing average time and accuracy with detailed explanation for all questions were really helpful in improving my verbal score. During the last 3 weeks of my course, e-GMAT introduced PACE which really helped me go through the quant section in minimal time to improve my quant score.

I was not able to fully keep up with my plan for the entirety of two months because of work and the holiday season (had family over) but had I focused for the entirety of the course, I would have crossed my target score.

If you are looking for an overall score improvement, I would recommend e-GMAT. The Subject experts are really helpful and do respond to queries well within 12-15 hours.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","","","January 05, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Yogesh,  

Congratulations on scoring a 650. Reaching your target score in 2 months is a great achievement.  

You have improved from V21 to V31 despite not having a lot of time to study due to your job and family commitments. I love the fact that you enjoyed PACE and that it helped you save time at the Quant side of prep. View the screenshot below to understand one such instance.

Your focussed approach towards Verbal was also commendable. You did the course well and in turn, your Scholaranium quiz scores were good. For a student looking to improve in verbal, doing the course well and Scholaranium is two very important aspects. See the screenshot below to understand your performance.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I had joined another coaching institute before and even after several attempts my score was stuck at 680. So, I decided to go ahead with e-gmat after one of my friends scored a 760 with their help. I am so glad I made that decision, with e-gmat’s help I got a 710 and am optimistic about getting a 750+ in my next attempt.
Two things that stood out for me were:
1.	The adaptive nature of e-gmat and the detailed analysis provided by them our accuracy and time subsection-wise and question type-wise. Their Sigma-X mock tests, Scholaranium cementing and ability quizzes are incredibly helpful in terms of not only replicating the difficulty level of the actual exam but also analysing our performance and providing in-depth solutions,
2.	The 24/7 support I received from my mentor Atreya sir truly made all the difference. As an individual, I tend to procrastinate a lot but sir was always there to tailor plans for me and keep me pushing to achieve the targets he set for my gmat journey. Atreya sir constantly analyzed my performance on the platform and suggested customized, hyper-specific plans to work on my key areas of improvement. In fact, after my recent attempt, he shared a video analyzing my ESR and pointed out what I should be doing in the coming weeks in order to get that 750+ score.

With their remarkable insights, adaptive nature of their quant modules, and commendable techniques (especially their meaning-based approach and Pre-Thinking) to ace the verbal section, e-gmat is one of the best gmat courses out there. I have personally recommended to a lot of people over traditional coaching institutes. The amount of personalization and 1:1 mentoring especially in the LMT program is phenomenal. 

If you’re looking to achieve your target score in the least amount of time with maximum personalization and top-notch mentoring, e-gmat is your best bet!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Before I started my preparations with E-Gmat in May-21, I had  already appeared for GMAT once in Jan-2019. It was my first attempt and I had performed poorly in that exam. That day i got to know that the rules are not enough to clear the GMAT. I took a break from GMAT and then decided to seriously prepare for it in Feb-2021. I thought of doing the OG and questions from GMAT Club. I  majorly focused on Sentence Correction ,and the questions from OG and GMAT club did seem to improve my ability on SC. Since my performance in CR and RC was not upto mark, I decided to take some expert help. I got to know about E-GMAT from a friend of mine and decided to contact them. They asked me to write one sample test before suggesting anything. I was shocked to see that even after two years my score had not improved. I decided to go with E-GMAT complete package.
I took my first test(post E-Gmat subscription) on Sep-2 and scored a 680 with V-37 and Q-46. I was quite shocked by the quant score. Though it was an improvement, the score was way below my expectations
. I decided to reappear for the exam in November and started by focusing on Quant more. I finished almost all of the E-Gmat's quant questions. I gave the Online-GMAT but was let down by the glitches in the online software. Thanks to my proctor, GMAC refunded my money and I rescheduled my test for Dec-16. On the day of exam, I was not worried about the exam. I finished my sections well within time and was surprised to see a 730 at the end of the test. E-GMAT's course trained me to an extent that I eventually scored a great score after much hard-work.
 

Verbal

SC- The SC section is one of the highlights of E-GMAT. I would definitely recommend E-GMAT specially for this section. The questions test your understanding not just the grammar  rules. The Modifier section has been covered in detail.

CR- The CR section, though not as strong as the SC section, trains you on how to logically solve the GMAT questions. By the time I was done with the CR section, I was able to solve most of the questions. 

RC- The best thing about RC section is that it trains the mind to identify the trap answers. Once you are trained enough, you""ll be able to achieve 80+% accuracy on RC.

Quant-
E-GMAT's Quant is good to build on the basics and practice on some tough questions. The questions aren't exactly GMAT style , but the course clears the concepts to a level that it becomes easy to solve the GMAT type questions. 

The Scholaranium 2.0 and Sigma Mocks provide a range of questions to practice from and train yourself for the real test.

I would recommend E-GMAT to people who want to have a solid foundation on all the concepts-Verbal and Quant.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","","","January 03, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Rajat, 

Congratulations on the 730 score! We are very happy to have been your partner in this journey.

Two important things that stood out in your review for me are: 
1. Rules by themselves are not enough to ace the GMAT 
2. In your latest attempt you felt prepared to the extent that a high score was more a certainty than a wish 

Your first point is very pertinent. You may know everything there is to about a topic in theory but if you do not know how to apply it to a question or how to approach a GMAT question it will not be enough. This is where the Application files in Verbal course and Practice Skills and GMAT Skills files in Quant course play an important role and I see that you put in the required effort there. This ensured that you had a reliable and repeatable process to answer all the questions on the GMAT. 

Verbal Course Stats - https://success.e-gmat.com/Verbal-Course-Stats 

Feeling of confidence about your preparation comes from seeing the desired results over and over again through your prep. When I saw your account, I noticed that you worked through all 3 stages of learning and scored well on over 900 questions on Scholaranium.

																			by score report","","Instructor","I spent long time figuring out which GMAT course I wanted to try out. After reading a variety of reviews I decided to go for E-GMAT and I do not regret that decision at all.

E-GMAT's online study course is very good, especially on verbal. I think it got the best SC section of all the courses (I have also seen a few others), leading to my 87th SC percentile score. The SC course is very comprehensive and goes through EVERY RULE you need to know. Scholarium is also great, providing a fantastic learning platform. It breaks down your performance on e.g. verbs, modifiers etc, in which is really great. 

I was fortunate to get invited into E-GMAT's last mile programme with Atreya as mentor. He was always positive and provided help when I needed so, for e.g. setting up a tailored study plan. We had meetings over Teams and he gave me tailored videos e.g. going through the ESR, in which was very helpfull, so thanks for that!

Another great thing with the course is that if you have any question you can just send it to customer support or post it on the forum and you receive an answer within 24h. I was in the Last Mile program and sent directly to Atreya, and he always responded in great fashion.

I also tried out the quant course but my focus was on the verbal section as I got Q48/Q49 without much troubles. 
I also tried the sigma mock, but only once. It seems to be fairly accurate.

I can really recommend the course, especially if you are struggling with the verbal section. SC/CR/RC section is great both in terms of online videos and questionnaire bank in the Scholarium. It provided you the tools you need to get strong score in verbal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","","","January 03, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Student,

																			by score report","Points","Location","My journey from 600 to 730 has not been an easy one but I would surely say that it has been a fulfilling one; one filled with stress, pressure and anxiety but more importantly one of hope, hard-work and resilience.

After underperforming in my first two attempts [I scored 600 (Q47, V26) and 650 (Q47, V33)], I realized that my approach in solving the verbal questions (especially SC and RC) was not right. I knew that to reach the elusive 700 mark, I would have to start from scratch and change my approach.


I started researching about various courses and came across e-GMAT on GMAT Club. I signed up for the free trial and to my surprise, I learnt so many new things in those modules itself. I signed up for the full course immediately (the best decision I took during the whole journey). e-GMAT course worked wonders for me. The course structure, scholaranium and the personalized study plan stood out to me.


Highlights of the Verbal Course:

MC- The MC module was the best way to start the verbal course. It provides excellent reading strategies that lay a solid foundation to do well in the verbal section. This course drove my improvement in RC. My accuracy improved from 50% to 80% by the time I finished the RC module.

SC- SC went from being my weakness to my strength in 20 days. The comprehensive meaning-based approach improved my accuracy from 50% to 90%. After I completed the module, I was very confident in selecting the right answer and in rejecting the four incorrect choices.

CR- CR was always my strong point in the section. The module helped me brush up some conceptual gaps and the diversity of questions gave me exposure to attempt any type of question that came on the D-Day.


After going through the verbal course, I was confident in touching the V40 mark. I moved on to the quant modules. 

I was confident in my quant skills before starting the modules. The quant 2.0 course is quite comprehensive. It makes complex topics such as absolute values and inequalities easy to understand. Yet, to my dismay, quant became my weaker of the two sections. After finishing the NP and WP modules, I took the first sigma-X mock and scored 750 (Q44, V47). Q44 was a shocker for me. After completing the other modules, I took the second mock and scored 770 (Q48, V46). I was happy with my quant score but I wanted- to reach to Q49-50.


After the second mock, DJ first reached out to me through the Last Mile Program. We had a call to analyse the first two mocks. He made me realize that I was struggling to manage my time well in the quant section. I usually ended up guessing the last 4-5 questions. He gave me the first milestones with a major focus on overcoming the time management issue using the cementing quizzes. I started maintaining a quant error-log and re-did the algebra and geometry modules. I took the third mock four days before my third attempt and scored 750 (Q49, V42). I was quite happy to see the Q49. DJ shared a well-detailed plan for the last three days. I was shocked when I scored 680 (Q46, V37) in the fourth mock two days before the exam and thus, lost all my confidence. DJ tried to calm me down and motivate me but I walked into the test center full of anxiety. I managed a decent 690 (Q45, V39) but I was not happy. I knew I could do so much better. I was mentally tired of the test and decided not to take it again. After leaving the test center, I mailed DJ about the score. He motivated me to appear for a reattempt because he believed that I could cross the 720 barrier. I decided to go for it for one final time. It was a big decision and I am glad that I made it.


I shared my ESR with DJ. I received video feedback from him stating some glaring mistakes in quant. He asked me to redo the NP and WP modules and set targets for me in the cementing quizzes. My scores in the quizzes improved after re-doing the modules. After observing the improvement, he sent me a day wise plan for the final fifteen days. I maintained an error log for every question I got incorrect. I used the same to revisit the learnings from every question one day before the exam. I took the last mock a week before the exam and scored 750 (Q49, V42). In the last week, I used the scholaranium to practice questions. The scholaranium provides amazing in-depth analysis of your strengths and weaknesses. I used to revise the summaries of quant modules that I was weak in daily. This time, I did not take a lot of pressure on the exam day as I had scored a decent 690. I went in with no expectations. 


15th December 2021, 3 years, 6 months and three attempts later, was the day I was finally content with my GMAT score as I achieved 730 (Q48, V42) in my exam. I went from Q45 to Q48 in 30 days. It has been a tough journey with many disappointments along the way. There were so many times I thought of giving up but DJ and the people around me did not let me give up. Not once did I feel alone in this journey. DJ, thank you for your amazing and honest mentorship. I know I would not have been able to do this without you.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT prep in August of 2021. I stumbled across an advertisement of e-gmat for a 1-1 consulting with a mentor (Anshul Biserya). I had no idea about e-gmat then. Anshul told me to take an e-gmat mock and then re-connect again with him. I score a 640 (Q48,V29) in that mock. Anshul pointed out that I was lacking conceptual knowledge in CR and SC since inspite of spending more than optimal time. He suggested that I start with concepts of CR and SC. He explained me how to structure my prep for each of the 2 sub section. 
So here is how the e-gmat Modules are structured -
It starts with a master comprehension course. This module is like salt. Doing it won't really  boost your score a lot, but not doing it can expose serious flaws across all three subsections in Verbal. It essentially teaches how to break sentences in to meaningful parts, aiding in extracting meaning of the sentence. This is forms base to solving SC and RC questions and helps to systematically deconstruct CR questions as well. 
I then started with CR module.(for readers - I suggest start with SC) The CR module is quite detailed and teaches right from identifying premise, anti premise, conclusion etc to explaining how gmat introduces incorrect ans choice. So here's an important bit - All subtopics (assumptions, strengthen etc.) start with concept, then have a post assessment quiz and then an entire chapter of 5-6 questions (known as application module) to explain step by step how to approach each question. 
Another very important trick that it teaches is the art of pre-thinking. The idea is very simple - Ask urself what are you looking for in the answer choice. IMHO it doesn't let the answer choice divert your thoughts from the argument and more importantly the authors conclusion and line of thinking. 
Think of it this way - You want to bake a cake - Wouldn't it be easier to know the recipe, identify the ingredients and then go to the store to buy them rather than just directly going the store!!
It took sometime for me to grasp the art of pre-thinking, but it happens. And it's still improving!!! 
The SC module is quite detailed as well. Pretty much covers all the bases. It introduces the meaning based approach. Meaning base approach simply asks us to first understand what the author is trying to communicate via the sentence and then go ahead with the error analysis and answer choice analysis. 
What really stands out is that if you write to e-gmat with ur concerns about gmat prep, they most certainly will respond with a good solution. 
So what happened is after every course i.e. SC, CR etc. I took multiple small quizzes of hard and medium level  (e-gmat calls this cementing quizzes). I was scoring well within 70-80% weighted scores. So I was like yesss!!! finally I know what to do and how to answer correctly with some confidence. So i decided to give a mock (this was in end of September), the same mock I had initially given (I wanted to boost my confidence so decided to re-take the same mock) and guess what! I scored a 630 (Q47 V30)! I was shocked. How did that happen. So shell shocked i wrote to e-gmat team. Archit from e-gmat replied to me with a detailed video about my mock analysis. He mentioned that though i might have understanding of the concepts, i SEVERELY lack application in CR. So he gave me a plan for both CR and SC.  I followed this plan properly. I went through the application files of all CR concepts again over the next few weeks, polished understanding of some of the tricky SC rules for modifiers etc. More importantly i made sure i go through the error log at-least once every 4 days. 
Now come start of November, I gave another 15 question quiz for CR and SC (Hard + Medium). E-gmat calls these quizzes as Ability quiz. It gives a percentile score for the test. I scored an 88th percentile in SC and 92nd percentile in CR. I was happy. I now felt much more confident with SC and CR. For CR i was very sure that i can pre-think in 7/10 cases. So i went ahead and booked my GMAT test for Mid of December.
After scoring decent in the ability tests, I took 2 Sigma-X mock over a period of week (It was end of November by then).  I scored a 650 (Q42, V37) and 700 (Q49,V36). My 700 score was exactly 9 days before my exam date. I was gaining some confidence now.  I kept doing my routine - give quizzes, create error log, revise error log and repeat. 
Then out of now where Dhananjay (DJ) from e-gmat reached out to me 5 days before my gmat date. I was surprised that e-gmat keeps a granular check on who is scoring what! He told me that I could most certainly achieve a high score and that he is willing to help me with my prep over the next few weeks. He told me that e-gmat has a Last Mile Program (LMP)
I will tell you what this is -
Think of a T20 match. For the first 16 overs the team has played well and set up a good base for a strong finish. And then in the last 4 overs go boom bang boom and score a 200+ score.
The last 4 overs is where the LMP comes into play in our GMAT match. The aim is to get those 20-30 points in the finishing lap of the journey. 
However, this plan actually requires 3-4 weeks, but Dhananjay tailored it to my timeline and gave me a 3-4 day plan. We had a session for analysing my my mock. He showed me where my next improvements could come from. He sent me a customised plan too later in the day. I followed the plan to the best possible manner. It did help me boost my SC score. DJ had pointed out in our discussion that i'm taking too long to solve medium level SC questions. So the plan he gave me for SC was helpful. 
I scored a 710 in my actual GMAT (Q47,V39).
The Q47 was slightly disappointing. 
Dhananjay is still working with me for the next jump and hopefully that will come soon.
Till then in E-GMAT style - HAPPY LEARNING!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","1","0","","","January 03, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi T96,

Congratulations on your 710 and I hope you knock it out of the park with your next attempt! (No pun intended)

I enjoyed reading about how you looked at the course. It’s quite a unique viewpoint and deserves an equally unique response. 

Imagine you are in an INDIA vs PAK match, with 20 runs to score in the last over. Now you can do it (because you are Virat Kohli) but you have never done it before and don’t know what it feels like. Enter MS Dhoni :D (A man who is as cool as cucumber under these pressure conditions, and has done it before quite a few times)

The LM Program is LIKE having Dhoni by your side in that last over 😊

Ultimately it comes down to predicting ability and I think showcasing the SC, CR quizzes you took will give others a great visual of what to look for –

																			by score report","Points","Location","When I first decided to prepare for GMAT exam, I wanted to do it strategically from the basics considering that being from a medical background, I've left behind my quant in 10th class only and also I've been from a hindi medium background till my 12th standard. 
To start from the basics, I've researched about so many online course providers of GMAT and the reason why I chose EGMAT was that I liked how they always focus on you mastering the concepts and going deep into the topics not just superficially getting it right anyway.

I would say when I started verbal course, I found master comprehension course to be a blessing for me because that course gave me confidence that I can do well in verbal because I could think or apply strategies in the problems after understanding them.
SC course was specifically good because of its meaning based approach and mainly elimination approach that was really a time saving strategy for me.
CR questions made all the sense to me with prethinking because I was able to connect the dots in the author's reasoning which without prethinking seemed tricky.
RC was a strong point for me after I started comprehending passages well, I not only focused on the meaning but also focused on how author is making transitions through keywords and paragraph by paragraph and this was possible because of the reading strategies I learned through the course.

For Quant course, I would only want to say that the process skills and understanding what process skills are, what process skills you're generally weak at and improving them with the right strategy was everything that worked magically for me. 

The support I've received from egmat was not only limited to the concept courses but I would like to mention the most underrated feature of EGMAT that I feel is its forum. in the forum you can actually find all the answers to your queries about the questions already asked and replied by EGMAT team and whenever you post a new question, you get a reply promptly. I got a chance to interact with nava, anshul, archit, aditee and also Dhananjay and I'm grateful for the whole team for the immense support throughout the journey.

I would like to end my review with a thing I broadly loved about the EGMAT approach is that you don't need any short tips and tricks to ace any exam, you just need to have a right mindset and prepare yourself strategically, identifying and working on every single problem you face and your GMAT success story is not very far away with the right approach.

Although I did do my research before purchasing e-GMAT's online course, my casual approach in preparations would continue for some more time. During this period, however, my understanding of Sentence Correction improved gradually. 
When I started out, Sentence Correction seemed like the only difficult segment for me. But thanks to the detailed study materials and ample test materials available on the e-GMAT platform, I ended up scoring a 99th percentile in my first GMAT attempt. I faltered on things that I always thought I had covered and hence did not put in the requisite effort. The only reason I could score a 99th percentile on the section that should have been my biggest weakness is that I spent almost 70% of my preparation time on this section (both concepts and short tests in Scholaranium). So, if you are willing to put in the necessary effort, e-GMAT will provide you the guidance- things like Meaning-based approach and Strategic pausing proving most helpful for me

The Sigma-X mocks are also a pretty accurate representation of the actual test. 

Talking of guidance, Dhananjay (aka DJ) from the e-GMAT team deserves a special mention as well- he helped me streamline my preparation in the week prior to the test and has continued to support with a detailed analysis of my test performance.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","","","January 05, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Aditya, 
Thank you for the special mention, it warms my heart that you found my advice helpful. Congratulations on the 710 too! 😊

Scoring the 99th percentile on SC is no easy feat and takes three important components –

1)	Understand the meaning and structure of a sentence inside out
2)	Being able to translate that information into actionable information to make decisions on which grammatical errors to weed out
3)	Visualise each answer choice and not fall in common traps

The secret sauce however was the “Pause Points” approach. Most people skip these files, but only the smarter ones stick with them.

The two things that stood out for me were the comprehensiveness of the course and the amazing mentorship of DJ (who I can’t thank enough). Though initially was lazy to go through every module and skipped through some, DJ made me realise that there is no substitute for diligence. I would highly recommend spending a little more building the foundation, it goes along way.

The Sentence Correct course is the bible. It comprehensively covers all the concepts. Pre-thinking is not only absolute mantra to crack CR but it also helps in RC. Going through E-GMAT CR Module engrains the pre thinking in a manner that it becomes a second nature.

Sincere thanks to DJ and the E-GMAT team!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=56#","0","0","","","December 29, 2021","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi BlackWidow28,

Thank you for posting your review and appreciating our engagement. 

I still think you need to verify your 730, but for all purposes when we first spoke about you improving your score from 700 – I know you felt the need to improve your score to a 94th+ percentile given how competitive applications to the top schools were during this year’s application season. 

Thus, we set out on a path to improve your Verbal score whilst you continue to work on your applications. I really appreciate the fact that you took my advice because most high scoring students like doing things their own way and by doing so, I think you understood why you falter on certain CR questions and how to build your ability on SC too. This was visible in your scores in the test readiness phase.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I cannot put into words how thankful I am for enrolling at the e-GMAT. I am now really a fan!

First of all, a quick context: when I took my first mock test, I was completely disappointed by my low score and I thought I would never make it to a 700+ due to not having an Engineering background. I was studying by solving as many questions as I could and was stuck at 600.

And then, I decided to go for e-GMAT. I was presented with a new way of preparing for the GMAT, as the course focuses much more on learning the theory and how to apply the processes than on solving large numbers of questions. And this is the catch!

e-GMAT offers modules for each of the subjects covered in the test and I went at first for SC, which was my weakest spot. I was constantly getting less than 40% of questions right. With the e-GMAY SC course, I learned how to structure my approach to each question in a way that when I proceed to look at the answers, all becomes clear. I learned what I should not do (jump to options or choose the one that sounds better). After going through the whole SC course, I learned the meaning-based approach, which further empowered me in this area, taking my accuracy up to 90% in medium-hard level SC questions. I was stunned.

As I know that my Quant was really weak too, I proceeded to the quant sections of the course. Again, I would have a diagnostic quiz, get -30% of the questions right, go through the modules and do another quiz and get up to 100% right. It really feels like Payal and the other people who explain each subject and question are patiently giving you the tools to kill ANY question while clearing your mind of doubts even before you have the time to fully think about them. 

The personalized study plan, which allows you to input your current score, the hours you will be available per day, and the core you need, completely organizes your study schedule. As an intern in banking with very little free time, this really made a huge difference.

I must also highlight the fantastic tools for self-evaluation. The Sigma-X mocks, which are insanely accurate, helped me pinpoint exactly where I would have more opportunities to improve. The Scholaranium 2.0 has been paramount for the learning process as well with its advanced analytics.

 I forgot to mention but the magic behind the courses is the 3 Stages of Learning approach. At first, learn the theory, then learn how to apply it, and then train your ability to solve questions with the cementing process. By not cutting any corners and following exactly what the course tells us to do, I was really able to improve in a very short time.

I must also mention e-GMAT team's attention and care. Whenever I had any doubt, I would email the support team or post a query in a question and in less than 10 hours I would get an answer (10 hours is no time if you consider that I am in Brazil and the support team is in India.). A special thanks to Dhananjay Lowe for his attention and for helping me through the process, it has been a pleasure to count on him.

And lastly, I would like to say that e-GMAT really thought me subjects that will not be forgotten even after the test itself. The verbal part helped me even with writing my motivation letters, as I would spot mistakes that I was making and that I used to ignore. I really fest that my writing skills improved!

To finish, I would like to thank the whole e-GMAT team! I thank you for helping me go through this at times stressful phase in such a peaceful and fun way. I may sound odd, but I will honestly miss Payal's explanations, the lives during the weekends, and the overall interaction with the team.

For those of you who are undecided about how to study for this test: go for e-GMAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=57#","13","0","","","December 22, 2021","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey GuiCeitlin,

Thank you so much for being a fan and a wonderful brand ambassador but we are as grateful to you for being such a wonderful student. Your journey from a 610 has been so inspiring for a multitude of reasons. I would like to take up this space to talk about your mini-wins 😊

Mini-Win 1 – Accepting the flaw in your SC approach and committing to strategic review and the cementing process

Your Confession: https://success.e-gmat.com/Student-Confession

Your Scores post re-work: https://success.e-gmat.com/SC-Cementing-Chart-G

You decided to postpone your test by a month to ensure you could do the course in the right way. That was a very wise and courageous thing to do at that point. 

Mini-Win 2 – Doing the Quant course deliberately but using the Quant 2.0 course architecture you saved over 8 hours. 

Taking the diagnostic quizzes gives you an edge since it allows the course to pick and choose what you should and should not do. 

ALG P.A.C.E. Time Savings: https://success.e-gmat.com/PACE-ALG-Time-Savings

I really appreciate that you wrote about an important pillar of our course – the support system we have built-in place. We cater to all times zones (including BRT) by ensuring that we have teams working 24*7 and all days of the year. It’s one of the hardest and most under-appreciated jobs but when students like you mention it, it makes all our effort worthwhile. 

We will back to you till the end and beyond, you know that right? 

Once an e-GMATer, always an e-GMATer. 

PS – All the best for your next attempt! I know you can score a 720+

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT preparation in June 2021. Before beginning my preparation, I was in doubt about subscribing to any online course for GMAT because being an engineer, I was good enough in Quant and only needed more self practice, and being an ICSE student in 10th standard and pretty good in English, I thought any online course can’t teach me anything extra and only practicing more questions is what is going to get me through. So I bought the GMAT Official Guide 2022 and practiced each and every question, even revised my mistakes and revisited every wrong question. When I had completed the OG 22, I thought of appearing the first two official tests from mba.com. Scored pretty well in both with a 680 and 700 and gained more confidence. So I planned on appearing all the tests from the online test series of Manhattan and practiced questions side by side from GMAT Club from topics on which I committed most of the mistakes. I also had some study material for verbal from which I studied selected topics which I was not good at. As usual Quant section of the test series was very tough and the panicked me started emphasizing more on Quant and less on Verbal. Also, scores in verbal were okay (V 33- 34). 
When I saw that I had gained much confidence, I appeared for the GMAT in October 2021. Scored a 650 with Q50 and a V28! Could not believe the score. Thought how on Earth could I go so wrong in Verbal ! Back that evening when I sat back and pondered on my preparation, I realized I had only gone through and understood the study material for verbal but I never learnt how to apply that learnt knowledge in avoiding mistakes. So then I decided to appear for the GMAT once again, now with proper coaching in verbal. At that time, E-gmat came to my rescue. The questions I was asked in my consultation call were whether I got confused with the final two answer choices after applying process of elimination, also whether I understood the meaning before moving to the answer choices. My answers to the questions were yes and no respectively. I realized those were my real problems. As I had only one month more at hand before the application deadlines I was offered a one-month E-GMAT course and immediately a mentor was assigned to me. I would say DJ was very patient with me and understanding, guiding me at every step and telling me what next to do. Also, the course and its modules were very informative. By going through the meaning-based approach and first finding errors in the original sentence and then moving to the answer choices, I started to actually feel that I was improving in sentence correction. Also, pre-thinking in critical reasoning and summarizing in reading comprehension were the tools that reduced my time taken on each question. Also, the emphasis on maintaining an error log really helped me focus on my mistakes. The study plan was extensive but by studying diligently I started getting more and more confident in verbal. After completing the module, I appeared again for the GMAT and this time I could score a 690 with a verbal improvement to V34. 
With this, I realized that only knowing stuff is not important. Having a proper strategy and the right approach to solve the questions in the GMAT pattern is equally important.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=57#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","","Location","I was unsure about signing up for a GMAT prep course for a very long time and spent a considerable amount of time preparing for the test before signing up. I completed the OG (twice) and took every mock available on the internet but my scores were extremely inconsistent. While there was a definite sense of slow improvement, my mock scores ranged from as low as 670 to as high as 740 and I couldn’t be sure exactly what I could reasonably expect on test day. I also felt like I couldn’t confidently assess and pinpoint my weaknesses to target them and secure my target score and so I decided that the best course of action was to sign up for an online GMAT course to provide some structure to my preparation. 

During this time, I found E-GMAT through their YouTube channel where they upload weekly webinars which are conducted free of cost so I decided to go ahead and attend a few. These webinars were what convinced me to sign up for this course as their primary focus was on mastering concepts and establishing processes. This approach resonated with me because I felt that I would be able to bridge the gaps in my conceptual understanding of certain topics while identifying my weaknesses. 

The Quant course is extremely through and focuses on establishing a solid conceptual foundation and then the process skills required to solve problems and how to apply them to solve even the hardest questions on the GMAT. This focus on improving my process skills and maintaining an error long were instrumental in improving my quant score as I was able to identify exactly where I tended to make mistakes and ensure I didn’t repeat them. 
E-GMAT’s quant question bank is very comprehensive and difficulty level of the questions is higher than those in the official guide or GMAT prep. Solving these harder questions in under 2 minutes is essential in doing well on test day and really tests the depth of your conceptual understanding.

The Verbal Course is very good and builds right from the basics covers every area tested by GMAT in SC, RC and CR. In CR particularly, the pre-thinking strategy taught in the course helped me save a lot of time. Before using pre-thinking, I used to barely be able to complete the verbal section in the mocks and after learning it, I felt like I was able to not only complete the section comfortably but also answer questions with much more confidence.

 Additionally, While GMAT Prep mocks give a very good idea about what we can expect from the actual exam we cannot analyze our performance and how we can improve. The Sigma-X mocks (by E-GMAT) are extremely detailed in this regard. As someone who has taken pretty much every free mock available, I can confidently say that the Sigma-X mocks are by far the most comprehensive in their assessment and will expose any weaknesses that you have.

Finally, the personalized support I was provided whilst taking the course was tremendous. The e-GMAT team was always accessible through email and were extremely prompt and detailed in their responses. I was lucky enough to be offered a spot in their Last Mile Program where they provide you a mentor in the last few weeks of preparation to really push you to achieve your target score and I believe these last few weeks were the most significant and focused because of the direction my mentor provided. 

My mentor Atreya helped me identify specific weak points in particular concepts in verbal and provided me with a personalized plan of attack including personalized ppts, videos and quizzes. He also helped analyze my mock performances and really made me understand the importance of timing and maintaining pace during the test. He shared a timing matrix and instructed me on how to create specific quizzes on the platform to familiarize myself with it and get test ready. 

As someone with a fairly hectic full-time job, my only expectation from a prep course was that I would identify my weak points and improve on them. The E-GMAT course went above and beyond this expectation with the amount of support and personalized insight I received and the detailed timing and performance analytics for each sub section and topic on the platform.

 In summary, I believe that the E-GMAT course is the complete package that can provide you with everything you need to achieve your target score!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=57#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Great Accuracy in Medium and Hard questions: You maintained very good accuracies in medium and hard questions and have only solved 450 questions to reach there (Check Screenshot #1): this was possible because you reviewed your mistakes and kept working on them till you mastered.  

Good Test Readiness scores: You have been consistent in your Test readiness quizzes in both Verbal and Quant (Check Screenshot #2). This made you ready for the mocks and then the test.

The e-GMAT course is phenomenal. The structured and comprehensive curriculum, the question banks and analytics platform are really exceptional. My favorite is scholaranium, which has amazing analysis on your strengths and weaknesses.

I took all the verbal courses in a very short period and I wish that I could take it much earlier in my prep journey. I realized that my prep was not optimal yet at that time, but I decided to go ahead for my first GMAT attempt.  As a result, I got below expectation score of 670 (Q49 V31).

1 week post the exam, the e-GMAT team reached out and offered me a seat in the 'Last Mile Program' - a mentor-guided program to prepare your next GMAT exam within 15-60 days.

DJ is the mentor assigned to me and he is very great and super helpful. He analyzed my ESR and came up with targeted plan for the next few weeks, focusing on SC and CR. He shared weekly milestones on SC and CR, pointing out targeted courses that I need to retake - the most important ones are the master comprehension and meaning based approach for SC. He also highlighted to me the importance of error log (using e-GMAT structured error log template) - I was skeptical earlier, but after few tries, I realized that it was very helpful in really going deep to understand areas, skill-sets or processes that I faltered.

During my last 2-3 weeks prior to the test, DJ guided me to do Quant Test Readiness and the last mile plan. It was very targeted to refresh and further sharpen my quant skills. The last mile plan was helpful in building my test readiness skills as well as my confidence.

I took my next GMAT attempt on early December and scored 710 (Q50 V35).

Your SC ability plagued you at this point and it was the one thing standing in your way of scoring better on Verbal.

The diligence with which you went through the Master Comprehension course that contain hour-long sessions with Payal showed me that you wanted to change this.

Your hard work finally paid off when you took cementing quizzes and comfortably crossed the benchmark.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Before starting the course on eGmat, I already completed a few GMAT courses from other reputed providers, but none of their approaches were well suited for my style, and despite putting up a lot of effort towards my GMAT, I could not improve my score and cross the 700 marks. After wasting three valuable attempts and a lot of money I came across eGMAT, which has excessively positive reviews for eGMAT on Gmat Club. I was skeptical at first but decided to join their free trial anyways and to my surprise, it was very thorough and teaches methods that can be used in a wide variety of questions and not just does the trick a few times and fail for the rest of the questions. Impressed by the trial, I enrolled for the full course.

My primary focus was English, where I was seriously lacking, and eGMAT delivered on the promise. When you go through the first few exercises, where they teach you how to read with pauses and introduce you to nouns and pronouns, they seem slow and nowhere near GMAT level at first but the course gradually develops your fundamental skills and prepares you for the harder questions ahead. Yes, their approach, of understanding the purpose of each part and then deducing the error in the sentence, may seem a bit slow at first because it is much faster to do a 2-3 split using some keywords and go for the answer, but as you approach harder questions this approach is your trump card.  When you thoroughly understand the question, you don’t make silly mistakes and you’re more confident about the choices you mark. I can probably pinpoint a lot of things that I liked about the course, but all those are meaningless because the best thing about any GMAT prep course is that you can experience it yourself before enrolling and spending even a dime. Check out the free trial and you’ll see the difference yourself.

I still remember a quote from the founder Rajat in one of his webinars, “A lot of people say GMAT is a test of timing/time management, It is not. If you can’t solve all the questions in time, don’t. Attempt the first 27 questions correctly and mark the rest of them randomly. I guarantee you will get a score of above 700”. I made this my mantra for GMAT and, no surprises here, he was definitely right.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=57#","13","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

This is where e-GMAT comes in. The first step after signing in was to take a Sigma-X mock and create a ""Personalised Study Plan"" using the outcome of the mock. The PSP helped me structure my preparation and create a solid timeline toward my second attempt.

SC on e-GMAT was a game changer. The meaning based approach made the task of reading the question statement and all the options way easier. The grammar sections were useful in helping me revise English grammar.

CR and RC on e-GMAT introduced unique concepts that helped simplify the process of solving these questions. ""Pre-thinking"" is one of those concepts that helped my increase my accuracy in CR.

The quant package in e-GMAT is an ever evolving part of the course with Quest 2.0 suggesting the necessary steps to take in order to make the required improvements.

Scholaranium ties the whole course together and brings the most impact in boosting your score in the GMAT. Scholaranium helps cementing the concepts learnt in the video lessons. It's customisable and flexible quizzes with its in-depth insights is what sets it apart from anything else.

The course structure helped me to clear the fundamentals and follow the meaning based approach which actually worked quite in my favor. Also the 3 step process designed by Egmat is quite a reliable tool for people who are not much experienced with grammar rules. 
For QA, the best part is the course begins everything from scratch, which is helpful for people coming from non quantitative background.

Congratulations on the 750 score! We are glad to be a part of your journey to this fantastic score. You had a score of 600 on the first mock that you took on our platform and to improve from there to 750 (a 150-point improvement) is just fabulous. 

I am glad that you internalized the 3-step process & the meaning-based approach which in-turn helped you on SC. Your diligence in imbibing the process and approach can be seen in how you have attempted the Verbs module.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Back in 2018, I scored just a 580 on the GMAT. I was so distraught with the whole process that I almost gave up only to come back in 2021 to give it a try once more and start preparing for GMAT again. I started preparing back in Jan 2021 and solved all the OG questions and when it was time to give my mocks, I observed that my score was not levelling above 640-650 in all Manhattan and VERITAS mocks. That is when I reached out to e-GMAT folks in May to get the help I needed to improve my Verbal score. I had opted for just the Verbal online course from e-GMAT for which I had read a zillion reviews online of how intensive and thorough the course is.

I believed that my Quant was strong enough for me to score a Q49+ and that reflected in my prep and all the mocks too. I never scored below a Q48 in Quant, but to my dismay not sure what really happened on the test day that I just scored a Q44 even though I felt it had went well. 

Verbal: The Verbal course was really thorough starting from the Master Comprehension module which makes you acquainted with how to read and comprehend really long sentences by taking appropriate pause points. This will help test takers in tackling both the lengthy SC questions as well as making sense of the CR and RC questions.
Although I was doing well in the OG questions and getting questions correct, I didn't know if I am getting a question right for right reasons and why are all the other 4 choices incorrect.
This is where e-GMAT's famous process proves to be utter useful. They have a very well-defined process for all the three sections in Verbal. For SC, they helped me inculcate meaning based approach which worked wonders for me to push those verbal barriers. It was an eye opener for me to realise how blindly I used to approach SC questions earlier. Similarly for CR, pre-thinking helped me get to that right answer pretty quickly. Although I felt it to be cumbersome and time consuming earlier, I realised its value soon enough and started using it while attempting CR questions. I personally was struggling a lot with RC more than any other section and personalised feedback videos from Harsha and my mentor DJ really helped me ace it. Like I never gave up on the journey and stuck o the process, neither did the entire e-GMAT team gave up on me. I could just send an email to the team and they would get back within 24 hours by hook or crook. 

Their error log templates tailor made for SC and CR helped me pin point on the exact mistakes I used to make and eventually you do find a pattern of the mistakes you commit. Very importantly, the biggest help in e-GMAT was the question bank (Scholaranium 2.0) and the explanations. It is such an awesome tool with a plethora of questions to practice. each question had a clear solution with details of how to approach a question. And for the few questions where the explanations weren't understandable or thorough, I could just go to the ask an expert section where other test takers like me would have asked a similar doubt and the verbal experts would have clarified the doubts.

Lastly, I cannot finish my review without giving a special shout out to my mentor DJ. The kind of mentoring he provided and the way he was always brutally honest with me during the entire journey of prep was unparalleled. He was always very encouraging and pushed me in the right direction to get to this score in Verbal which I could have only dreamed of earlier. And when I was almost there and just needed a slightly harder push, he enrolled me to the Last Mile Push program wherein he just made me focus on my improvement areas and refine and finesse my verbal skills. The Last mile program made me believe in myself even more and got me to that score of V41.
I will always be immensely thankful to DJ and the entire team of e-GMAT.

GMAT journey is a very exhausting journey and takes a toll on you at times. It may not be easy to start with but eventually will lead to success. And the team sitting right here is extremely supportive and will guide you in the right direction. Personally, I would say that had I taken the course slightly earlier, my prep time would have been reduced by more than half. This is indeed a ONE STOP SOLUTION for acing the GMAT !","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=57#","0","0","","","","","",""

The overall material is good, with nice explanations and exercises. However, i think the material is good to help you arrive to the 700 milestone. Still, it is not sufficient if you plan to score a higher score like top 5 % as it lacks the tips and tricks to do that. Some of these tricks, especially in Quant, were included in the Gmat club forums but not in the preparation material. Moreover, the Verbal section might be a little bit biased as my real verbal score was below all the mocks i took.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT Prep in June 2021, and was keen on joining a coaching institute that would teach in a live and interactive manner. I ended up joining another apparently ""well-known"" coaching institute and wasted 4 months (Jun-Sep) and 40K for a 3-month seemingly live course, only to realise that neither my doubts were getting cleared, nor was I getting any proper guidance (faculty was rude every time I'd ask a doubt in the live classes). All they taught were short cuts and tricks that never worked for me. In October 2019, when I took my first attempt at GMAT, I scored a mere 630 which wouldn't get me anywhere. (Please note, I got a 730 in GMAT Practice test 4 just one day before the test; I found out that the famous coaching institute had used some of the quant questions and RC passages from official mock questions in classroom teaching and perhaps hence my scores were inflated). After my GMAT, I contacted my previous coaching institute faculty seeking further guidance, only to get ghosted (faculty wouldn't respond even after I tried calling them 3-4 times). Frustrated, I rigorously searched online and came across e-gmat and after reading verified reviews and reading free eGMAT topics, set up a call with Sundeep on October 5 and explained him my situation. I had already missed R1 and desperately wanted to apply in R2. Sundeep guided me, explaining exactly how many hours I needed to put in, over the next 2 months. I immediately bought the 2 month online focussed course and started my prep. I started with SC, which was my weakest section (scored a mere 50th percentile in the first sigmaX mock). After going through most of the topic videos, taking all the cementing quizzes, and 1 ability quiz, my SC score touched 97th percentile in the second sigmaX mock. The meaning based approach was really the key! I knew most of the basic concepts (basically had the key ingredients), but did not know how to apply them without judging the correct intended meaning. Once SC became my strength, CR and RC had to be worked upon. I watched all the CR videos (at this point I hadn't touched RC) and took a few cementing quizzes. I must work more on RC and CR to score more than a V35. 
eGMAT course aims to build the ability to solve questions, rather than just providing useless tricks that do not always work. Quant has been my strong area, as I am from an engineering background; however, the courses have helped me fill the gaps and reach a Q50. 
I took another GMAT on 30th November and scored a 700 (Q50,V35). After that, I reached out to the team and was immediately responded back by Dhananjay. I'm now looking forward to his guidance to help me improve my scores (hopefully by December end) and I place my full trust on eGMAT and the faculty. 
(Another positive point of this course is that your doubts get cleared immediately with the help of respective discussion threads, so you don't have to deal with unresponsive / rude faculty. At the end of the day, one must get the value for their hard earned money and eGMAT is worth every penny!)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=58#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Thank you for posting your review and I am glad you find e-GMAT “really good”!

I am sorry to hear about your experience with the coaching institute, but this is the precise problem we are looking to solve with the e-GMAT Course –

1)	Solving doubts real time and making sure we pre-empt the doubts you have: We have the Forums feature built into the product. I would suggest you use this as much as you can.
2)	Proper Guidance: I know you are working with me in the LM program – because even with a good product we need to ensure you are getting the right advice at the right time.
3)	The Complete Lack of Shortcuts and Tricks – we are the one course that you will find that advises strictly against it, only for the simple reason that tips and tricks work in an exam that is repeatable but not an adaptive test. This is probably a clear discussion point over the call e had too.
Sundeep is one of our most venerated strategy consultants and I am glad that you got the opportunity to speak with him. However, your diligence comes out in what you said -

“eGMAT course aims to build the ability to solve questions, rather than just providing useless tricks that do not always work. Quant has been my strong area, as I am from an engineering background; however, the courses have helped me fill the gaps and reach a Q50.”

Quant: I have always been strong in Quant and got a Q50 in most of my practice tests, but ended up scoring only Q47 and Q48 in the actual test. E-Gmat really helped bridge those gaps in a few concepts that stopped me from scoring a Q50. Each practice test and session was followed by a thorough review and a ""going back to the basic concepts"" kind of approach which really helped hone my quant skills to secure a Q50.  

Verbal: The Verbal course was also really thorough. I almost had to start from scratch and redefine my whole approach in CR and RC and E-Gmat helped do this. 

The biggest help in E-Gmat was the question bank and the explanations. Each question had a clear solution with details of how to approach a question. But for the few questions where the explanations weren't understandable or thorough, I could just send an email to the team and they would get back within 24 hours.

Lastly, I cannot finish my review without mentioning the mentoring that Aditee Biyani provided. She was always very encouraging and pushed me in the right direction to get to this score.
I'll always be thankful to E-Gmat.

Final words: 
I cannot help but mention the fact that I did feel lonely in this journey many times and lost motivation to study. GMAT is a journey and you can only choose your vehicle but you have to do the driving. Looking back on my journey now, I cannot help but wish I drove harder and pushed above that 740+ score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=58#","0","0","","","December 20, 2021","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi mpk777,

One thing that comes to mind when I reminisce your journey is that your ESR had shown weakness in DS and that was one of the first things we worked on in Quant. Your efforts in Quant and DS showed results and are a proof that working systematically and with reliable processes delivers results.

																			by post count","","Location","I am a hard believer of outsourcing things, because if you have experts in the market who can provide products with 10X quality and in 1/10th of your time, it make sense to buy the product (if it's affordable to you), rather than labouring yourself. When I appeared for my first mock test on MBA.com and scored 620, I very well understood that I need to get some GMAT course, which can help me fairly improve my score. Then came the question of which product to buy, and so, I did an extensive research by attending webinars, taking demo classes, talking to peers and senior and also reading reviews and feedback on online platforms, and through this I came to know that egmat is the answer to my quest 

As soon as I got my login credentials to egmat, I was really happy to see that egmat helps you prepare a detailed timeline of how your preparation should go for a particular score improvement that you are looking at. And trust me, planning is important, as 'failing to plan, is planning to fail'. I spend a day at planning my course with the help of egmat, and ensured that I made a holistic and flexible plan, which is executable by humans.

I started my preparation and delved directly into the SC portion of the Verbal module (this was my weakest zone and I wanted to face my fear first). The course of egmat is so well structured and scientifically designed that it will hand-hold you right from understanding the basics of a concept to solving 750 level questions. The whole egmat course is so designed that you first have a pre quiz, then the actual concept and finally the post quiz. The post quiz checks how well you have understood the concept and if there are still any gaps, you are asked to revise the concept. So, egmat does not allow you any escape gates, and you leave one concept, only when you have cemented the fundamentals of it. The step wise step guide which you are taught to solve a verbal question is foolproof and as you practice more and more questions in the Scholaranium, you will start seeing a massive increase in your pace.

I also had certain gaps in my quants section, specially the data insufficiency questions and wanted to fill those gaps surgically. I quickly steered through all the concepts in quants and delved into the Scholaranium for practising questions. And trust me on this, Scholaranium is the Bible for you. You don't need any other material, if you have practised all the questions in Scholaranium. The Scholaranium 2.0 is designed to incorporate all the OG questions as well as gives you the flexibility to chose the type of questions you want to pratice, so that the gaps can be plugged surgically, and you don't waste a lot of time unnecessarily.

Finally, just before the D-Day, I just revised the summary PDFs which I got at the end of every concept and then I was exam ready. So, if your concepts are cemented and you have practised a substantial number of questions, you can ace the GMAT exam without feeling the pressure in the centre. This is how egmat helped me and I wanted you guys to know that it was bang for my buck.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=58#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT prep journey has not been a simple journey of progress. It was a lot longer than I had expected it to be. Preparing for verbal was the biggest hurdle for me to achieve a good GMAT score. 

In Sep-20, I started preparing for GMAT by solving OG questions (Yes, it was the first big mistake I made). One month after, I took e-GMAT free Sigma-X Mock test to gauge my level and scored 660. I really liked the quality of questions and the free content so decided to subscribe to their course but only purchased their verbal course instead of the entire course (the second big mistake as I didn't get any sigma mock tests with it to gauge my level before attempting GMAT). For the next 2 months, I went through the entire course and attempted most of the Scholoranium questions. Finally, took my GMAT in Jan-21 and scored 680. Disappointed with my performance, I stopped my preparation for a couple of months (the third big mistake). 

In May-21, I regained my confidence and started preparing for GMAT again. Now here comes the fourth big mistake which was the biggest among all.  I thought that I had already gone through the e-GMAT course so now it’s time for self-study and solving a lot of questions would help me break that 700 barrier. Following this strategy relentlessly for 4 months, I took my GMAT again in Sep-21 only to score a disheartening 660 (V29).  

The very next day I emailed the e-GMAT support team and asked for help (the first right thing I did). Now comes the good part of the journey. To my surprise, we exchanged a lot of emails on weekend. DJ asked me for ESR and analyzed it for me. He shared with me a high-level plan.

Since I had already gone through the course, the plan had to be personalized for me. DJ along with verbal experts created one for me. I first went through the new MC course along with the webinars conducted by Payal, which were an eye-opener for me. Following the pausing strategy, my approach to look at complex sentences changed. This helped me in all sections- SC, CR, and RC. We then moved to SC. DJ inculcated in me the meaning-based approach and made sure that I follow it while solving questions. He asked me to look at the incorrect attempted questions, create error logs and solve correct attempted questions by following the meaning-based approach. We followed a similar plan to instill Pre-thinking approach for CR. He also asked me to do Revision-B for all sections to brush up on all concepts. After passing the cementing quizzes, DJ then introduced me to the test readiness stage. I believe this is the most important stage to break that 700 barrier. Scholaranium is a great platform to successfully complete this stage. The different types of quizzes, detailed explanations, xPert suggested strategic review process, and the level of data insights takes the experience to another level. Following the strategic review process, I attempted the Sigma-X mocks one by one. The mocks proved to be quite accurate and similar to the real GMAT exam. After these intense exercises, DJ was convinced that I am ready to take the exam. Finally, he shared with me the tasks for the week before GMAT. I took the exam and finally scored 710. 

I believe that it is the real day pressure and anxiety which can affect one’s score by 10-20 points. Nonetheless, I could finally cross that 700 barrier. All thanks to DJ and the entire team for making this possible for me! 

I would suggest everyone to follow a methodological approach if you’re not able to improve (instead of solving a lot of questions) and trust the e-GMAT process and diligently follow it. It may not be easy for everyone but eventually, it will lead to success. Also, do not hesitate to get in touch with the team even if the process is not working out for you. The entire team is very supportive. They will help you understand what’s going wrong and will guide you in the right direction. I wish I did not have to learn it the hard way. Do not give up. All the best!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=58#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I decided to opt for a course in mid September 2021 because I realised while solving problems that my Verbal abilities needed some significant improvement. Based on GMATClub reviews, I decided to go for e-GMAT.
Their Verbal Section(Sentence Correction modules in particular) are really good. Initially when I started out, SC was my weakest area but eventually, it became one of my strongest sections in Verbal. By following the step-by-step e-GMAT process, I could effortlessly answer some of the hard SC questions.
In CR, the process of pre-thinking and breaking down the argument into fundamentals(premises and conclusions) boosted my thought process clarity and in RC, the notes on summarising paragraphs proved out to be beneficial as well.
In Quant, the hard questions in Scholaranium really test out your concepts and if someone is able to nail those, I feel he can answer just about any GMAT quant question.
The 'Skill data' feature of Scholaranium is pretty amazing as it helped me analyse my strengths and weaknesses by quantifying by abilities across each sub-topic.
I also felt that the Sigma-X mock tests are pretty good estimators of your actual ability. It's a bit on the tougher side but better have a cushion that inflate your actual level.
Finally, I think the game changer for me was the personal guidance in the LMT programme that I received from Dhananjay(DJ). I reached out to him a bit worried, one week before the test. He organised a call with me, where we discussed the areas where I was lacking and created a tailor-made plan specifically for me to follow in the last week. That really helped me a lot as I got to work on my weaknesses and give my prep that final finishing touch.

Getting a 730 is an accomplishment very few people can talk about, welcome to a very elite success club. Your story is particularly inspiring for 2 reasons –

Reason 1 - I love your success because it is powered by your tenacity and your willingness to act on recommendations. You were not deterred by the 680 attempts, 5 days before the test. Rather, you wanted to fix the causes. We identified that stamina issues (Quant, see screenshot) and specific weaknesses in inference questions as areas of improvement (screenshot). You fixed both issues and the rest is history (Q50, V38) :)

Stamina Issues: https://success.e-gmat.com/Quant-Stamina

Verbal Issues: https://success.e-gmat.com/Inference-Issues

Reason 2 - You improved your SC Ability from the 54th percentile to the 80th Percentile + in a matter of 2 months.  Your concept and practice quiz scores (both close to 90%) show that you were destined for success right from the get-go and that you truly imbibed the meaning-based approach. We love students who are as diligent as you are.

SC Stats: https://success.e-gmat.com/SC-Scores

However, the journey is not over. I am glad that you are working with me to improve this to a 99th percentile score and I wish you all the best for this second leg!

"December 04, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","A long and not so smooth journey to 730","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my rather long journey of GMAT studies in August 2020. At first, I took a course from another test prep company. In December 2020, I took my first attempt and scored 640. After that, I came across E-gmat. My friends had also recommended me this course. I scheduled a consultation call with them and I bought the Verbal and Quant package. Fast forward to November 2021, I took the test again and I scored a 730 (V41,Q49). 

When I started preparing from E-GMAT, I had to unlearn some concepts, especially in Verbal, and learn some new tricks in Quants. E-GMAT course is very intensive but at the same time, it helps you have that strong concept base. What made E-GMAT stand out for me was the course structure , the practice questions , and a clear path forward.

Highlights about Verbal course :

The Verbal course is just phenomenal. It covers all the concepts that you need to know in the GMAT exam. It is structured in a very coherent manner and it is very easy to follow from one sub module to another. The course starts with the Master Comprehension course which gives us essential reading strategies which make our life so much easier !

Sentence Correction module was a very helpful module. The concepts taught as a part of this course didn't seem like rocket science, this was because the course is very student friendly and easy to follow through. Especially the Meaning based approach taught in Sentence Correction module is the only way I feel that one should approach this question type. I have honestly tried using other methods like elimination. But, from what I have observed and applied in the actual test , only the Meaning based approach works ! And it works absolutely flawlessly. 

The Critical Reasoning course was an eye opener for me personally because having taken the GMAT once before , I never knew the step by step approach that one needs to follow to solve the CR questions. Before the E-GMAT course , I used to jump into the CR section without having any strategy or framework in my mind. The E-GMAT CR course teaches the very Step by Step process which is needed for getting a high accuracy on the CR questions. The Prethinking approach is the most helpful takeaway from the entire section. As it is taught in the course , we must fight the urge to jump straight into option choices before analysing the argument. I cannot emphasize enough on importance of following the step-by-step approach! It is just that great :)

The Reading Comprehension section was especially helpful for me since I was not an avid reader and had never read so many fact-heavy and inference-heavy passages in my life before. The key reading strategies, if followed to the details, will help you to reduce the reading time and at the same time will increase your comprehension ability exponentially. 

To conclude, If I had realized it sooner that the methodologies and the step-by-step approach taught be E-GMAT is the only way forward, I would have cut my preparation time in half. But as it is said, better late than never! Honestly, the day I realized that if I apply the process skills taught to me during the  course exactly as they have been taught to me , my time management problems disappeared and my accuracy started improving.

Highlights about the Quant 2.0 course:

This course is genuinely the only thing you need for GMAT Quant. There is absolutely no reason to refer to other sources once you have taken this course and have seriously gone through the course. The Quant 2.0 module is a module in which you can adapt the course as per your expertise. The course gives personalized feedbacks along the way, which I think was the most important part of my preparation. The GMATSkills files and Practice Files covered all the tricky ways in which the questions could be phrased. 

Mid August 2021 , I was also selected for the Last Mile Program(LMP) . I was assigned a mentor to guide me through till my target score. Mr Atreya Roy was my mentor and he guided me at every step. He also provided me personalized feedback and gave me a list of actionable steps. He also analysed my mocks and provided me a video mentioning the entire analysis and the areas of improvement. He also shared detailed plan of improvement. He was my point of contact for the entire 3 months and he helped me with any queries I had during this time :) I would say LMP is a really nice initiative to help students get where they wish to be!!

Finally , I would like to say that the team of experts at E-GMAT is extremely helpful and they respond to any queries that you may have in the least time possible. Each question in E-GMAT has a separate discussion thread and most of my questions were already answered ! Even If I  didn't  have any query , just going through the discussions gave me so much more insights into different ways of solving the problems.

The SIGMAX  mocks are really close to the actual GMAT. The quality of verbal and quant questions are very similar to the quality of questions in the actual test. The Quant questions specifically are very close in terms of concepts tested and the difficulty level. For me , the test taking experience was rather smooth because I had already taken the SIGMAX mocks and I didn't feel that the actual test was a whole different game. Overall , the feedback provided after every mock was very informative and it guided me towards the next steps.

I would say that had I taken the e-gmat course earlier , my prep time would have been reduced by more than half. This is a one stop solution for the GMAT !!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=58#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I had been wanting to give the GMAT since a few years and finally started my preparation post pandemic year of 2020. Like every other aspirant, I took the official guides as my source of truth and started to understand more about the exam, the sections and what are the types of questions there are. 

With the initial learnings and basic ideas into the paper, I took the leap of faith to give a diagnostic test and scored a 600. This made me sure that I had to dig deeper into the concepts of both the Verbal and Quant sections if I need to have a serious chance of cracking the GMAT. That is when I started to research about various GMAT online programs that I can avail to re-run all the concepts and build expertise around the sections. With detailed research and a free counselling session by E-GMAT folks, I enrolled into E-gmat during April 2021 to now dedicatedly focus on my preparation.

What makes E-GMAT stand out?
The entire syllabus of the GMAT exam is intricately broken down in the E-GMAT platform, with each section having sequential learnings transpiring from initial concept to application and then trickling down to increased ability and expertise. Both sections for Verbal and Quant have detailed video learnings for each topic and sub-topic, along with pre and post assessment quizzes to re-impose the concept. 

Enhancing these video learnings into actual problems from each difficulty was imposed perfectly by the Scholaranium 2.0 platform, which gave detailed insights into your quiz attempts as well as provides data points to identify areas of strengths and weakness. Rigorous effort put into SC, CR and Quant section from my end helped me understand my concepts better and build a solid base for my GMAT exam. 

Another factor that gave me good exam practice and confidence were the Sigma X mocks, in which I transitioned from the diagnostic score of 600 to a 720 with the improved learnings and concepts learnt over a span of 2 months. The mocks are very close to the actual GMAT exam and provide you the right opportunities to apply your skills and manage time in a simulated exam-type experience. The 5 mocks given in my course helped me identify my strengths and weaknesses and revise and redo concepts accordingly for my main exam.

The Last Mile Program (LMP)
With the score improvement to 720 in my mocks, I got an opportunity to work with E-GMAT Mentor team (Aditee), who looked at all the data that is present in my E-GMAT portal and guided me to have a dedicated approach to reach my target score and help ace the GMAT in the official attempt as well. Aditee introduced me to the concepts of strategically logging my errors in error-logs which massively helped me to revisit my errors and ensure that I try not repeating the same in any of my future questions!
The team also guided me improve my score from a 680 (first attempt with a CR dip) and help bring my verbal score from a V32 to V40 with guided improvements in CR to finally help me get my target score of 720.

I would strongly recommend the E-GMAT course to all students who want to focus on the detailed concepts provided by the amazing online platform and wants to practice GMAT questions across with Scholaranium and Sigma X Mocks for a complete GMAT experience.

Thank you for being a part of the eGMAT family. Congratulations on your 720. 

On reflecting back this is not just a 40-point improvement but a 120-point improvement from 600 to 720! Your journey was a roller-coaster ride. There were several highs and lows and there were 2 things that ensured this success: 

Diligence – You took feedback from the system every time your score was not where we wanted it to be and improved. If the system showed that you were weak in a particular concept, you did not shy away from revising it multiple times till you understood it well. Not just that you never got complacent with good scores. 

              Course Diligence : https://success.e-gmat.com/CR-Course-Diligence

Belief in yourself and the course – Even when your mock score took a hit you continued to believe that you can make it to the 700 club and that e-GMAT is going to be the partner for that journey. Your course and Scholaranium data were there to reinforce that you had the potential to do well.

																			by post count","Points","Location","I gave GMAT last year in December and got a score of 660. I had gone through 4 months of self-study using manhattan books, CR bible, GMAT club Youtube videos, and GMATNinja Youtube Videos and also 1 and a half months of E-GMAT verbal course towards the end of my prep. I was targetting a score of 700+ and 660 really disappointed me and I realized I will have to try again next year and also that I should have taken the E-GMAT verbal course earlier, opposite to what I did last time.

So, I began my preparation for GMAT again in May, after taking some break. This time I contacted the E-GMAT team through the mail in the beginning and told them my whole story and what I was expecting from them and from myself. They were very active to reply to the emails. The 1 and a half month course that I had done last year made me realize how much I can improve if I gave this course sufficient time and practice as the content is really very good in there. It is so interactive and also if I wanted any help, I used to drop a mail to the support team. The mail thread had around 50 mails by the time I gave my GMAT. They helped me plan my study schedule, and the way by which I can cement the concepts as just going through the study materials is never enough. My accuracy and way of thinking or I should say Pre-Thinking significantly improved by going through the E-GMAT verbal course. There are so many questions to practice and the forum discussions for each question are a great help.

After using the course for around 5-6 months I finally got a score of 710, and I am really satisfied with this.
I would like to thank the entire team of E-GMAT for helping me throughout this process.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Before signing up for eGMAT, I tried studying for 2 weeks from a book I borrowed from a buddy. Although the book did give me a preview of the types of questions, I wasn't able to grasp the techniques mentioned and apply them. The lack of interactivity and structured feedback got to me. So, I looked for learning modules as an alternative. eGMAT was recommended to me by a friend of mine who was already an eGMAT user and had high praise for it. 

The eGMAT course is very well structured and organised. I used eGMAT primarily to master SC and CR. The theory, explanation and techniques are well put forth in their numerous modules. The visual explanations complement the audio content well and help one retain what they have learned. eGMAT lays emphasis on techniques such as meaning based approach and pre-thinking assumptions which greatly help with solving SC and CR questions, respectively. The modules can be a bit tiresome but it's important to stay focused and punctually work through them to get your fundamentals right. The application files and concept practice files/quizzes embedded within the modules do a great job of summarising and reinforcing the concepts to be mastered. The RC files are useful to identify the types of questions and what the corresponding answer may look like. I did not use eGMAT to prepare for Quant or IR, so I can't comment on those sections.

The Scholaranium platform makes practice ever so convenient. While the customisability, insights and usability are all great, the quality of the content and feedback takes the cake. The questions seemed to cover good ground in terms of the concepts taught. And more importantly, the detailed explanations for the questions are based on the same framework that one would have adopted from the modules. This makes it easy to absorb the feedback. The questions can sometimes be a bit lengthy but practicing solving such questions only helps you with your timing. 

The eGMAT subscription also came with 5 Sigma X mock tests. I used some of these tests primarily to assess my verbal ability and to get my timing right. As expected, a detailed analysis and feedback of your performance is available to you if you choose to do a post mortem. The mocks give you a fair (or maybe a slightly conservative) assessment of where you stand with regards to your verbal goal. However, I felt that the quant tested in the Sigma X mocks was a level higher than the quant tested in OG mocks. 

Couple of areas where I think eGMAT could improve:
- Sometimes application becomes hard with time pressure. Even with a lot of practice. It would be much more useful to students if the module highlighted how to apply the taught concepts in a time crunch. 
- The navigation through the online modules could be improved so students can scroll through and revise more easily.
- Summary slides could be better organised so students can use them as a base for taking notes.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi,

Firstly, cheers to all the fellow mates who are in process of GMAT preparations and who are about to initiate. I write this review keeping in mind all their anxieties, confusions and dilemmas that anyone can have. Believe me, even I had the same kind of situation when I first appeared for my GMAT. While I was confident about both Quants and VR, the scores turned out otherwise. This was an eyeopener and I realized that I was doing something really wrong. And that is where I actively started looking for guidance. I chose to go with eGMAT course immediately.

Things that happened with me within a week of starting the course:

1. Enlightenment: I realized why did I score that low in VR in my first attempt. I realized where exactly was I making mistakes, be it grammar, reading methods, the process of solving questions or the time management. All these realizations were due to a well designed eGMAT course structure.

2. Dilemma: Just like in every online course that we take, this course initially brought a lot of dilemma to me and I was not sure if I was going on a right track even after all the above realizations. One reason for this was also the lack of personal touch which we are usually accustomed to. In this time, the eGMAT support team helped me stay calm and they made sure I follow the process well.

Over the next 2 months of my preparations, I literally started feeling comfortable with the process and method of learning. Ultimately, I was instilled with confidence when the results started showing up in mocks and scholaranium quizzes. I saved most amount of my time in SC (literally 50%) and RC (about 40%) and that ultimately helped complete my VR section almost on time.

Best to look out for at eGMAT:
1. Meaning based approach: initially when eGMAT suggested slow and meaningful reading, I was puzzled as I was already having time issues in VR section. But trust me guys, this approach is a boon. It helped me save most amount of time. It is a skill which will come for your rescue not only for the exams but for many work years ahead.

2. Quick response to queries: maximum of my queries were answered within hours, be it on mail or on portal itself.

3. Scholaranium: Level of the practice questions, in my opinion, is quite accurate and good. The that analytics and strategic reviews give you exact opinions as to where did you go wrong. NOTE: do your strategic review wisely, it helped me the most in visiting and revisiting my methods, concepts and the time management process. 

I hope this review helps well. All the best!!

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT Journey began in April 2020. Like many others, I decided to make the most of the extra time on my hands to start preparing for the GMAT. 

During the course of my preparations, I got married, moved to a different state in the US and settled into a new job and all through that process, e-GMAT helped ensure that I kept plugging away at my preparation to help me reach my target score.

Nearly 19 months later after taking the Enhanced GMAT online and scoring 710 (Q: 48 V: 38) I would like to pass on my learnings to future test takers in the hope that this helps streamline their preparations and reach their target scores.

Real-Life learnings from the GMAT:
The GMAT as a test fascinated me. Unlike many of the other standardized tests out there, the GMAT is a test that actually tests skills that you would need to apply in the long run to navigate a future career in business. For Example, Sentence correction is important to understand what effective communication looks like, wherein mistakes in sentence structure could convey a meaning different that what was intended. Critical reasoning is something that one would be expected to apply daily as a business leader to make key decisions, but also in your daily life as you navigate through difficult decisions. Reading Comprehension in my humble opinion is the skill that is the least talked about and probably the most important long term skill that preparing for the GMAT gives a test taker. The ability to process information however complex to understand, in a timed environment, is absolutely key in one’s development.

My Takeaways :
Hyper personalization
I was invited by Archit Bhargava to be part of the e-GMAT LMP (Last Mile Program) program, a program where he would support me as a mentor through my GMAT journey. Archit’s timely feedback and hyper personalized study plan based on my Scholaranium 2.0 quiz scores was invaluable. Whenever I had questions and/or needed to modify my study plan to better fit my schedule, Archit replied back with a plan to make the best use of the time I had available. Over the course of 2 months, Archit either sent me videos whenever I got stuck on certain key concepts or got me to connected to other members of the e-GMAT team for their insight to help me understand specific topics better.
At this time I would also like to give a shout out to Harsha, who provided me a comprehensive analysis of my CR performance that pushed me over a plateau of where I was stuck at the 65%ile all the way upto a consistent 90%ile and Atreya, who the weekend before my official GMAT provided a review of my performance of my last mock to give me target areas to focus my last reviews on, when Archit was unavailable. 

The LMP program was exactly what I needed to cross the 700 barrier and I can’t thank the e-GMAT team enough for always being there to support me through my journey.

Approach
e-GMAT provides a structured curriculum, one that focuses on process and content in equal measure with special emphasis on test readiness and simulating section wise tests from Scholaranium 2.0 to ensure that students are ready to tackle the Sigma-X mocks that are also offered on their platform.
Their 3 step process of 1) Building conceptual knowledge ( core content) 2) Cementing test taking process and 3) developing GMAT skills helped me first understand and then apply the concepts in an organized manner.
One of the things e-GMAT does very well is offer structure. You can plan exactly what you need to do every day of your prep and account for how long your preparation could potentially take based on your current score and your target score and this helped me understand the scope of the task in front of me and the daily accountability that the schedule provided helped me stay on track with my preparations.

Platform
The Scholaranium 2.0 is by far the most powerful platform that I’ve seen out there for a few reasons. Firstly, The data gathered from the quizzes I took on the platform was translated into easy-to-understand actionable feedback that helped me identify any process flaws, timing issues and/or knowledge gaps that need to be worked on. 
Secondly, the ability to design custom quizzes to ensure that I could simulate a real life test environment, where I would need to keep on their feet at all times, was a game changer for me and I believe strongly that this practice is what helped push me over my plateau.
Finally, The level of questions that I saw on my official GMAT was comparable to if not slightly easier than the ones that e-GMAT offers. Now, I know there is not substitute for OG content since the GMAC spends a lot of money developing each question, but I believe what the questions on e-GMAT taught me was “how to think”. This is an underestimated skill that I have not seen many platforms talk about. The quote that comes to mind that best explains this is : “If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.” 

Sigma X Mocks
The Sigma-X mocks were a real eye-opener. I had always perceived my Quant skills to be at a high enough level since I came from a Quant heavy engineering background. I quickly learned that although my math skills were where they needed to be, on the other hand my Quantitative reasoning was definitely not. This was a very important distinction to make and one I hope others reading this review pay attention to. 
My scores on the last 3 Sigma-X mocks were 700 (Q46, V39), 710 (Q47, V40), 710 (Q49, V38) with my last 710 coming 3 days before my official GMAT on which I ended up with a 710 (Q48,V38). As you can see, the scores are highly representative of actual GMAT performances.
Going into my Official GMAT, I was confident that I had seen enough content and variations based on that content that tested in-depth understanding rather than superficial knowledge and having that peace of mind prevented me from stressing about if I knew enough and tackle each question confidently. 

My study mentor: Archit Bhargava
My journey would not have been the same without Archit. He was there to answer my questions or direct me to other personnel at e-GMAT as I reached certain plateaus in my preparation. Close to the end he also gave me personal number so that the turnaround times to my questions would be quicker. Without the feedback and assistance he offered, I can confidently say that I do not think I could have broken the 700 barrier. Archit was the gamechanger I needed.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I became an EGMAT student in May 2021. Before doing so, I had taken the GMAT exam once and to prepare, had enrolled myself in a popular Bangalore-based coaching. While I knew about EGMAT even back then, I just couldn't believe that a completely-online portal can be as impactful as the ones that offer ""live and personalized learning"". Having used the EGMAT platform for almost 6 months, I can, without a doubt, say that I was wrong - not only about how good EGMAT is but also about it being just another online preparation platform. 

Following are some of the differentiators for EGMAT:

1. Course Structure - Entire content is broken down into bite-sized videos. Rather than focusing on shortcuts and smart tricks, the EGMAT course helps in drilling down the concepts. You learn a topic, then practice questions with varying difficulty, and move ahead only once you are comfortable. This cycle worked really well for me as I already understood some concepts but here, I could apply them one at a time and learn step-by-step

2. Equal focus on Quant and Verbal - There are a lot of products out there that are strong in either Verbal or Quant but not both. EGMAT, on the other hand, helped me balance my preparation in both sections. I started with SC and was blown away by all the concepts and questions offered. While there isn't a lot of theory to learn in CR and RC, the pre-thinking approach certainly helped. Within quant, the course is broken down into various sub-sections within Arithment and Algebra-Geometry and the questions are presented in a way that makes it a routine to solve even harder ones within the stipulated time. 

3. Scholaranium - Previously, when I used to practice, I did not have very clear insights on what am I weak in. Sure, I could know that, say, am not so strong in Verbal, or even narrow it down to Sentence Correction but the data presented in Scholaranium breaks the weaknesses down to sub-sections. I could clearly know the topic where am taking a lot of time or my accuracy is poor, and rather than focusing on the entire section, could do focused brush-up by creating custom quizzes. An extremely helpful feature is ""Ask the Expert"". Rather than looking up different websites where I went wrong in my approach to a question, I could ask an EGMAT expert or even better, just look at similar doubts asked by fellow students. The response rate in the former case was great and this helped in keeping the momentum up. The SigmaX mocks are very close to the actual exam and the debriefing of each question is super helpful.

4. Personalized Support - This is where EGMAT transcended from being a good to a great course, for me. I was bucketed into the Last Mile Profile and right from Day 1, my mentor Atreya Roy has been my go-to person for all queries - right from any doubts on what topic to pick up next to any confusion around whether am progressing in the right direction. Atreya was always quick to analyze my tests and mocks and suggest an improvement plan. I have actually just stuck to his suggestions throughout the journey and that has worked wonders for me. I always used to struggle with my pacing but in my actual GMAT, I almost finished Verbal on time and could solve each Quant question. 

In summary: If anyone is looking for a comprehensive GMAT course, EGMAT should be your choice. Attend a couple of free webinars or take the trial and you will realize how amazing the platform is. I thank my mentor Atreya and the entire EGMAT team for their support :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","1","0","","","December 17, 2021","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hi Manas,  

Congratulations on your score and thank you for your kind words. 

We had a great journey together! When I looked at your account, I concluded that it is one of the most diligent journeys I have witnessed. Here is why: 

1. Your accuracies were phenomenal: 70% accuracy in hard questions (Screenshot 1) indicates high potential for success. 

2. Consistent scores in Test Readiness Quizzes: You took more than 5 TR quizzes while maintaining 75% accuracy or higher in each one (Screenshot 2).  

3. Responsive and receptive: In our 10+ email interactions, you were always responsive and receptive to my recommendations, even when they meant additional work for you.

																			by score report","Points","Location","My journey of a 710 Q48 V40 on the GMAT was slightly longer than I had expected to be. I started preparing for GMAT in February 2021 with the hopes of getting a decent score that would put me in a competitive range. Initially, my preparation was largely self-driven, and I relied on my notes from early years. However, I quickly realised that Quant on the GMAT is not that straight forward, and enough time has passed since I graduated college that I have become rusty and will need help. 

I evaluated a lot of programs GMAT preparation and ended up choosing e-GMAT. There were multiple things I immediately loved about the e-GMAT portal, especially the adaptive nature of the modules and how it helps you understand what your strengths and weaknesses are on specific sections of Quant and Verbal. SigmaX mocks are also helpful in gauging you preparation levels and help in general prepare for the D-day!

I really want to call out the help I received from my guide on e-GMAT, Atreya (Atreya Roy, if you are wondering what his full name is!). Gem of a person and one hell of a GMAT support! He played a pivotal role in me getting a 710 on the GMAT - from initially guiding me on how I should plan my overall preparation (with hyper-specific plans) to helping me daily whenever needed in fine tuning my preparation to helping plan a final 7 days schedule before my exam. He was always there and was always available for help. I remember him replying to my texts at 1 AM in the night and getting on calls whenever I had a clarification. I sincerely believe that he played a very big role in me getting the score of 710 and I genuinely cannot thank him enough for this help and support. While I would recommend e-GMAT to anyone looking for good quality GMAT coaching, I would very highly recommend you ask for Atreya by name in case you do end up choosing e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","2","0","","","","","",""

I came in touch with DJ from E-GMAT team and his first step was analysing my ESR(Enhanced Score Report) of my second attempt. The analysis was clear that I was hovering around 65-70 percent ability in all 3 sections of Verbal and work will have to be done in all the three sections. He shared with me a detailed plan for improvement.

I started with the reading exercises shared by DJ to improve my reading/comprehending skills. Further, Master Comprehension course provided by E-GMAT also helped me in gaining the right strategies to handle Reading Comprehension questions.For Critical Reasoning and Sentence Correction the webinars conducted by Rajat,Payal from E-GMAT team are really good and gives you the right approach to kick start your preparation in these sections.

DJ emphasised on Pre Thinking approach for Critical Reasoning and using it definitely helped me in boosting my score. Coming up with your own assumptions before jumping into the answer options definitely helps. For Sentence Correction, the meaning based approach(Intended meaning of the sentence) is the only right way to solve medium and hard questions in the given time frame. With trap answer choices all around this strategy definitely works.  

The strategy of cementing your learning through scholaranium is gold standard and it raises your ability considerably in that section. One can take multiple quizzes from scholaranium with more than 600+ verbal questions which are on par with the real GMAT questions. There is a detailed analysis available for each question attempted with most of the tougher questions having a video analysis. Scholaranium tool also has an error log which provides useful information like topic wise ability in each sub-section. Key to getting a good GMAT score is to use scholoranium to its potential. 

I was able to get the 30 point improvement(V-34 to V-38) in under a month through the E-GMAT score.I would highly rate the E-GMAT online course for the verbal preparation as it is structured and quite easy to navigate. Further you can easily get in touch with E-GMAT mentors like DJ who are always ready to help.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=59#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","The e-GMAT approach is truly a game changer. As a non-native speaker, the e-GMAT interactive and self-pacing approach really helps me be more efficient in my preparation. I personally used Manhattan prep 7 years ago. While it was good and it helped me to score a 700, I was not able to take the next leap to 700+. This time around, I figured I needed to use a different approach to break the 700 barrier and I am proud to say that the e-GMAT approach really works.

After reading reviews on GMAT club, I decided to use e-GMAT back in late June. In my first SIGMA-X mock, I only scored a 630. The meaning based approach for sentence correction and the pre-thinking methodology for critical reasoning is a game changer BUT you really, really need to master it and do not short circuit. I personally had a time when I knew the concept, but was not able to apply it efficiently while solving questions. It was VERY frustrating and I thought about giving up the meaning based approach many times. BUT do not give up. I went back to study the materials again to master the methodology and was slowly able to use the right approach to solve questions effectively and accurately. 

In addition, having an error log and analyzing every single question and every single option is super important. As mentioned by many before me, quality trumps quantity. Make sure you learn from every single question and find your weaknesses. 

In my second and third SIGMA-X mock tests, I received a 760 and 750 respectively. It was really eye opening on the power of the e-GMAT material. However, because of some major technical issues in my online GMAT exam, I was only able to score 700. 

After this, DJ from e-GMAT reached out to me to join the Last Mile Program (LMP) and I can tell you this was next level. The first thing we did was figure out what’s wrong and why did you score just a 700 and not more than that. The process of diagnosis was done by DJ and we figured out that I take longer on SC, CR questions – and get tired. Therefore, we started a 3 step process to solidify my ability and increase my stamina. 

In the first phase 3R plan (Revise, Review and Reboot), DJ asked me to go back to review all of my previous notes. This was meant to get me back in GMAT studying mode. This phase was completed by taking a few tests on SC, CR and RC and achieving >70% accuracy.

In the next phase, I went through all of the mistakes I've made in the past through my error log. The analysis template provided by e-GMAT is super helpful and also really insightful in finding my weaknesses. In this phase, I noticed that I was getting lazy in pre-thinking so I went back to the CR material again to practice pre-thinking.

In the final phase, it was an intense 4-day cycle last mile. SIGMA-X mock -> Stress Test -> Pace Test -> Weakness Review. And I can tell you this was really important in building up stamina. One of the hiccups I had was getting a 640 on my last SIGMA-X mock test. Here I would like to especially thank DJ for continue to encourage me and keep me calm during this set back. He noticed that I had ability gaps in my SC and CR and was able to help me continue to focus and keep pace in my preparation. Some other useful test taking tips that helped me included warm-up exercises and testing at the end of the day. Every little tip helped.

Lastly, I would just like to thank DJ and the e-GMAT team for helping me achieve my target score I set back in June. Also, for everyone still hesitating, I would encourage you to fully commit to the program and stick to the process. It my take longer than you expect, but you will get there!

When I figured out that there's more than just subject knowledge needed to crack GMAT, I started looking for an online course that would help me in the same. That's when I took a trial session with E-GMAT. 

The course is so comprehensive that I didn't find the need to look further. E-GMAT not only helps understand the concepts but also helps with the approach to get above 700.

																			by score report","Points","Location","After my first GMAT attempt stood at a 690 score (it took a good amount of self-study and practice), I could not leave it to chance to get past the 700-mark since I had given it all. As for most non-native speakers, my first score reflected a lack of preparation for Verbal section with a V34. And so, researching on which verbal prep course to sign up for became the Level-0 for my second shot at GMAT. The reviews on GMAT club for the course providers seemed to be a credible source given the verified score improvements, and among those, e-GMAT stood out by a huge margin. My secondary research for e-GMAT on its free webinars and recorded videos gave me no less reason to go for it.

e-GMAT asks a simple thing of you when you sign up. Forget what you think you know. Doing so is not as simple as it sounds, but rewards you the more you believe in the course’s philosophy. The course is designed in such a way that it makes you effortlessly dive deep into basics and ensures that you haven’t lost the crux of the initially studied concepts till the very end, while comprehensively touching upon every testable area in the GMAT exam.

Beginning with its infamous SC course, e-GMAT brings in the Meaning Based Approach which, in my opinion is the life saver for many when attempting a lot of 600+ and 700+ level questions. This approach, combined with the relevant grammatical rules, makes up for a huge chunk of the course, proportionate to its importance in the Verbal preparation. For the CR sub-section, the course introduces to concepts usually overlooked by a lot of test-takers such as identification of premises and conclusion, grasping the author’s intent, and prethinking the assumptions before jumping to option analysis. Following the prescribed process reduced my average time spent on the CR questions by about 25%, which let me have more time to attempt the once dreadful RC questions. RC too became easier through e-GMAT’s Master Comprehension pointers at the beginning of the course, which became a habit by the time I reached RC sub-section.

To supplement it all, the newly introduced Scholaranium 2.0 which includes all of e-GMAT’s practice questions has a very high-quality database for explanations and data insights for each and every question in it. This same quality applies to the Sigma-X Mocks designed by e-GMAT, giving these tests their accuracy.

In addition to all of the preparation, the support provided by e-GMAT’s strategy experts in the Last Mile Program is something that brought me to a V41 and a 70 points improvement. Shweta Koshija, one of the experts at e-GMAT, was available throughout my course tenure and helped me through personalized videos and hyper-specific plans for any and all of my queries.

Considering all of it, signing up for e-GMAT should be a no-brainer for anyone aiming a competitive GMAT score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","","","",""

Practice: the platform that E-Gmat uses to help you in practicing questions provides more than enough data for you individually analyze your weak sections and subsections.

Quant: The new quant 2.0 prep material is extremely targeted. The idea is that you can focus on areas that you need particular help with (if that's the approach you need to take due to time constraints)

Mocks: The mocks are slightly tougher than the actual test (quant is tougher, verbal is very representative).

I analysed my results and began working towards improving the 'weaker' areas like most of us after the baseline. However, after about 2-3 months of self-prep (about 3-4 hours per day during the week and 6-7 hours over the weekend), I did not see any improvement in my scores for the second official mock. I decided to do something about it as (again, like the most of us) I wanted to secure a 700+ score for myself as soon as possible.

Having read positive reviews about e-GMAT and having heard a few personal experiences from acquaintances as well, I scheduled a quick strategy call with an e-GMAT expert to understand the best next steps and went ahead with the focused online course the very next day.
Due to my work commitments, I could only spare about 3-4 hours on a weekday and about 6-7 hours on a weekend, and that was sufficient to cover the complete course in about 15 days. This was also the estimate provided by the course in the initial set up which was pretty accurate. The support team was extremely professional, I checked in with them almost once in two days and received quick responses in terms of feedback and next steps. The master comprehension for verbal in general, meaning-based approach in SC, pre-thinking approach in RC and extremely well guided modules for Quant helped me immensely. The Scholaranium 2.0 dashboard and analytics helped me identify weak areas as I progressed - not just in terms of questions I got wrong but questions where I spent significantly more time than the median population. The explanations and solutions were super helpful and helped me save a lot of prep time as well.

I scored 690 on my first GMAT, but I knew I could've done better so I decided to re-take it in 16 days.
For these 16 days, I was provided support and guidance by Dhananjay Lowe, who customised my ability scores from my previous mock by adjusting the luck factor (since I was sure my e-GMAT mock score of 680 was skewed upwards), provided a 16 day customised plan, checked in with me and provided super honest and useful feedback. He also shared a personalised video feedback on a few critical areas where I faltered in a custom quiz (this was a test readiness quiz one day before my test) which guided me about topics I needed to revise before my test and about mindful of my time-wasting tendencies (which also reduced my takt time overall).

I ended up with a score of 700 on my second test (where my quant score improved from V41 to V48) and I'm extremely grateful for Dhananjay and team's honest feedback to help me keep pushing till the last very last day.

While I know the feedback is very lengthy, I hope it helps fellow students in taking the necessary steps to reduce their prep time and achieve their target score.

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT journey started back in February. I had a goal in my mind to give the exam latest by July to apply in R1 for the MIM program in Europe.
I started with clearing my basics from Manhattan. Since I have always had a comfort level with Quant, it hardly took me 3-4 weeks to get a stronghold on GMAT quant. And later, I began with Verbal – starting with SC, followed by CR, and finally RC. Together with Verbal, I made sure to practice Quant daily so that I don't lose the grip on the concepts.
Though I struggled with Verbal in the initial days, I started doing better as weeks passed by, and ultimately, I started giving the official mocks. My score on the official mocks ranged from 740 to 780 and henceforth, I booked my exam for the second week of September. I was pretty confident on the day of the exam – Considering my score on the official mocks! 
I started with Quant (my comfort zone) and bombed it pretty bad. I had to guess the last 10 questions and my confidence went down pretty bad, which impacted my Verbal as well. I couldn’t perform to my best and I was certain that I wouldn’t get anywhere near 700. But when I clicked on END EXAM – I got the shock of my life. The screen showed 600 (Q41 and V32)!!! I wasn’t expecting a score this low. 
I was highly disappointed with my quant score specifically since I always scored a Q50 or a Q51. And the Quant on the real exam is way tougher than the one provided on mocks

While I was exiting from the Exam center, I was certain that I would go with E-Gmat for my second attempt, give it a month and apply in R2. I decided to go for E-Gmat since I have seen amazing reviews of the platform on GMATCLUB and YouTube and people getting a 100+ score improvement in a few weeks. 
I took a break for 10-15 days and bought the e-GMAT plan for a month. I started with giving the first mock and analyzed my weaker areas in both Quant and Verbal. The personalized study plan further helped me in following a structured approach in my preparation. I booked the exam for the second week of November and studied diligently. 


E-GMAT, to be precise, has helped me in several ways. Not only did it help me in improving my Vimprove my Verbal, but it with good methodologies in Quant. Which ultimately
E-GMAT helped me in the following ways


1.	I was able to equip myself with better and structured methodologies in Word Problems and Number Properties – the areas in which my accuracy was relatively low and I used to take more time while solving these questions (even below 600 level).

2.	I learned the Meaning Driven approach in SC and my accuracy became way better just in 5-6 days. The Practice Files and GMAT skills file helped a lot in grasping the techniques and methodologies. The best and the most unconventional thing I found was ""Breaking the myth on ‘being’.

3.	Coming to CR – MY WORST FEAR! The falsification conclusion and Pre-thinking techniques in E-GMAT helped in solving CR questions in a timely and efficient manner. MY accuracy in CR was as low as 35% and it sky-rocketed to 85% in just a couple of days- thanks to E-GMAT! 
 
Now Coming to the best part about E-Gmat – The Last Mile Program.
I was invited by Archit Bhargava to be a part of this program, 15-16 days before my exam. He analyzed the SIGMA-X Mock my ESR report of the previous attempt and designed personalized improvement plans for the sections in which I lacked the most. He gave me 2-3 days' targets accordingly and would see if my accuracy has improved or not in the respective section. He helped me understand where I had conceptual gaps, where I had to focus on process skills, and where I was good at but still needed to work on the timing. His plans were precise and realistic to follow. He helped me overcome my fear of CR. Even if I was doing good in CR before coming in touch with him, he asked me to visit the process and GMAT skills file again and re-learn the methodologies, and to be honest that was the most beneficial advice for me in this whole journey. He made sure that I attempt all the hard level questions of CR- I was running away from them but he made me face my fears and conquer them.

Archit even recorded a personalized video of my mock attempts and made sure that I learn from my mistakes. The video revolved around the timing strategies, the concepts, and how to go about the real exam. He made me understand that things can go South if you spend more than 4 minutes on a question and still get that wrong – certainly because of which I flunked my first attempt. The best thing about Archit was that he responded to me even during the weekends and Diwali, he understood that my exam was approaching and never backed off from responding to my queries. 

 I inculcated his insights and advice in my second attempt and was able to come closer to my target score. I got a 700 (Q50, V35). When the score flashed in front of me- all I could think about was that it wouldn't have been possible without e-GMAT and the endless support of Archit.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","","","",""

I was frustrated and thought I needed a structured approach, and my system was not working out. I looked at reviews (I was very sceptical at first) and found that eGMAT seems to be the best bet. 

I decided to opt for eGMAT. Below are some of the details from eGMAT that helped me reach a 750 (V41,Q50)

Personalised Study Plan: This is a helpful resource for someone who knows what GMAT is and where they stand. It helped me understand my ESR as well as helped me structure my plan as I only had two months to prepare.

Verbal:
1. Master Comprehension: For people who want to improve in verbal, this is a MUST. This course not only helped me in RC but also CR and somewhat in SC, and this helped me understand and extract the meaning of paragraphs in one reading, which is a must to improve in RC.

2. SC: By far one of the most detailed courses in SC. They have broken SC down into multiple pieces, and although the Error analysis for choice A seems a bit too time consuming, this will help in the long run.

3. CR: This course has helped me reduce my out of scope errors by a considerable margin. There are good examples and application files in this. 

4. RC: The Application files helped me use the master comprehension approach and build this approach with the application files.

Quant:

A lot of people say that the Quant is not that great within the eGMAT course. The structured way of solving questions is much simpler to apply using the learning from the quant courses. 

Being an Engineer, I was taught to use the fastest approach (be it mental math), but this course helped me bring a structure to solve even the fundamental questions which minimise the errors that may happen.

One thing is that the questions are slightly more challenging than what you may get in the actual GMAT; they sure help build the core so that we don't get overwhelmed during the real GMAT.

I too had doubts before making the purchase, and given that I had only two months to prep, I am glad that I chose eGMAT.

For anyone who has started with eGMAT, I would suggest going through the Study plan, Analyse your ESR (or SigmaX) and creating a Plan. And DO NOT skip master comphrension. 

Other aspects of the course can be skipped if you are confident about your abilities, but in order to do so, do understand your capabilities based on either ESR or the SigmaX mock.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","","","",""

I will recommend E-GMAT to everyone who wants to score high on verbal section.  

What I liked the most? 
Hyper personalization 
I was invited by Archit Bhargava to be part of LMP (Last Mile Program), a program where he would support me as a mentor. I cannot thank Archit enough for his support during my GMAT prep. He analyzed every single part of the Six Sigma X Mocks I took, beginning with my initial diagnosis one, and designed personalized improvement plans for each of the sections of the exam. He helped me understand where I had conceptual gaps, where I had to focus on process skills, and what areas I had already “conquered”. Archit also supported me until my exam day, helping me overcome any fall, to arrive at the GMAT with full confidence.

Approach 
e-GMAT has a very structured approach to achieve test readiness. Each of the subtopics of both Quant and Verbal is structured around a three-step learning process: (1) concept, (2) process, (3) GMAT skills. This method allows one to be certain of the readiness to move to the following step, and to calibrate the time dedicated to each subtopic in a very personalized way. 

Platform 
The Scholaranium 2.0 is a very powerful platform. It provides as many KPIs and metrics as one can imagine to identify the process flaws and knowledge gaps at a very detailed level to know exactly what to do to improve. It keeps track of the results for the different levels of questions. With Scholaranium 2.0, one can design custom quizzes and can even choose the subtopic! For example, one can design a quiz only on hard-level questions on modifiers within the SC section. The explanation of how questions should be resolved is very detailed and allows one to identify what went wrong or to confirm a correct. 

Sigma X Mocks 
The Sigma X Mocks very well represent the real exam. The adaptative software makes the experience very similar to that of the GMAT. From my own personal experience, I can say these mock exams even have more difficult questions than the GMAT, which allows one to be confident that when preparing for this hard questions, one is for sure covering the difficulty that will be find in the exam.

My study mentor: Archit 
My journey would not have been the same without Archit. He was there to take my phone call at whatever hour each time I felt I would not make it in time, to adapt my study plan around my crazy work schedule, to help me define concrete next steps. Archit was the game changer in my GMAT journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by post count","Points","Location","I had been in contact with the EGMAT team for more than 8 months and I have used their course for a total of 3 months. In my 3 GMAT Attempts, this course proved to be very useful. 
In experience with the EGMAT Course, I felt it was very smooth and helpful. The content was top-notch and the strategies used were really benefitting me in my GMAT Prep. The meaning based approach used in SC helped me increase to 94th percentile and the Pre-thinking also helped me gain a 80th percentile in CR. The team also shared Error Log templates with me for specific sections. These templates allowed me to myself understand my weak points in CR and SC. Truly, this course is the perfect option for self-study enthusiasts who need guidance and mentorship. Furthermore, they have revamped their Quant course recently. The new version allows a student to customize his or her study experience. This makes studying really efficient as a student can now study only what topics he needs or is weak at. I was a strong scorer in Quants. The Quant 2.0 allowed me to do a lot of diagnostic quizzes and decipher which are the specific points, where I am weak. For example, I was getting 66% accuracy in Geometry in the past 2 GMAT attempts. Through the Quant 2.0 and Skill data option, I was able to find the core topics of Geometry where I was unable to improve. These included Coordinate Geometry and Quadrilaterals for me, but for any other student, this option allows to go very deep and find strong as well as weak points during preparation. This is undoubtedly the best course out there and combined with their world-class support team, there is nothing more you can ask.
The support team is by-far the best in GMAT Preparation. Although I had been impatient quite a lot of times, the team was very polite and understanding. Apart from this, the EGMAT team helped me analyse my ESRs from the 2 attempts, wherein I scored 680, very well. They were able to clearly pinpoint my errors in CR and RC and then suggested a customized plan to become better at these topics as well. It was a very data-oriented approach that was bound to yield positive results. The team also created small-yet powerful plans for specific areas such as revision or score enhancement. For instance, I mailed once for a revision in SC and CR, about 14 days before my actual GMAT. The team sent me a refresher course and a quick-revision plan as well. These 2 plans are truly amazing. I was able to revise all core concepts, practice fundamental questions and revise everything in just 2 days. I cannot really ask for anything more as the team was there at every little step when I needed guidance or just motivation. They were very quick in their replies and they were able to solve all my queries through a simple Email. It was convenient, effective and efficient. EGMAT Team also uses the concept of ‘Test Readiness.’ This is simply a set of quizzes a student needs to give to understand his accuracy levels and decide if he is ready for the actual battle of GMAT or not. I was really happy as the team sent me details of doing these quizzes and also personally guided me by studying the results of these Test Readiness Quizzes. This feature helps a candidate to understand if he is actually ready or more preparation is needed. 
I would particularly like to share my experience with DJ, aka Dhananjay. DJ has been with me since my first attempt and he has helped me stay consistent with GMAT.  There have been times when I lost hope but DJ always motivated me to study and crack this exam. I owe my 710 to DJ. His strategies and study plans were built on logic and involved a lot of data usage from the EGMAT Portal. Thus, these plans worked with almost 100% accuracy. I would definitely recommend DJ for any student. He is really a gem who can take you to your dream score. DJ was so kind to also help me with Essay analysis and editing process for top MiM Courses such as LBS and INSEAD. He spent many hours helping me craft the perfect essay. He is really one of the best instructors out there who goes beyond the expected to help a student. I am really blessed to have him as my mentor.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","You may get courses or study material from anywhere on the internet these days, but what leads to a good score is a structured approach and a definite plan of success which I believe is e-GMAT's forte. 

I had appeared for my first attempt in 2020 where I had scored a 620; I took my second attempt this year and got a 90-point improvement to 710 in my score with e-GMAT’s Online course. (Great improvement in verbal, from V26 to V40) 

The major difference between my first and second attempt was the approach that I took while preparing for the test. During my first attempt, I did not follow any plan and was aimlessly studying the courses, not understanding the correct way to improve my GMAT score. While in my second attempt, I diligently followed the personalized study plan suggested by the e-GMAT support team. When you follow the plan, you will see how your ability increases step-by-step which in turn, increases your confidence and belief in getting a good score in your final GMAT test. 

The Verbal and Quant courses at e-GMAT are systematic and well thought out, emphasizing on the process/strategy required to apply while answering any question type. Few highlights of the course which helped me improve my score were the meaning-based approach for SC, pre-thinking and pro-active approach for CR and RC and importance of clear visualization for Quant. 

On the other hand, Scholaranium played a very important role in understanding my areas of improvement. Skill-based data given by the AI helps you work on very specific topics that you can build on to boost your GMAT score.  

Special Kudos to the e-GMAT support team, their promptness and patience in dealing with any questions or concerns was amazing. They always got back to me within one business day. I would like to thank Aditee(my e-GMAT mentor) for always taking out time to help me understand my weak areas and explaining how target practice would help me more than a blanket practice. It was a great relief to always have an expert support to rely on during stressful times. 

All in all, I would highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone who is looking to start their GMAT prep and achieve their target score. 😊

All the best! Cheers!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","For someone who was coming from a 690 (Q46 V39 IR 5) and had been constantly stuck in the 670 - 710 range in all his mocks, eGMAT was a blessing!

It is easier to train someone who is completely fresh and new to GMAT vs someone who has certain fixed ways of approaching problems. The latter involves an additional step of unlearning a few things and then learning using new techniques. I believe this is where eGMAT aced it for me!

I got a personal strategy trainer as I was looking for a targeted 40 point improvement. I wanted a 730 and didn't have much time.

We started with a detailed analysis of the ESR from my 690 attempt. While my verbal scores were okay-ish, needed to work a bit on CR to improve it to an 80th percentile, it was ALG-GEO in Quant that needed a lot of attention.

Quant 2.0 really helped in this. I went through the concepts files and sectional diagnostic quizzes to understand my weak areas. There were some refreshingly new ways to solve problems quickly, like the Wavy Line method which drastically cut down the time taken per question.

The role of my strategy coach, DJ, was immense. He closely monitored my performance and kept pushing me to finish the modules in time. He then suggested Cementing quizzes. This, for me, is that did the trick. The targeted approach of 2 Medium + 2 Hard + 1 Mixed Bag quiz after each Quant section really hammered in the concepts. The fact that all the quizzes were timed really helped me since my biggest battle was to finish the Quant section within time limits and with the desired accuracy levels.

In CR, the pre-thinking approach I learned really helped me up my game.

The culmination of the preparation was doing Test Readiness Quizzes within Scholarinium. The flexibility of the tool helps you attack exactly what your weak areas are and helps you improve drastically.

A huge shout out to eGMAT's mentorship program and specially my mentor, Dhananjay. He is prompt with his replies, detailed in his analysis, relentless in his motivation and targeted in his strategic approach. He would give me day by day plan with detailed threshold limits and anaylsed my performance to pin point my exact weak areas.

The result?

690 (Q46 V39 IR5) -> 740 (Q49 V41 IR8)

I improved in all the sections! If I can do it, anyone can.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=60#","0","0","","","January 25, 2022","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Dear Student, 

Firstly, congratulations on your score improvement in just 30 days. I am very happy to see your improvement. Improving from a 690 to a 740, as you mentioned, requires a lot of effort, unlearning, and relearning, but the most important thing is to understand where do you need to improve.  

I have recorded a video to explain your journey. Watch it here: https://success.e-gmat.com/account-walkthrough-690-to-740 

For you, your steps were clear. You had to pull up your quant score and maintain or slightly improve your verbal score. This precision targeting needs an individual to follow processes and be diligent in the journey. You did it very well.  

You followed the 3-step process:  

Look at data to understand key areas to Focus on -> Revise -> Test yourself to check progress.  

The screenshot below depicts all this hard work into results. You were scoring great in Medium and Hard questions: an indicator of success. It was just a matter of time for you to post this.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Before signing up for the e-gmat course, I did extensive research on all available sources for core concepts and even attended trial sessions and webinars offered by different companies. However, I realized I needed something which would help me understand concepts from scratch and make my base strong. Since e-gmat's methods aligned with this need (as I learned in the free trial and during the webinars), I quickly clarified all my doubts with the team over a video call and jumped right in.

Fortunately, the course was way more detailed and concept-oriented than I had imagined and this became the core of my entire prep.

QUANT - An area I always thought I was weak in, was instinctively where I started from. Before jumping into key topics, I extracted everything I could from the Quant basics course which is great for anyone who wants to brush up their skills and gain more confidence in their quant foundation. The entire course is structured beautifully to take you through a detailed yet very simply explained journey via every single concept. The query section was almost always helpful in clarifying any confusion regarding the concept or a particular question. It was only once or twice that I had to reach out to the team to ask a doubt - which was also answered well within a day or so. Hence, I left the quant course with a huge shift in my confidence, as compared to where I had started from. 

Payal does a wonderful job at patiently explaining each concept and helping one build a strong foundation. Not just the methodology but the core process skills of e-gmat are reiterated multiple times throughout the course, so they become muscle memory by the end of it. My improvement from a Q38 to Q50 can be majorly credited to mastering core concepts, making process skills second nature, and deeply understanding each question (rather than just focusing on the sheer volume of questions) - and the detailed solution videos provided after every question really helped with that.

VERBAL - Starting at a V33, I just thought I needed more practice with verbal until I actually went through concept files and adopted a different strategy. 

Particularly for RC and CR, the approach taught in the files is a complete game-changer. For CR, the pre-thinking approach made a huge difference not just in the takt time but also in eliminating that confusion between 2 similar-looking answer choices. In RC, reading and making the passage summaries and overall summary, again was never the approach I followed, as I assumed it would waste time. Instead, it saved me a lot of time in the quizzes and in the actual exam and improved my efficiency significantly.

Further, one KEY FEATURE which the e-gmat platform provides is clear, drilled down, micro-level data - for timing-based, difficulty-based, subsectional, and topic-wise weaknesses. Scholaranium 2.0 is a brilliant tool to evaluate your performance. The dashboards will show you clearly where you are lacking and what topics/ types of questions need more work. As guided in the videos, it is crucial to do the quizzes as per the instructions provided to extract the maximum benefit out of them. Doing detailed reviews of a quiz and then analyzing the metrics from the dashboards before moving on to the next quiz was key to my learning process and gave me a visible 10-20% improvement in my accuracy level with each quiz.

Last but not the least, it is worth mentioning that the e-gmat has been truly commendable - with the prompt responses and constant support throughout the journey. It did not feel like this was just an online platform as I always could sense the team behind the screen not just providing video lessons but constantly accessing my performance, making me feel accountable, and providing appropriate feedback when needed. 

Towards the end of the course, I wanted to revise a few things and reluctantly asked the team if a one-week extension was possible. I was grateful to receive a free extension without having to worry about payments or formalities, especially in the last few days before the exam. That's what makes e-gmat so unique. It provides a supportive environment and top-quality experts and materials and yet is affordable, relatable, and super easy to use!

I would like to thank Aftab, Juhi, Atreya, DJ, Archit, and Manas for helping me throughout the journey. And of course kudos to Payal and Rajat for building this and bringing so many people one step closer to their dreams.

																			by score report","","Location","When I started my MBA Prep journey, I was preparing in a very unstructured manner. I bought an Official Guide and had a few other resources from a friend but it was all scattered. That's when I decided I need to get enrolled in a course to get everything streamlined and I came across e-gmat. I found the reviews really good and read stories about how it had helped people score good in their first attempt. 

The course is well-structured and cover most of the basics. The modules have illustrative videos which help you grab the concepts quicker. The quizzes between different sections are really helpful to test what you have understood and tells you if you have to revisit the concepts. The videos and the methodologies explained really helped me to solve questions faster.  I would like to specially highlight their methodologies for the verbal sections. They are well taught and help you understand the question and analyse the question really well. Every question is broken down into several parts in the concept videos and that has really helped me get a good grasp of the concepts. 

Another useful tool in the e-gmat course is the Scholoranium which has a good collection of questions and is designed in a way to help you get valuable insights about your performance - on average time taken to solve questions, sectional accuracy, topic-wise accuracy, performance graphs over a shorter period of time, etc. It's definitely the USP of e-gmat. 

Mock tests are also available with the course which further helped me acclimatise to the GMAT test. The questions and the flow of questions are quite representative of the official GMAT test. 

To sum up, e-gmat really helped me and I managed to score a 700 in my first attempt. However, I plan to seek mentorship guidance from e-gmat further to improve my score to attain my target score.

Additional Feedback after I took the mentorship - 

To add on, I took a mentorship from e-gmat and my mentor is Dhananjay Lowe from e-gmat. After I took the mentorship, Dhananjay provided me with a study plan which was personalized based on my weaknesses and abilities. He helped me analyze my key areas on improvement and suggested ways in which I could improve on my weak areas. In my first attempt of GMAT, I was not so confident but in my second attempt of GMAT, I was much more confident and was able to complete the sections in time. This was possible only after working on my weak areas continuously and taking custom quizzes as suggested by Dhananjay. I followed his instructions and was able to perform better. I got a better idea on how to analyze customized tests and mock tests after he shared videos with me. 

To sum up, e-GMAT really helps you prepare in a hyper-personalized manner, constantly focusing on what areas you are faltering in.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Having gone through several posts and reviews, I decided to go with e-GMAT for my GMAT preparation needs after hours of deliberation. I am happy to write that the course offerings provided me with all the expertise and skills to perform well in the exam. 

Study Plan - As my review subject reads, ""Well Begun is Half Done"". Having a good study plan took a lot of pressure away. I was provided with a study plan (by e-GMAT Mentor) at the start of the course. The plan helped me focus completely on the execution part and stay organized.

Sentence Correction - 
The course module is very well structured and provides you with all the necessary rules/skills to ace the sentence correction section. I was able to eliminate answer choices on deterministic grounds after going through the module. The meaning based approach (with understanding of the sentence structure) is a powerful tool to have, especially when you encounter certain idiomatic usage you're not familiar with.

Critical Reasoning - 
A process driven approach with pre-thinking as a step in the process helped me answer critical reasoning questions with more confidence. While it may not be feasible to pre-think all the scenarios, pre-thinking helped me understand the argument better and identify the conclusion.

Reading Comprehension - 
I did not finish all the modules in the RC section, but I was provided with quite a few helpful tips on how I could improve my performance in the RC section. The Master Comprehension module helps a lot with the RC section as well.

Quant 2.0  -
The Quant modules are quite extensive and cover all the concepts you need to master the Quant section. Each topic has a diagnostic test to test your current level of expertise, making it easier to personalize the course. I personally ended up spending quite a bit of time on the Quant course and would recommend doing all the modules. Every section has something to offer.

e-GMAT Mentor - Dhananjay
I worked with Dhananjay (DJ) throughout my preparation. You can find a lot of other reviews on the forum praising him for his support. While I won't be adding anything new here, but I do want to add a few words. It was really wonderful to have an expert along side during the last stretch of the preparation. DJ provided me with short study plans to address address areas of concerns and test readiness towards my last leg of preparation. The last mile push is definitely something that helps with the exam day performance. He responded to my queries and concerns in no time. e-GMAT mentor support is an invaluable and a standout feature.

I also interacted with the Support team for concerns related to my subscription. The support team always got back to me in less than a business day.

																			by score report","Points","Location","A friend of mine referred e-GMAT to me and before booking a consultation session with them, I read their reviews here on GMAT Club. No doubt, everything said the reviews was true! From the first call itself, I began feeling more organised in my approach. The first thing they asked me to do was make a personalised study plan according to my work schedule. That is probably the best thing about e-GMAT, they have put in A LOT of efforts to make the whole platform extremely personalised, almost eliminating the need of a personal tutor! All you need is determination and dedication. 
The verbal course is absolutely the best. After you complete each module, you will be required to give application and cementing quizzes, which do exactly that - cement the concepts you just learned. The question bank is pretty close to the actual GMAT level and relevant in terms of the tricks, pitfalls and concepts tested. 
My Quant is rather weak, so I felt the quant section has a lot of high level questions. Sometimes I felt they were too calculation intensive - somewhat not relevant to actual GMAT. But in terms of prep material, e-GMAT has done a great job in the quant section as well. They start from the basics and cover every type of question you may encounter on the test day. 
The prep material is great, but Scholaranium is the real game-changer. The amount of data points and improvement pathways provided are just mind blowing! I highly doubt any other platform offers such a granular level of information. You can figure out the exact topic, exact type of question and the exact difficulty level of the questions you are flattering on. 
Overall, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is aiming 700+ and is ready to do 3-4 months of intensive (and well planned) study.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I have experience with two courses:
1.	a local online course which included 24 hours of verbal and 24 hours of quant lessons with GMAT coaches (just analyzed the questions from 8 paper tests and got some basic guidance)
2.	e-gmat online 360 (1-month full intensive preparation with a dedicated strategy expert)
I am here to review to e-gmat online 360.

As I started practicing for GMAT I joined GMAT club and saw the wide variety of online courses – platforms. I looked for the best reviewed courses and after a while I decided to opt for the local courses because of the option of the coach. At the end of my preparation, I attended some webinars and was amazed by the different approach the e-gmat experts had. I took my first exam, kinda failed, and decided to enroll to e-gmat online course, which was on sale, and try my chances. 

I reached out the e-gmat team who offered a consultation call and I realized that I was following a completely different strategy when encountering SC and RC questions. The first step was to study Master Comprehension. This changed my perspective. I had to engage with what I was reading and do strategic pauses in order to comprehend and pre-think. 
Taking cementing quizzes was the second step as I had score 690 in my first attempt and wanted to fill the gaps. After the analysis of my progress with the cementing quizzes, DJ reached me in order to create the Personalized Study Plan and smash the GMAT.

Verbal: I completed the whole verbal course and it was an absolute perfection. I implemented what I have learned from the verbal course and my scores skyrocketed. 

SC: The meaning approach is above anything else. Solving SC questions with no hesitance and on time, was a key element of success, as I had more time to focus on the other two sections. The approach is being taught extensively through the course and can be mastered quickly. 

CR: My level here was good, but I had trouble with the timing. By mastering the Pre-thinking method as presented throughout the course I was able to increase my accuracy from 81% to 93% and dramatically decrease the time taken for every question, especially the hard ones. Every kind type of questions is analyzed thoroughly and all there is a plethora of tricky answer choices. Overall, I think that in CR you get prepared for the worst-case scenario by solving really hard questions, so when you take the real exam CR questions can only benefit you.

RC: This was a game-changer for me. I was struggling in RC and I had to completely change my strategy till then. Skimming the passage and not taking notes was the worst advice I had followed. Instead of utilizing that method, I learned to read, pause strategically, comprehend everything, and then pre-think before going further. That changed everything and my accuracy from 67% climbed at 89%, making me a V40 candidate. Writing down para-summaries and the main idea was my go-to method. During the last week of the preparation, I had so much confidence, that I ended up not taking notes while practicing; I had a great picture of the passage by perfecting the e-gmat RC advices.
I had daily interaction with DJ, who was analyzing my attempts at Scholaranium and my error log, so every day I knew where I had to focus and how!

Quant: Such an analytical and methodical course. I ended up completing the subsections of the quant course that DJ proposed in order to increase my accuracy levels. Every section is really analytical. There is an initial skills assessment and then you master every concept you may encounter in the exam. The best part is that you master every concept in the most methodic and practical way, solving hard questions consistently and correctly within 2 minutes. I do not even mention medium-level questions, because the accuracy there reaches 100% in about 1,5 minutes average time. 
The analytics for the Quant course are really important and you get the right amount of info in order to improve. Obviously, the Quant course takes much longer to complete, but it is the perfect pathway for Q49+. 

Scholaranium: The Scholaranium platform enables the user to modify his preparation and set the standards of his practice (type of questions, difficulty, time). I found the questions a bit on the hard side (the hard quant questions were really hard!), but since this level of difficulty is not usually encountered in the real exam, you get prepared for the worst-case scenario. 

Sigma-X mock tests: I found the test realistic and accurate in terms of scoring. The most valuable aspect is the analysis provided by the platform and the proposed areas of improvement that come with it. The questions were in par with the rest of the course and a bit harder than the real exam. 

Overall, it was an absolutely perfect experience for me. I found the course exceptionally structured. The UI was easy to handle and with the interactive guides I felt that I had a live coach on the screen of my computer. 

For me, the best part was the interaction with the team. Every question or request were being answered immediately. I have to congratulate everyone who is part of such a valuable tool for GMAT takers, but above all I want to congratulate the dedicated strategy expert I worked with, DJ.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","0","0","","","","","",""

Sharing my review for e-GMAT's course. I worked with Dhananjay (DJ) for e-GMAT for the last stretch of my preparation and it was an awesome experience throughout. I am very thankful to e-GMAT for their guidance and support.

Before joining e-GMAT, I studied by myself for around 3 months but scored only a 660. I joined e-GMAT 2 months later after another botched attempt, realizing importance of structured preparation and guidance. After I wrote the initial sigma X mock, I got advice from DJ on where exactly I was lacking- CR timing and accuracy in Quant were key issues. 

E-GMAT teaching pedagogy - DJ suggested me to go through the SC and CR modules for practicing the Meaning Based Approach in SC and Pre-thinking in CR and document my errors in the 'new error logs' formats that drill down on patterns of mistakes. The verbal questions in both the modules and scholaranium are of high quality. They helped me a lot in improving my timing strategy for verbal. The custom verbal quizzes that I took were a very close representation of the actual GMAT questions. My practice of solving awfully long and complicated RC passages from scholaranium helped me tremendously on the actual GMAT. 
I used Quant 2.0 with Xpert AI (Scholaranium 2.0) for practicing quant and took the cementing as well as custom quizzes as directed by DJ. The interface and quality of questions was exceptional. Although I felt at times that e-GMAT quant questions are far more difficult than those on the GMAT, they really broadened my ability to approach and solve tough questions within 2-3 minutes. 

LMP Support - I was in the last mile program and DJ was my assigned mentor. He was a perfect mentor throughout my time with e-GMAT. He was available when I required his inputs and offered precise advice continuously. 2 days before my first scheduled attempt, I scored a 640 on the sigma X mock and my confidence was absolutely destroyed (I had never scored below 720 in any official mocks). I remember DJ was driving when I contacted him; he immediately recorded an advice video for me right then and there from his car and suggested I reschedule the exam by 2 weeks to polish my algebra, geometry, and CR. His prompt reply and precise advice probably saved me a precious GMAT attempt. I followed his advice to a T and my next scheduled attempt was much smoother. The test taking strategies suggested by DJ worked wonderfully as well.

Outside the actual studies, I found eGMAT team to be extremely supportive and helpful. DJ and team helped me keep myself motivated. I never had to wait long for response on my questions. This was very important to me as my job is very demanding and studies have to be concentrated in a small window during the day.

Overall, I think e-GMAT is the best available course for GMAT. Especially if you're looking for score improvement, I can say this with certainty that you can blindly choose the course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","With e-gmat, You will always get a feeling that there is someone who is with you along this beautiful journey of GMAT prep and who will go above and beyond to help you in achieving your target score.

Around the end of 2020, I gave my first diagnostic test and got a score that was nowhere close to my target score. As a result, I started my research for a good online course for the GMAT. I went through the course reviews here on GMAT club and decided to go with a full GMAT course of e-gmat. Now when I look back, It was one of the best decisions I took for my GMAT prep. 

I will structure my review into 2 broad buckets: 

Course Structure :

The course is beautifully structured. I started my verbal preparation with Sentence Correction and gradually moved to critical reasoning and reading comprehension. Post completing the verbal section, I utilized the quant course to brush up on my concepts and practice hard questions.

Post completing a subsection, I would start practicing questions in the Scholaranium platform. One of the key learning during my prep is that quality matters over quantity. This brings me to the second point :

Mentorship and help from the Customer Success team:

The support which I received from e-gmat team, especially the customer success team, was instrumental in breaking the 700 barrier. My interaction with Aditee was helpful in figuring out the areas where I was faltering. She helped me realize the importance of maintaining an error log and how to do a strategic review of not only the questions which I got incorrect but also the questions which I marked correctly. 

Overall a big thumbs up to the entire team of e-gmat for creating this brilliant course. I would highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to improve their verbal score and ace the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","1","0","","","","","",""

To reach my target score I ended up taking the e-GMAT course. Honestly, it is the best decision I had taken. The videos provided by e-GMAT really helped me build my foundation and the sectional quizzes helped me cement it.

e-GMAT Scholaranium is where I could put my learning to test and narrow down on my weak spots and work on them. The solution provided by e-GMAT for each question is amazingly helpful. 

Overall what I learnt was that to prep properly solving questions correctly was not enough, we must also know why we got the question wrong and that is what e-GMAT helped me with. I highly recommend everyone to go through the e-GMAT course to reach their target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=61#","0","0","","","","","",""

What really set them apart from other test prep companies is the analysis provided after every Scholaranium test which helps you gauge your strengths and weaknesses. 

The verbal course is phenomenal. Some reading strategies taught in the course have helped me immensely through the journey. Quant questions are good for practise.

Coming to the Sigma-X mock tests - I scored a 700 in the fifth and the last mock which is very close to my actual GMAT score of 710. Dhananjay (DJ) mentored me during the final phase of my preparation. The kind of dedication that he and others at e-GMAT show is remarkable! Thank you for being a part of my jouney.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I would highly rate e-GMAT's Online 360 product.

I subscribed to e-GMAT's Verbal course in September 2020. I did so because the material I was using for Verbal prior to this purchase was not helping me much. After researching on the available products for Verbal, I narrowed down to e-GMAT's product. It was around this time that I also wanted to give my first GMAT exam. I only practised the SC course on the e-GMAT platform prior to my first attempt because of paucity of time. I scored a 650 (Q47, V33) on my first attempt with the following percentiles in Verbal: SC - 81st %ile, RC - 66th %ile and CR - 33rd %ile.

At this moment I realised the need to focus on Verbal. Before doing so I wrote to the strategy team at e-GMAT, explaining to them my situation and detailing the need for inputs for my preparation. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a swift response from the team. They put me in touch with one of their strategy experts - Dhananjay Lowe (DJ).

While I was skeptical about how my conversation with DJ would transpire, he put me at ease from the get go. Side note: If you are a lover of puns, there is no better person worth the company. After our initial conversation by mail, DJ provided me with a 6-minute analysis of my ESR. I was pleasantly surprised by this gesture for I assumed that I would get a generic response. After going through the video, DJ suggested a 5-day plan to get me back into my study routine. Since I was comparatively good with SC, the first task was to consolidate my performance in SC by taking a few Cementing quizzes on e-GMAT's Scholaranium platform. These quizzes helped me apply the correct process of understanding the meaning of the sentence to solve SC questions. This aspect is important because while it is possible to solve SC questions without understanding the sentence's meaning on easy/ medium-level questions, it becomes impossible to solve those hard-level questions without understanding what the author intends to communicate.

This brings me to the USP of e-GMAT: One of the key areas that e-GMAT focuses on is ""Approaches"" to solve Verbal problems. For instance, in SC, e-GMAT uses the 'Meaning-based' approach and in CR, it uses the 'Pre-thinking' approach. These approaches remain the same irrespective of the difficulty-level of problems. This is where the charm of these approaches kicks in because irrespective of how hard a question is, the process to answering the question remains the same.

Accordingly, I completed the CR course and its associated modules. Each of these modules has a pre-assessment quiz and a post-assessment quiz to gauge one's ability. These quizzes helped me because they threw light on aspects that I was consistently faltering at. Moreover, each of the attempted questions has a detailed analysis of how to 'approach' the question, and in turn, answer it. This guided interface was invaluable to my preparation. After completion, I took the cementing quizzes to gauge my ability-level for CR before moving on to RC and following a similar process. It is worthwhile to mention that while all of this was happening, DJ and I would send check-in mails to each other. By the end of it, we had exchanged more than 200 email conversations - mind you, this is without being enrolled in any additional program for which I had to pay additional charges.

While preparing for SC and CR, DJ also suggested that I maintain an Error Log. Until then, I hadn't prepared one for Verbal. This suggestion was pivotal to my preparation because it became handy for me to keep revisiting my Error Log. It helped me refresh my concepts and pointed me to common pitfalls that I must consciously avoid. This was possible because of the two-types of Revision that e-GMAT suggests for incorrect questions in the Cementing phase - Revision A and B. e-GMAT suggests how to strategically review each of the questions that one has attempted to ensure that one gathers maximum learning from the questions. This approach works two-fold: First, it avoids the need to constantly solve questions (just to boost one's ego); and second, it helps one to reflect, consolidate learning and then move on.

Once I completed my Verbal preparation after 3 months into this process, I took the Sigma-X mock. To my dismay, I scored a 510 (Unsure of the split, perhaps Q31 and V31). As you can imagine, I was deflated. At the same time, I knew this score was an outlier because I hadn't touched Quant in those 3 months. My bigger concern was my Verbal score which was reduced by two points (from my first Official GMAT exam). I then wrote a panic email to DJ. He replied saying, ""Quant is not something we should bother about because we've only been focussing on Verbal. But, yes. Verbal score is a concern. I would've expected you to be in the higher 30s range."" Nevertheless, he suggested that I follow the process and revise my Error Log for Verbal. In the meantime he enquired if I wanted to purchase the Quant package. I accepted because I trusted DJ with his inputs and the assistance he was offering.

Thus started my Quant preparation. It was an arduous task completing all the modules. But, in hindsight, going through the grind is what brought solidity to my Quant preparation. The most important aspect to tackling Quant is having a 'structure' to the preparation and e-GMAT provided me with that 'structure'. The modules in e-GMAT platform ensured that even the smallest of chinks in my Quant armour was identified and strengthened.

If you're still reading this review, now is a good time to steer away a bit and help you exercise your brain: Let's say I ask you the formula for calculating Simple Interest, if you answer I = (PRT/100), where P = Principal, R = Annual rate of interest, and T = Time in years, then good on you. What if I asked you the formula for Compound Interest? If you jump up the seat and say, = P(1+(R/n*100))^nT, where n = Compounding period, then well, you are incorrect because the expression, P(1+(R/n*100))^nT gives you the Total Amount (A). Hence, the interest I = A - P. These were the nuances that I previously did not understand that e-GMAT helped me comprehend with much clarity. Each of the e-GMAT modules is well designed to give this conceptual clarity for all topics. In addition, the Quant course also ensures that we apply 'Process skills' to solve problems. These skills are important because, at times, it's not our inability to apply concepts, but our incapability to retain certain question imposed constraints, such as not considering all cases, not correctly translating the question prompt, etc. that prevent us from getting to the correct answer. Each question on the portal and its associated explanation illustrates the usage of concepts and process skills. When these two aspects - Concepts and Process skills - became second-nature to me, I gained the confidence to tackle Quant without much difficulty.

Around this time DJ helped me upgrade from Scholaranium 1.0 platform to a Scholaranium 2.0 (Schol. 2.0) platform. On having used Scholaranium. 1.0 platform previously, I was privy to both these platforms and their differences. For one, the Schol 2.0 platform is AI driven. It shows you a detailed analysis of your performance in each quiz, mapping how well you performed in each question as compared to your peers, the time taken by you compared to the median time taken by others, presence of any luck-factor while you solved questions/ questions in which you paced fast without giving enough time, etc. These features helped me readily analyse my performance and start off with the next steps.

Once I completed both Quant and Verbal courses on the e-GMAT platform, DJ suggested that I give the Test Readiness (TR) quizzes. He laid out a comprehensive plan for me on the number of topic-wise questions that I should attempt in each quiz, and the accuracy that I must target. He also told me to write to him after each quiz to ensure that I'm track to doing the right set of things - revising concepts, reviewing Error Logs, etc. These TR quizzes helped me gradually transition from answering quizzes that contained 10 questions to answering full length quizzes (31 questions for Quant and 35 questions for Verbal). Performing well in each of the quizzes became important and DJ ensured that I didn't lose steam in the process. Through these quizzes, he helped me fix glaring 'timing issues' and identified areas that required extra attention.

Once I satisfactorily completed the TR quizzes for both Quant and Verbal, I took my second Sigma X mock after 5 months (since my first Sigma X mock) and scored a 690 (Q49, V38). DJ then enrolled me into his Mentoring program for more nuanced inputs. We then had a conversation about my performance on my mock. For instance, in Verbal, DJ helped me identify that I was faltering in RC, while in Quant, he helped me identify that I was faltering in Algebra and Geometry. He then suggested the next steps to fix these issues to ensure improvement my performance on my next mock. After implementing these suggestions, a week later, in my GMATPrep Official Mock, I scored a 730 (Q50, V38). Two days later I gave my Official GMAT and scored a 730 (Q49, V41).

The past year or so has been challenging. However, in hindsight, it has been worth it. A major reason for my performance has to do with e-GMAT Test prep products and the tireless back-end team that always responds to queries. Special thanks to DJ - the mentor who helped me all the way through, Stacey and Shraddha - the SC experts who answer all queries with crisp and concise explanations on the e-GMAT forum and not to forget Harshvardhan - the CR and RC expert who tirelessly gives exhaustive responses on the e-GMAT forum. A big fan of these folks! While these are the people that I have named, there are countless experts that have played an instrumental role in my preparation behind the scenes! Heartfelt gratitude. :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Since my applicant pool (Male, Engineer, Indian) is a very competitive one, I knew a score of 630 wouldn't get me anywhere. I read a lot of reviews about different courses, but after watching several debriefs on Youtube, I decided to go ahead with e-gmat. I had a long call with Dhruv, their customer representative and he highlighted the fallacies in my approach to questions and the lack of a strategy/concrete study plan which is absolutely essential to ensure a good score. Post the diagnostic mock, I was quickly connected with an SME who analysed my performance and formulated a study plan for me - 
Big Wins - 
1. The Master comprehension course sets you up with the correct reading strategies and pause points. It may seem slightly boring at first, but this course sets the foundation for newer techniques introduced in further modules/
2. The Sentence Correction course - The meaning based approach triumphs all grammar rules - and this is emphasized by the course at every nook and corner. The answer explanations are extremely lucid and you can always contest these explanations in the ""Ask an Expert"" section.
3. The Last Mile Program - This was extremely beneficial for me. Post my mock performances (and overall performance in the quizzes), I was offered to be a part of this program. The program helps you in working on bulleted weaknesses such as ""SC questions with modifiers"". Your mentor creates a hyper-specific plan to cater to your weaknesses. This was a huge part of my preparation since I had fallen from scoring a 680 in my first attempt (GMAT at the test center) to a 610. Despite such a huge drop in my scores, I was not abandoned by my mentor and we continued to identify and iron out my weaknesses till the very end. 
4. Team's support - e-gmat's team are very prompt in replying to your queries. So if you ever get stuck anywhere during your preparation (low scores on cementing quizzes, custom quizzes or mock tests) do not continue attempting more questions. Write to the team about where you are facing a problem and they will get back to you with a good solution. There will be times when you feel hopeless or lost. You can write to them during such times as well. Just make sure to be proactive and keep in touch with the team.
5. Advanced Topics and Word Problems modules in Quant - I started with a Q47 and I had consistently scored Q49/50/51 in the mocks leading to my last attempt. Despite that, I loved the Advanced topics module (esp the Arrangements with constraints) and the Word problems (the variety of profit, loss and Simple/Compound Interest questions)
6. Strategic Review of error logs - Learning from your mistakes supported by data. You will be expected to delve into the reasons why you made such mistakes. Maintaining an error log along with Strategic review does way more than attempting two extra quizzes. I learnt a lot more and gained conceptual clarity by revising and re-revising my error logs.

E-gmat is the way to go if you're unsure of what you need to do to get to your dream score. Just follow their steps, and be proactive!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","0","0","","","","","",""

Especially grateful to Stacey for the in depth analysis and the kind of correction in directional approach she followed. 
E-Gmat was really helpful throughout the way and the Sigma MockX Tests, Scholaranium 2.0 and Personalised study plan were the final bits which completed my GMAT journey.
When I started with E-Gmat I had heard that such platforms offering pre-recorded videos fail to capture the personalisation aspect in students, however, E-Gmat proved these misconceptions wrong. The level of statistical personalisation I got was fantastic. The team could pin point each and every nook and corner of possibilities in concept confusion. They use data to plan your entire journey and they do it well!
The team at E-Gmat was especially very helpful throughout the journey. There was a hyper specific SC Improvement plan which was made for me with special focus on areas within SC such as Modifiers and Parallelism. The plan was instrumental in improving my SC Accuracy from 55% to 95% in less than 2 weeks! 
The team took special efforts to help me out when I reached out to them. They made a roadmap specifically for me, gave me analysis of every aspect of the Test including time expense analysis and exam taking strategies. 
The SIGMA-X mocks offered by the team are extremely accurate and on the spot in terms of helping out with pinpointing fault lines in preparation and direction. Further, the team pinpointed their takeaways of the mock performance in Custom Videos.

"October 17, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","E-GMAT: One of the better courses out there.","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","Before I say much about the E-Gmat course, I will give a brief account of my current circumstances to provide better understanding about how the E-Gmat course was well suited for me. I am a working professional with almost 9 years of experience. The reason I mention this is that I had not given a standardized test for almost 9 years. Hence, getting back into the game and striving to get a score needed a lot of effort since I had forgotten most of my high school mathematics and didn’t have the sharpness of a younger mind. Moreover, I have a full time job so I needed to make time for preparation on top of my professional and personal commitments. This may not be such a big deal for many but since I was starting from scratch on a lot of the GMAT concepts, this meant a great deal of cognitive flexibility on my part to come out of my professional “work life” mode and into my ‘test taker” mode. 

In my opinion, this is where the real strength of e-Gmat lies. e-Gmat is a course that is ideal to suit an online preparation format. Right from the system architecture to the feedback methods and various analytical tools provided, the system was perfect for me since I could not give fixed times of study every day. The advantages of online preparation are the flexibility with time and pace of the courses and e-GMAT executes this perfectly.

Firstly, the e-GMAT course material is designed in such a way that it tests your prowess in all the GMAT concepts from time to time to save as much time in preparation as possible. Always take the test, whether they are diagnostic tests, practice quizzes, application files… etc. The e-GMAT system is designed in a way that rewards success in the course by reducing the time spent on concepts we are aware and rewards failure by making sure the concepts we are weak in get sufficient attention. This is very evident from the Quant portion of the e-GMAT system. 

The Verbal section of the e-GMAT system is quite unique. e-GMAT’s meaning based approach to SC is definitely the best in the market. It brings all the concepts of grammar, logic, and vocabulary together in a concise and precise manner and all the application files make sure that we understand and apply this method well. 

The RC method is a bit lengthy I feel. The whole idea of making summaries is worthwhile but seems a bit time consuming in the exam environment. I feel this aspect needs a lot of practice from the student’s side. Although in all honesty, this approach did help me get out of my totally blank approach to RC. 

This brings us to CR, the real mindbender. While e-GMAT advocates an effective method of pre-thinking, its application though challenging is fine-tuned by Scholaranium. I think Scholaranium is a wonderful tool which provides a lot of good feedback for the student. No one is perfect at Scholaranium so do not expect perfect green bars with 90 percentiles in everything. It’s a tool improve score. Hence, use it extensively, attend to the weak areas again and again. That’s what Scholaranium is there to do, build foundations out of failures.

Finally, the Sigma X mock tests are quite accurate in their representation of the GMAT. In all honesty, my GMAT experience was quite humbling. At the start, we are all heroes in our own stories. Hence, we believe that we are infallible and expect 800 right off the bat. The Sigma X mock tests helped me come back to reality and understand the challenge but the analytics behind them was the real help which showed me how to take a successful test. I think what many students fail to grasp is that the GMAT is more of a test of planning your failures rather than concentrating on your successes. This is what the Sigma X mock tests can catch and show well through its data analytics.

Overall, the e-GMAT course is definitely the best for an online mode of preparation. It was the best for me with my busy schedule and numerous activities. Finally, I would say it was a marvelous experience and a joyful journey. Thank you for all the help, e-GMAT team.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","My tryst with GMAT began less than 6 months back. I was not confused with which training program to opt for as I have been around friends who spoke very highly of e-GMAT and dedicated their scores to its Verbal course. I immediately signed up, and I took up their Quant course as well since I  saw that their Quant 2.0 xPERT AI promised a score of Q49+ for those with the ability. The following paragraphs aim to highlight the specific reasons why and ways in which e-GMAT has worked for me and is sure to work for most non-native speakers of English. 

Though my entire education has been in the English language, as would be the case with most people who pursue GMAT, it was important to know that my control over the language is quite different from that of an average American professional. With that in mind, I started the e-GMAT course with a Sigma-X Mock Test and scored a 640 (V33, Q45). I reached out to the support team and they shared a Personalised Study Plan (PSP) with me, taking into account my starting sub-sectional scores across Verbal and Quant, and the amount of daily time I was willing to dedicate to the preparation. Note that one does not have to do this to get an effective PSP in place - the website is built with a feature where one can create their own PSP by inputting the aforementioned data. 

e-GMAT broke down Sentence Correction modules quite effectively and the course was structured in a very non-intimidating way. I did not have to deal with any complicated / complex grammatical terms that most other courses use. e-GMAT helped me approach SC questions in a very simplified way. The meaning based approach that they teach works every single time. Furthermore, the in-house of team of experts offer video solutions to most questions and that is pure gold. They take the time to dissect the question stem, effectively identify the errors and carefully eliminate misleading answer choices. I owe my SC ability entirely to e-GMAT's approach and video-solutions. 

CR has always been a difficult sub section for me to get through. I realised that one's abilities need not be high in all sub sections to score in the 90th percentile (overall) on the test. If the ability is high in all other sub sections, then a 90th percentile is possible by ensuring that the ability is reasonably good in the weak sub section. My improvement would not have been possible without e-GMAT's ""Pre-Thinking"" approach to literally all CR question types. Every question in the course takes the time to effectively teach this approach. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes hard wired and intuitive while solving any CR question. It makes you a better thinker for life!

The reading strategies that e-GMAT teaches are crucial for a good RC score. I would not have been able to perform well in RC had I not religiously followed these reading strategies. They also build your confidence to deal with any passage irrespective of what it speaks about. As an Engineer, I was uncomfortable with Humanities passages. As an Indian, I was uncomfortable with passages based on American Politics. I could effectively deal with both types by following the strategies taught by e-GMAT. 

Coming to Quant, I don't think there is any other course out there that gives you hyper specific data on your performance on quizzes and tells you what to takeaway from it. The difficulty level of e-GMAT's quant is reasonably high and rightly so. Neither the OG nor the Official Mocks are a true representation of the difficulty level one faces in the real test, at a Q49-51 level. The course is built in such a way that there are summary slides for every concept in every sub section so that the student can revise specific areas efficiently instead of spending excess time in redoing modules. 

Sigma X Mocks are a very accurate representation of one's abilities. The Official Mocks usually have a 30-40 point error margin but the Sigma X Mocks have a 20 point margin only. Further, Sigma X Mocks pretty much simulate data in an ESR fashion, with specific data across sub sections and overall too. Pro tip: hide the per question timer on the Sigma X Mocks as the main exam does not have it. This tip will help you manage time better - a crucial factor that can give or take 20 points on the overall score. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY - I have to thank Archit who was my mentor in the LMT (last mile training) program. e-GMAT chooses who to take in in this program, based on the student's dedication and performance across quizzes and Sigma X Mocks. Archit was super patient with me and helped me draft specific cementing plans that helped me bridge the gap in CR. He was my go-to person for everything related to the GMAT. Archit also helped me prepare for IR and AWA with some essential pro tips without which I could not have scored perfectly in these two sections.
Having this one person to consult with and be answerable to has definitely helped me work through day-to-day targets and pick myself up on days when I felt demotivated or defeated. Many, many thanks to e-GMAT for building this program! 

TLDR: e-GMAT is the best test preparation program out there. My satisfaction level is through the roof and I would not change a thing if I were given the opportunity to do so. Be diligent and hardworking, and e-GMAT will incentivise you with the LMT program. Once that happens, you can be sure that you will score in the 90th percentile.

The meaning-based approach for sentence correction and pre-thinking approach for critical reasoning definitely helped enter the 700 score bracket. I opted for the Quant package as well to leverage the Sigma-X mocks. The mocks are quite accurate and give a detailed analysis of the performance in different sections and help identify the weaker sections at a glance. 
I joined the mentorship program with Atreya as my mentor. He helped me fine tune the skills by identifying the exact weak topics and chalking out a timeline to achieve them. Having a set timeline and small set of topics to focus on helped a lot. Scholaranium for both verbal and quant is very useful and the fact that you can practice questions not just according to topic but also according to difficulty level and create your own customised tests is very useful.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","When I first started my prep for the GMAT, I started in the usual way of buying the OG and solving the questions there. Soon I realised that my accuracy on the OG was high and I wasn’t really learning anything new. To solve this, I started researching about online GMAT prep and came across e-GMAT. The main point for selecting them being the insights provided by Scholaranium and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. 

Firstly, my first interaction with e-GMAT started when I requested them for a study plan. They insisted that I go section by section and me beating me I said I’ll do both Quant and Verbal together. In hindsight, I know I could have saved a lot of time and effort if I would have just followed their simple advice. So everyone reading this, trust your mentor !!! They do this day in and day out and know what it takes to get a good GMAT score in a predictable manner. 

When it comes to the course, I used to rely heavily on how sentences SOUND before starting this course. But the structured way of teaching me to spot errors and the meaning based approach to understand what the sentence really wants us to communicate have been game changers for Sentence Correction. 

When it comes to Quant, the cementing quizzes really do cement the concepts and help you improve in the subsections. Do not repeat my mistake of not doing the cementing quiz immediately after the section. Following the strategy of Learn concepts and then cementing the concepts using timed quizzes will help you reduce the time you spend for your preparations. 

Further, Scholaranium and the level of granular data that it provides is what everyone needs for having efficient GMAT prep. It helped me pinpoint my weak areas to as granular as absolute values in Algebra or comparisons in sentence correction and helped me tackle that and improve my score. 

Lastly, a special shout out to Atreya Roy who has been guiding me and helping me get a good score on the GMAT. His support and advice has been extremely prompt. My emails to him have always been late in the day and I have always been shocked to receive his response with strategies to improve and focus areas even before I wake up the next day. In my first call itself he said, don’t hesitate to call/text if you need help even on weekends. This really shows the dedication that Atreya and the entire e-GMAT team has for helping you succeed.

Thank you once again !

																			by score report","","Location","My journey with e-GMAT was nothing but special during my GMAT Journey. I scored a 710 and was pretty happy with my score. Let me pen down a few learnings and how e-GMAT (especially DJ from the team) went about helping me in my journey.
Initially, I had issues in my Quant and had timings issues as well. If you are someone who finds yourself cruising in the first 10 odd questions but suddenly has 7 minutes for their last 10 (sorry for the exaggeration, but you get my point) – this was me. Exactly my situation. We figured that my ability to solve M-H questions wasn’t good and which is why I spent more time than required on those questions.
The solution? The Quant 2.0 course that e-GMAT offers. It not only gives you very clear instructions on your weak areas but also outlines next steps, in a very clear, crisp and concise way. In my opinion, if you are able to complete the Quant 2.0 course in a very comprehensive manner (without hurrying, skimming or rushing), you would have built an ability to score a Q48/Q49 – that’s how awesome the course is! From the xPERT AI tool, Diagnostic Files to help you pinpoint your weak areas, Process Skill files which help you build and cement your process, the course has it all required to ace the Quant on the GMAT.
Coming to Verbal, I was particularly strong in SC but CR and RC were my Achiless Heel. I used to jump into the answer choices with really no basis apart from the fact that it sounded right while eliminating. While this approach might get you a V40 on your most lucky day, it fails 99% of the time. (The GMAT is a very clever exam in that aspect). Pre-Thinking is a very important concept that I learned in the Quant course. Taking that extra 10-15 seconds to pre-think really changes the answer choices in your brain and CR and RC become more like a Quant exam – where you know for sure what the right answer is. Finally, add “Error Logs” to your artillery and you have a winning combination for Verbal as well. Maintaining Error Logs is really helpful and helps you identify your weak areas and where exactly are you making errors, helping you identify and rectify.
Finally, I haven’t spoken about any human element till now. After all, the most important functions in any equations are humans and I couldn’t have achieved my goal without DJ, my mentor at e-GMAT. He wasn’t just a great mentor and teacher but a wonderful person as well. From creating specific videos for me analysing my mock, giving me insights on my performance and even telling me to chill when I scored a 640 on my last mock, which was 3 days before my exam, DJ went the extra mile to ensure I was able to hit my goal. Infact, there was a time when I was so unsure of when should I take my exam that I panic-called DJ and very calmly he helped me out. He gave me a Day-By-Day plan for my last 10 days which was super super helpful! DJ – I salute you and your ability to help your students.

I had a wonderful experience with e-GMAT. In today’s world of Data and Analytics, this is the perfect course to help you ace the exam. When else have you had a software giving you percentages of what your weak areas are and what should you work on?","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my sincere GMAT preparation with a diagnostic test from Kaplan. As I wasn't prepared with anything I didn't want to waste an actual official mock but just get a baseline idea of where I was in the Verbal and Quant section. It was immediately clear that I was struggling with the Verbal and was already doing good in Quant. That's why I started looking for various courses that would be a right fit for me in Verbal. 

Before settling on buying the e-GMAT course, I tried a lot of free trials and attended webinars for a lot of other courses. But I really liked the course structure of e-GMAT and their approach to solving GMAT questions. 

I went with the e-GMAT verbal course and straight-up started with the Sentence Correction section. Sentence Correction was my weakest section and sometimes I was even struggling on easy and medium questions, so I didn't skip any files in the course and made proper notes. 

Looking back, I should have started with the Master Comprehension course as it is very helpful, especially if you're struggling with Sentence Correction or Reading Comprehension. 

However, I finished the Foundation Course on SC first and then went on with the cementing section for SC. I struggled with the cementing part of the course even after finishing the foundation course and was scoring only 50%. That was when I wrote the support team at e-GMAT and got a reply from Dhananjay. He suggested going back to the foundations, creating an error log, and trying to understand where exactly I was faltering. Once I went back, did some analysis and thorough revision, I was consistently able to hit 70%+ in medium and hard SC cementing quizzes. 

Then I moved on to Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension and finished the foundation courses and cementing sections for these two parts. 

After I was done with this, I wrote to the support team again after which I was constantly in touch with Dhananjay who gave me advice on my GMAT preparation. He started by asking me to work on my test readiness skills. That was when we figured I was struggling with time management on Sentence Correction and also hard questions on Critical Reasoning. Then, we got on a call and charted out a plan. DJ also gave me honest feedback and advice and set the expectations. 

 With DJ's help, I created a detailed error log to keep a track of all the questions I had answered wrong and to understand the root cause of the problem. This was done especially to focus on the difficult questions in SC and CR as that was what I was struggling with the most. Also, DJ figured out that I was lacking in the application of the meaning-based approach in SC so he asked me to go back to the Master Comprehension section and finish the last two modules in that section. He also gave me some links to videos where the SMEs like Shraddha and Harsha solved some SC and CR questions step by step to help me understand what was the step I missed. 

Overall, I can confidently say that DJ's mentorship throughout this whole GMAT journey really helped me to hit a score of 700+. I wouldn't have been able to get here in the short duration of 3 months without the constant support I received from the e-GMAT team. 

If you are a student at e-GMAT or are considering buying the course, I'd just suggest you to follow the e-GMAT's process thoroughly in order to get your target score. Trust the process and work diligently and you will get there. 

Many thanks to Payal, Rajat and DJ for all the help and support they offered in my GMAT journey. It was worth it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=62#","0","0","","","","","",""

The course is designed to transition you from a instinct based subjective approach to a very methodical and almost scientific approach to the verbal section. The meaning based approach foe SC, the pre-thinking approach for CR and the master comprehension skills to enhance your reading ability, have helped me remove any confusion in eliminating the choices. The quant course was a little too slow for my pace. Its good for beginners but if you have very stringent timelines like I did, then you might have trouble understanding what to skip.
I found the scholaranium questions to be harder than actual GMAT test itself. But it definitely helps you assess your ability section wise and prepare you well for official GMAT questions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=63#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","My GMAT journey has been super long. I purchased my first set of GMAT resources in 2018 but struggled to prep with my job.

In March 2020, I purchased Egmat on the recommendation of a friend and I can guarantee that it was the best decision I made especially when it comes to Verbal! 

The Verbal SC course is very well structured. The Meaning based approach though looks simple is very profound. I came across the other common approach - Splits approach - which many coaching institutes and courses teach. But I found EGMAT's approach much better. The RC and CR courses are very well structured too. The animations help register the concepts really well.

On the Quant side, one thing that I found extremely unique on EGMAT is the concept of ""Process Skills."" They have bucketed the processes we do while solving any Quant problem. This really helped me during my optimization phase.

Coming to Scholaranium - this I can say is THE most amazing part of the whole EGMAT platform. After a long journey trying many resources for practicing questions, I had to come one full circle back to EGMAT because of their amazing SCHOLARANIUM 2.0. It gave me clear insights about my weak areas and that helped me bump up my score

The support from EGMAT team is great. I reached out to DJ that I have my gmat in 10 days and he helped me with a clear specific plan of what to do. The plan was detailed to the level of what specific sections of the course I should be revisiting. I didn't have to think much and just execute. Overall it has been a phenomenal experience!!

PS: While I took GMAT online, I am not sure if that is the best option. I had a really bad experience because on my IR section there was a bug. The proctor had no clue and kept time running. And I lost 8-9 min out of 30 min. GMAT club has many other similar horror stories. So just take that into account. What I hear from few folks is that if you use a wired connection instead of wifi, the experience is better - but am not sure how does that cause/not cause a bug!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=63#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Background:-
I am someone who works on an average around 60 - 70 hours in a week.
I had attempted GMAT twice -once in 2019, when I got a score of 680 and -once again in Jan 2021, when my score actually decreased to 650. As with any engineer my strength was quants, but I struggled specifically in SC and CR parts of Verbal.
Major takeaways:-
1.Structured 3 stage Approach - This 3 stage approach - 1st Stage of learning the concept, 2nd of applying the learning and 3rd of mastering the concept - changed the way how I approached GMAT preparation. This seemed so very natural to follow.
2. Sentence Correction Course - This section to me was all about knowing grammar rules, many of which didn't make much sense to me. In GMAT SC is as much about applying logic as any of the other sections and that's the crux of how e-GMAT approaches SC. This helped me improve immensely.
3. Error Logs - The best thing about this entire course. You not only log the errors that you make, but also dissect the errors that you make. You exactly understand which parts of the 3-step approach are you failing to apply. For example, when I first started solving SC questions, even after taking the full course, I realized I wasn't intuitively pausing to understand the sentence, leading to increase in timing in solving the SC questions. I focused on improving that part and both my timing and my accuracy in SC questions improved greatly. 
4. Critical Reasoning Course - e-GMAT equips you to pre-think varied scenarios on any question and that helped me to improve my accuracy in solving difficult CR questions greatly.
5. Quants - Although I didn't go through the Quants course due to the paucity of time at the end, I solved quite a few questions and the questions prepared me well for the real game.

I will take this opportunity to applaud the entire e-GMAT team for the wonderful course that they have designed. This course helped me improve my verbal ability greatly and I will surely take the learnings from the course much beyond GMAT. 

At the end, I want to specifically thank my Mentor - Dhananjay Lowe, aka DJ. He kept pushing me to be consistent. And even after I was done with my exam, he went beyond to even tell me about various B-schools and how I should approach the next stage of B-school applications.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=63#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I prepped for GMAT while working in an incredibly busy start-up. Here is what I liked about the eGMAT Course.

Critical Reasoning

Throughout the course, eGMAT gives subcategories for each category of questions. For example, a question can be profiled as - CR → Assumption Based → A context-dependent truth being assumed as a generic fact. 

This helps you profile a question while you are reading it and make a mental note of what type of reasoning it probably is testing. This was incredibly helpful in CR. 

Their Pre-Thinking method is also a great tool for CR Questions.

Reading Comprehension 

eGMAT teaches you common structures of RC passages. This makes interpreting and skimming RC passages easier. 

Sentence Correction

Meaning based approach - eGMAT stresses on this a lot in their SC course, and it's a good model to have while solving SC questions. 

Quant

eGMAT has a great question bank in Quant 2.0 and Scholaranium 2.0 for Number systems and inequalities, which are heavily tested topics on GMAT.

Scholaranium 2.0 also gives you insights on which question types take you a long time to answer (which is worse than getting them wrong in GMAT)


One-on-one Support

Best thing about the eGMAT course is the one-one-one support in the LMT program. This was especially important for me since I was working with extreme time constraints. I worked with Atreya Roy. Atreya created personalised study plans to structure my prep, defined milestones, and gave me some important reality checks. 

Expert Team 
I would recommend  trying to get as much 1-on-1 interactions with the expert team. It can give you pointed advice that will help your score jump by 20 points just like that. I had hit a wall with SC. My conversation with Shraddha from the expert team was crucial for me.


Strengths - 

eGMAT is an expert on the GMAT. They know all the nuances and prudent things about the GMAT. This reflects in all their courses (except SC)
eGMAT Course is great for topics that you are really weak at. 
1-on-1 interactions are very helpful.
Subcategories of questions created by eGMAT are incredibly helpful.

Weakness - 

Course is extremely long and slow. I recommend only doing the parts that you are weak at, or you will waste a lot of prep time.
SC Question Bank doesn’t emulate GMAT accurately. I would recommend doing OG questions for SC preparation (also available in Scholaranium 2.0). There is just a different flavor to OG questions that no one can quite capture. Also eGMAT’s prescribed process helped me get better at SC during practise, but is simply too long and idealistic for the actual test.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=63#","0","0","","","","","",""

I got a 700 and was happy with my score, but had 3 more weeks in between jobs to try to improve my score. With only about 7 days on e-GMAT, I learned enough quant skills to get from a 700 to 720. If I would have spent 14 days, my score could have been even higher. The lessons are so thorough and you learn SO MUCH about approaches to tackling quant. I didn't focus on verbal because I did well on verbal and my score was very much lacking in quant. If you are trying to get this done in a time crunch, reach out to the team at e-GMAT.

																			by score report","","Location","I began my GMAT preparation in April 2021. At first, I did not plan to purchase any GMAT course but after around a month of preparation I felt a shortage of good questions and thus I began my research for a good GMAT course. I looked through all the options and took up as many free trials as I could. In the end, I found the E-GMAT course most appealing of all the courses as it was cost-efficient and provided a dedicated tool to practice the concepts(Scholaranium). Also, as I had already used the E-Gmat free trial, I was convinced that the E-GMAT course material is good enough. 

I only enrolled for the verbal section as verbal was my biggest weakness and I believed that I do not require any assistance with quant.

The E-GMAT Verbal course description:
The course is extremely detailed and covers all the aspects of GMAT Verbal. The course consists of Master Comprehension, SC, CR, and RC modules, and each of the modules is divided into three stages. E-GMAT according to your performance in Sigma-X mocks provides a personalized study plan. The course offers a ton of questions in the form of concept quizzes and application files as well so that you can practice the concept you just learned. These application files allow you to solve each question on your own and then provide a detailed explanation for the same. Additionally, E-GMAT teaches a simple yet efficient way to tackle each of SC, CR, and RC and this novel way definitely worked for me.

What I liked the Most:
The E-GMAT support team is the best feature of E-GMAT. Whenever I had a doubt on any question in Scholaranium, I posted on their forum and I got an answer in less than 18 hours. Apart from this, the support team helps with almost every query you may have regarding the GMAT. This personalized my preparation to an extent that I can't begin to describe. The support team deserves a huge shoutout for the work they do. All of them including Atreya, Shweta, Dhananjay aka DJ, and many more helped me tremendously in my preparation.

For instance, I fared badly in my first GMAT attempt, scoring just 700 and I immediately contacted E-GMAT as I was confused about whether to give another attempt or not.  In response, I received a complete questionnaire in order to find out what went wrong from Atreya, and soon after I was contacted by DJ. He consulted me regarding my score and provided insights as to whether my current score can get me an admit to my dream schools. This meeting was very helpful as it helped me decide to have another go at the GMAT. For my second attempt DJ provided a revision plan as well as various invaluable tips to improve my score. 

Overall the GMAT verbal course is great because of some key features such as Scholaranium, the support team, and the data insights that Scholaranium provides. Although there is just one drawback that you cannot access the Sigma-x mocks if you have enrolled for just E-GMAT verbal or E-GMAT Quant. Sigma-x mocks are accessible only to those who have enrolled in the E-GMAT Quant + Verbal course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=64#","0","0","","","","","",""

I took the e-GMAT coursework to help myself with the verbal section and i could see changes in my thought process to eliminate two or three close choices. The meaning based approach for SC questions did in fact come a long way in tackling difficult questions in which grammar played little or no role. For CR questions pre-thinking approach helps one create a situation in which one has an edge with the structure of the argument, even when one is not able to exactly figure out the assumption or pre-think the exact answer choice. For RC, I practiced a lot to overcome the fear of non-familiarity with the topic.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=64#","0","0","","","","","",""

1. Methodological and step by step approach

3. Promoting the creation of error log 
4. Well designed course structure. The process they follow is first test, then teach and then practice your skills in any particular area.  
5. They also conduct frequent webinar on not only gmat exam but also on business school application. 

I can't imagine getting a 700 score without e-gmat's support. Six months back when I had appeared for my first mock and scored a 610; I had no clue as to how I should go about my prepartion. The course content of e-gmat provided me confidence in my prepration.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took the GMAT online test in July and ended up scoring a devastating 590! I was shattered. I did not know what went wrong. I immediately wrote to e-gmat team. They sent me a set of questions to analyse what really went wrong during the test. They also looked into my schoranium data to figure out what were my weak areas. And I figured out that the test anxiety really got over me. My schoranium scores showed that I had the ability, but I got very very nervous during the test which ruined the entire test!! 
I took a day off and started over again. I looked into where I lacked. I followed the instructions given to me by Aditee (from e-gmat). Her detailed feedback really helped me to work on my weak areas. For example - I was not doing great in boldface questions in CR. In SC, I was always going wrong in comparison questions. I identified and worked on the questions from specific topics I lacked. And Scholaranium data helped my identify my weak areas!!
How E-GMAT course really helped me -- 
Starting with the Master Comprehension Course , I learned how to pause at specific points , read slowly and comprehend the meaning while reading. This technique really helps while comprehending long sentences!! Sentence Correction module is just mind-blowing. It is my favourite part of the E-GMAT course :)  It teaches the meaning based approach, which actually helps to solve the 700 level questions. With just the grammar rules, one can solve the lower level questions, but for solving the higher level questions, one really needs to focus on the meaning of the sentence. Pre-thinking approach taught in critical reasoning module works wonders. It is difficult in the beginning to pre-think, but once you are able to pre-think, you can solve a question very easily. 
The Scholaranium is a great tool to know your strengths and weaknesses and work on them. Please look at what the data is telling you!! If you are taking more time in solving a modifier SC questions, it means you need to go back to the modifier module and fill in your concept gaps. This is how I used the scholaranium to identify and work on my weaknesses. 
I took the GMAT online test again in September. This time I kept two things in mind. 1) TRUST YOUR PREPARATION 2) IT'S JUST ANOTHER TEST, NOT THE END OF MY LIFE :) And I scored a 710 :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=64#","0","1","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

I needed an average 700 score for the schools and program I was targetting. So I used to EGMAT tool. Here is a summary of my experience:
1) The video explainations were very good, though a little lengthy sometimes but going through the material increases your stamina to sit and focus for longer so it is a win win
2) The feedback loop after each prepartion step is very helpful. 
3) I made it a point to go through each explaination as the approach matters, especially in quant. Also the review by other users helps, so after a while I could develop my own style of solving the questions.
4) There were neat little messages sent in the email that would champion me, in case I missed or hit my target. Those really help maintain the rhythm.

Eventually by accepting the pointers and feedbacks and working long hours I scored a 690, which wasnt exactly 700 but I am happy:-) 

Knowing your own target is the most important as GMAT can become an addictive game but the idea is to learn how to learn and analyse and keep at it.

I would recommend anyone looking to take an online course to subscribe to the course early in their preparation.
e-GMAT also offers a mentorship program (not sure if that's the correct name). I worked with Dhananjay in the last 19 days of my prep and his feedback was quite helpful. Again this would have been more helpful if I had approached him earlier in my prep. 
I like how the course emphasizes on improving ability and does not promote gimmicks. Their meaning approach for sentence correction takes time to implement as a habit, but it works overall. Though they could definitely improve upon their material in the verbal section. In my humble opinion their material is not up to the mark. Though I could say the same about other programs after trying their free tests. 
Their ""Scholaranium"" question bank is of great value once you have exhausted the OG material and the Quant section is more closely aligned with the actual test than the OG.

																			by score report","Points","Location","E-GMAT is a great online tool to strengthen your foundations with respect to the Quant and Verbal sections of the GMAT. It is self-paced, and the learning modules is adaptive to your personal weaknesses and focus areas.

I signed up for the online course, after taking my first GMAT attempt. While, I had score decently on my previous attempt, I was looking to improve my score by 20-30 points, to target the more competitive US B-schools. 

After buying the product, I had emailed the E-GMAT team to help me with a personalized study plan to ensure my efforts were dedicated and focused on my areas for improvement. The E-GMAT team was prompt to assign me a mentor (Aditee) to guide me through this process. 

Since the beginning Aditee has been extremely helpful and dedicated to my success. After taking a diagnostic test, we came up with a plan to identify my areas of improvement, and device a learning strategy accordingly. 

I went through the Quant and Verbal learning modules, and used the Scholaranium platform extensively to track my progress, and cement my learning skills. Aditee was always there through the process to answer any doubt, and suggest improvement plans as per my progress. 

The SIGMAX Mocks platform is really helpful to mimic the actual GMAT test experience. While the Quant section is a bit on the tougher side, the Verbal section accurately reflects the actual GMAT. 

Both the Scholaranium and SIGMAX platform provide actionable analytics and data points to identify specific topics and areas of weakness. This really helps to isolate areas of improvement, and make targeted learning plans. 

Even after my GMAT attempt, Aditee went over and beyond to support with analyzing my ESR, summarizing our learning journey. Having someone guide you through this test prep journey is super helpful. 

Overall, E-GMAT is a really good platform, especially for someone who is starting their GMAT prep. Their mentorship program is really commendable, and I strongly recommend the E-GMAT service to prospective test takers.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=64#","1","2","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hello all, 

I gave my second GMAT on Aug26 and scored Q50 V35. My first attempt - Q50 V31.  As a working professional I somehow managed time and researched a lot on what does push my verbal to a perfect score. I literally went through almost all free sample verbal courses and its resources available online. I finally took a strategy session with E-gmat and understood this could help me. Below are my takeaways.

Pros:

1. Content - Solid content on whole verbal section especially in SC. One could actually say its the most comprehensive solution for ""SC"". It's SC is divided into 9 topics - 1 of which is on ""Meaning"" - this tells us how strong is the content in SC. 
The same goes for RC and CR too. The learning videos might be a bit long but getting a good verbal score do need that prep and e-gmat has done excellent job in getting the content solidified.  

2. Scholaranium : It has the most equivalent verbal questions in comparision with offical gmat especially in easy and medium difficulty level. It has almost 800+ Verbal questions to practice with the count growing everyday . 

3. Analytics : It's analytics is all we need to assess ourselves on where we are lagging and guides us we need to go back to learning phase. It is very intuitive and much needed if we dont know where is the specific lagging in Verbal section.

Cons :

Expert reply : The only thing that bothered me through out the course is while the explanation they give covers all the possible scenario's. In several cases when we reach out to them for the doubts - their replies are not convincing .
Also when users ask question in relevant scenario's the reply from e-gmat experts is ""As per e-gmat rules , we cannot answer questions that is not in e-gmat official curriculum or their question bank"" - this is something should be addressed being a leader in verbal courses. 

Conclusion :  E-gmat verbal content is super strong, however its customer reply service is frustrating at times and needs to be addressed by its management.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=64#","1","0","","","October 11, 2021","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Congratulations on scoring a 710. This score will give you a shot at securing an admit from many B-schools. We are also happy that we could help you in the process and also glad you loved our verbal content. 

As you rightly said, our expert responses are very thorough – they cover all bases, including giving you reasons on how to think about approaching a question, what to do in steps 1, 2, and 3. We also give you solid reasons as to why you should reject each incorrect option.

As a policy, we do not comment on questions created by other prep companies. For one, we don’t want people to practice those questions (note, we support all official questions) as we have no way to judge whether, given your preparation, these questions are even appropriate for you to solve. Second – we don’t want to open ourselves for litigation by commenting on questions from non-official sources. 

I understand that it is frustrating when you solve a question and are unable to get a quality explanation on why a certain answer choice is incorrect. However, if you have purchased the questions from a certain source, then it is that source’s responsibility to provide quality explanations (you have paid that source, after all) 

Overall, our goal is to help you succeed, and often, the shortest path to success involves practicing questions on e-GMAT and tracking the corresponding data.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Hello everyone,

I am Aditya Kumar, Mechanical engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur. I am working in an Oil and Gas Major for the last 4 years and planning to do my MBA in 2022

Although I am writing this review about my journey of GMAT preparation, I haven't reached my destination yet. I am still working to achieve my full potential and hope to get a 730-740 in future. 

I started preparing for GMAT in March- April 2021 and was very confident that 2 months of preparation is more than enough to get a 720+ score. Dont know why I was so confident back then, mostly because my friends from college and some colleagues had got 700+ and I thought I am better than them :P. But I didnt know that I had big surprises waiting for me. 

For my 1st attempt, I used only the offical resources for practice and Manhattan SC as additional resource for refreshing all grammar concepts. The preparation lacked discipline and structure mainly due to lack of guidance and also the covid situation which was at its peak in 2nd wave at the same time.

Although I had practiced most of the questions of official, I was not feeling confident about my ability. To check my ability and to verify my test preparadeness I bought official mocks and gave all of them. I scored 660 700 710 and 740 respectively, which seemed to suggest that I had the ability and strategy to score a 700+. Therefore after my last mock (740) I booked my test date and was super excited to give the official GMAT exam and complete this part of my MBA application.

Guess what ! I performed poorly and scored a 670 (Q49 V33) Even while giving the exam I could feel that i was not following any process, randomly marking a lot of ques and was not in the righ state of mind.
So after the completion when the screen popped up 670, it was not a surprise, to be honest I was expecting even lesser. I may have got a few guesses right I think.

So the strategy for my next attempt was very clear. First I need to identify my weak areas and then follow a structured approach. Based on the reviews on GMAT Club and some of the debrief videos on YT, I thought e-GMAT could be the right fir for me. So I reached out to e-GMAT and got a meeting with Karan who explained using the analytics of e-GMAT my weak areas, timing of ques, etc based on the mock i gave on eGMAT. To be honest, I was a bit fascinated by the insights that he drew so quickly and efficiently. I had never realised that we need to look at these many parameters to devise an effective exam strategy. I made up my mind to take up the e-GMAT course for 2months and e-GMAT was kind enough to provide a mentor to me to monitor my progress and guide me during the preparation.

So I started working with DJ, my mentor during mid July. The things we identified to work on were :-
1. CR :- I was taking a lot of time in CR and also was not following any process to solve the ques. I did all the concept files followed by the Cementing quizzes where I had to clear a certain threshold of accuracy for going to next step. DJ was very peculiar in asking me to make detailed error log as per e-GMAT strategic review.
2. RC :- Although I had decent accuracy in RC, I still followed the comprehension methods suggested by e-GMAT which helped me improve my comprehension ability. The error log which I made was reviewed by Harsha and he provided a detailed analysis on ways I could do better error logging and also on improving my ability on inference based ques.  I feel the insights shared by Harsha were very helpful and really made my RC prep efficient
3. SC :- Although I was confident enough in SC and didnt do the concept files, I still did error logging as per e-GMAT strategic review and was able to narrow down my mistakes.
A big mention to Shraddha for making a video reviewing my SC error log and giving insights that I would never have taken into account. 

After around 40-45 days of verbal prep and also doing quant questions (weak topics identified during the discussion with DJ), I felt the need to give a MOCK test to test my ability. So I reached out to DJ and he replied with a strict NO. Although I did not agree with his decision :P, I still followed it since he has been working with a lot of students and definetely knows much more than me about test preparation strategies.

DJ shared a test readiness plan with me, which I feel was the most critical part of the prep. According to the plan, I had to give multiple tests in each subsection - SC, CR and RC get the minimum accuracy, then only move to the sectional test (all 36 questions in 65 minutes).  This was a real gamechanger as after going through all the concepts and practice I knew I have the ability to solve, but didnt know the best way of timing myself in each sub section and creating an best working strategy for the verbal section. The custom quizzes in Scholaranium was my ultimate source of practice during this phase.

After going through the test readiness phase, I moved to the sigma X-mock. I found the quants to be a bit tougher than official, but verbal was exactlly to the point. I gave 1 mock in every 3-4 days and analyzed all the questions irrespective of right or wrong in the same error log module that I used during prep. By the end of my prep I scored a 750 in sigma X-mock which fuelled me to book a date for my 2nd attempt.

Although my second attempt did not go as planned and I faltered in areas which had actually become my strength by the end of the prep, I still managed to score a 700 (Q49, V35).

I am analyzing my ESR with DJ now and hopefully will be able to edit this review in future. 

Till then cheers and keep preparing !

Thanks

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","First Attempt 670 (Q-50,V-30)
I started of my Prep for GMAT around November 2020. In the initial days of my Prep I used only the GMAT official content and GMATClub for my studies. After giving 2 mocks(640-650) in a span of 1 month, I realized my scores in weren't improving at all I was stuck around V27 and 28 and had some major flaws in my concepts in sentence correction. After talking with  few of my peers, I booked a session with Egmat to get a review on my preparation and they made me realize that I do a lot of scope to improve on my verbal skills. They even gave me a peek through the egmat platform. After going through similar calls with different services and some reviews from my peers I decided to  go ahead and buy the egmat subscription. In the next month of my Prep using the egmat platform I learnt about the right approach to solve any SC or CR and how to eventually save on time by making this approach a habit. I Gave my first online attempt in the month of Feb and score a 670 (Q-50 and V-30). 

After few weeks of introspection, I realized that during my prep I didn't concentrate much on learning from my mistakes. I used to prepare the error logs but never took them seriously or read them properly and in repeated the error. Considering that I Still have time left for my applications and my score can be  improved I took on to give my second attempt.

Second Attempt 660(Q-49, V-31)
Before starting any of my prep I first gave the 1 Sigmax mock and scored a 690. This made me realize that Yes I can score good on the GMAT. I just need have some patience and work effectively. Considering my learnings and the type of data analytics provided by scholarenium on egmat. This time I went straight to Egmat for assistance with my Gmat Prep. Seeing my SigmaX mock score and the potential to improve Egmat assisted me a mentor Dhananjay(DJ).Before beginning any of my prep, I connected with DJ and discussed with him what I feel are my weakness , where did I fail in my first attempt. DJ Carefully listened to me and then assured me that we can work together in bits and pieces to overcome my weaknesses. We started of with RC prep. Realizing that Humanities is a major category I faced issues in, DJ advised me to read through articles on Humanities of WSJ , The Washington Post or NYT and draw a summary of those writings in my words. Initially it was too boring to read such lengthy articles and drawing summaries from them. But as I made this my daily habit I could see my RC scores improving and the time taken to solve a RC also decreased . After tackling RC we moved on to CR and SC. DJ helped me design custom quizzes to concentrate specially on my weakness and made me Strategically review each and every quiz even if I got all my questions right. The strategic review process developed by Egmat helped me understand the smallest of the errors I was making like not visualizing the answer choices properly or not creating sentence structures for a SC and helped me avoid repeating those errors. With the help of the scholarenium platform I was able to visualize what Question Type are my weaknesses . After consecutively scoring a 730 and 740 in my sigmax mocks and official mocks, DJ advised me to go ahead and book a Date for my GMAT since I was peaking my performance.  I went on and booked a GMAT at Test center for 11th August . I gave my 2nd attempt and scored a 660 (V-31, Q-49). I had gone completely blank during my Verbal section and couldn’t think properly on applying the proper approaches to the question. Seeing the score drop from my first attempt I was completely dejected. I took a break for a day and convinced myself that it was just not my day and I deserve much better scores. I ordered my ESR and had a session DJ to understand what went wrong and how to prepare . He helped analyze my mistakes and gave a short plan on my reattempt. 

Third attempt 710 (Q-49, V-36)

This time I decided to my attempt within 2-3 weeks, since I was already doing well and just had few mistakes to work on. I took on solving questions from GMAT Club and writing few mocks and scored an 730 and 720 .  After gathering the confidence I went on to book the GMAT for 7th Sept and scored a 710 (Q-49, V-36).


A huge shoutout to DJ and the entire Team at Egmat. DJ, has been like a mentor who motivated me when I was getting anxious before booking on my GMAT dates. After failing on my second attempt I was completely dejected and was in no mood even to order an ESR, But DJ pinned me 2-3 times day via mails that I should at least order  ESR and have a look at my mistakes, that’s when I gathered courage to go ahead and take a 3rd attempt. Egmat has been really helpful through-out my Journey and course is really very well designed especially for Verbal. The Scholarenium platform and the Strategic review process have been really helpful in spotting errors perfectly and working on them. GMAT is an exam of Learning from your mistakes so getting your error logs and the Strategic review process right is the key success.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I am from India, and when I started my GMAT journey, I was advised to take help from a personal tutor. I used the service of a very expensive and experienced tutor but could not increase my verbal score. After studying with him for almost 3 months when I scored only a 720 in the GMAT, I realized that it is not the right approach for me. 

That is when I decided to trial few online courses, and settled upon E-Gmat. I will go as far to say that e-gmat course's knowledge base and customer support gave me 10 times better quality of service at literally a 10th of the cost of a personal tutor. 

When I started my course with e-gmat, I already had a 720, but I was clear that I need to get at least a 750 to be competitive in top B-Schools. I reached out to the e-gmat team and they considering my past scores, ESR reports, and on-going performance in their system, and gave me a personalized study plan to follow. Please note I just took the basic course and did not pay anything extra for study plan guidance provided by them. 

I decided to re-do my verbal course with e-gmat, and thoroughly enjoyed the clarity of concepts, user interface, and apt examples which really make sure that verbal studies are fun and not a headache. 
For quant, I didn't do the entire course due to paucity of time at my end, but I went through the practice questions - which I would say are unmatchable in terms of quality & quantity. 

Lastly, their mock tests are top notch. I took a mock test right 1 day before my exam and scored a 750, which is exactly what I scored the next day in real GMAT.

For anyone who is hesitant to use an 'online' learning platform, I would say that subscribing to e-gmat was the best decision in my GMAT journey from 720 to 750. If you are capable of getting a good score and have the time, you do not need an expensive tutor.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","2","1","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

After this, I followed their Verbal and QA course rigorously for a month or so based on my sectional requirements according to me. After my second mock, I was offered the e-GMAT Last Mile Program, which is a 1 to 1 mentoring program. This is where I came in touch with Archit, who studied my performances till date and came up with a 4 week plan to tackle my weakness (specifically SC). In the time to come, I created different error logs, revised them and solved questions in the form of quizzes regularly from the massive pool of questions from the Scholaranium 2.0 of e-GMAT. These questions are very similar to what we face in the actual exam and the best thing is the explanation that follows.

Throughout the course, there were different techniques that I learnt about; pre-thinking, reading strategies, process skills etc. to name a few. Then come the Sigma-X mocks. These mocks are a good representation of the actual test in the sense of their choice and difficulty of questions. These were helpful to gather insights after each milestone of preparation completed.

Talking about the mentorship program, Archit was there to help me with personalized plans and videos throughout the main month of my preparation. SC was one of the weak points in my preparation and he pointed that out, followed by a plan of action to tackle it. He identified QA to be my strength and suggested steps to bolster my score there to the maximum.

Lastly, I'll recommend e-GMAT to anyone who has a plan to ace the GMAT, as it has the necessary resources irrespective of the level of the candidate appearing for the exam. It can help you fill conceptual gaps, have enough practice and gain test readiness all in one package.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","0","1","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Background
I didn't know what the GMAT was comprised of before Dec'20. I had appeared for CAT before but I had very low confidence on my Verbal ability. Working full-time, I was really concerned about the selection of a right platform that could help me achieve a good GMAT score and that would allow me to do so at a self-determined pace. A few of my friends, who have already excelled at GMAT recommended e-GMAT, and I started my journey in Dec'20 with the e-GMAT online intensive course.

Approach
e-GMAT course has been structured to identify the areas of improvement right from the beginning, so that a huge amount of time could be saved using the detailed analysis of each of the subtopics. Each of the subtopics of both Quant and Verbal is structured around a three-step learning process: (1) concept, (2) process, (3) GMAT skills. This method allows one to be certain of the readiness to move to the following step, and to calibrate the time dedicated to each subtopic in a very personalized way.

Platform
The Scholaranium is an excellent platform which is unique of any product out there. It provides as many metrics as one can imagine to identify the process flaws and knowledge gaps at a very detailed level to know exactly what to do to improve. It keeps track of the results for the different levels of questions. With Scholaranium, one can design custom quizzes and can even choose at the subtopic level! Especially, one can design a quiz comprising only of Medium and Hard-level questions on any topics within each sections of Verbal or Quants. The explanation of how questions should be solved correctly and in a timely manner is very detailed and allows one to identify what went wrong or to confirm a correct.

Sigma X Mocks
I found the Sigma X Mocks to be closest to the actual exam. The adaptive software makes the experience very similar to that of the GMAT. From my own personal experience, I can say these mock exams even have more difficult questions than the GMAT, which allows one to be confident that when preparing for this hard questions, one is for sure covering the difficulty that will be find in the exam. In my best Sigma X Mock I scored a 730 (Q49 V40) which translated into a 730 (Q49 V40) in the real exam.

My study mentor: Archit
Perhaps the most important thing that makes e-gmat different from the other platforms is the support that one receives from the mentors. My GMAT mentor, Archit, helped me formulate the study plan and helped me at each and every step, whether it was identifying the weak areas during the concept building exercises or it was analyzing the various GMAT mocks to identify the corrective actions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","When I had applied to the ISB YLP, I wasn't expecting even a Round 1 shortlist. It was only in Round 2 that a GMAT score was required. When the shortlist email came, my first thought was panic. I had exactly 2 months and 3 weeks before the August 31st deadline. I started researching about the best way to study for GMAT in 2 months - with a goal of crossing the 700 mark somehow.

First Impressions :
I tried the e-GMAT free trial for a week. What sold me instantly was the pre-assessment quizzes for each individual topic. For example, if I wanted to study Absolute Values, I could give a short pre-assessment quiz of GMAT type questions to check my ability. This saved a lot of time later on as well, where I could just skip/skim through topics whose questions I could solve. 

SigmaX Mocks :
I gave my first free mock, where I got a 510 (Q30 V31). That immediately pointed out to me what my weaknesses and strengths were. I had to work on Algebra and Sentence Correction questions. I was doing okay in Geometry, CR, and RC. After I finished analysing this mock, I bought their course, because the clear direction it gave me (in terms of my weaknesses) was invalable.

Learning/Teaching Approach :
The learning approach e-GMAT follows feels very scientific. They first measure your current ability, based on which they recommend modules for you to study, finally follwed by a post-assessment quiz which shows you your improvements. Their focus is on increasing the ability to solve GMAT type questions first, not on general accuracy  - which is a great metric because ability automatically improves accuracy in the Medium-Hard questions.

Verbal :
Their verbal is a bit lengthy if you follow every single video. While it did help me visualise the sentences better and break down what the question was asking, I personally could skip many of the basic lectures and complete only the guided question solving files.
For someone with low confidence in verbal, it will help you visualise the problems GMAT throws at you in a more structured manner, and approach it in a step by step way. I would recommend the course with great confidence. Also, note that questions in verbal seemedto me harder than actual GMAT questions/

Quant :
The subject I had to spend a month perfecting. It took a long time but again, the structured approach to teaching it helped me immensely. The best thing is that they take questions that are so similar to what the GMAT expects you to solve, due to which you're not wasting time doing unnecessarily easy/difficult questions in the beginning.

Summary :
After 2 months of prep (3-4 hours a day), I finally got a 690 (V39 Q45). I will be giving a second attempt soon, and will continue with e-GMAT. Go for it if you (a) want to maximise a short prep time by focusing on only some topics in depth, or (b) you have 6 months at hand and can utilise their course completely. In eiter case, you will see improvement - I am sure about that.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","The whole GMAT prep has been a roller coaster ride, and E-GMAT has played an integral role in the journey. I had used the product in the past around Oct'20 but did not leverage their support during that time. The product in itself is a complete package especially scholarinium, which gives you detailed knowledge of your weak areas, timing issues, and performance comparison with other students. It really helped me to self-pace my study. I will not get into how good is their product, because that has been covered my most of other folks in the reviews out there.

I reached out to E-GMAT support in Jun'21 after I score 710 on GMAT, but the score was revoked after my complaint about the issues faced during the online GMAT exam.  I was in a hurry so I took another attempt without following the complete instruction sent by the E-GMAT team. I scored 680 this time, and it was in person exam at the center. That was really heartbreaking since I had scored 710 already and knew that I could do better.

This time I got on a call with DJ (GMATNinja of exam strategies). It was a half an hour call, and we went through my 680 ESR. He pointed out timing issues and other weak areas. I will admit that whatever he said was simple advice, but I never really focused on those issues diligently. He prepared a plan based on my weakness, and I religiously followed it. The step-by-step plan made by DJ helped me focus on areas such as RC, geometry and etc. really boosted my confidence. I reattempted the exam and scored 710. Again, a few technical issues which caused a delay of 1.5 hr in the middle of the verbal section and some other technical craps.

One piece of advice for most of the folks is that please utilize the platform as well as their mentorship/support to the greatest extent possible. I felt that the support is really good and prompt and helpful in keeping you on track. 

PS: I am planning to reattempt the exam around Dec before second-round deadlines, and I will definitely reach out to the e-gmat team before starting the prep.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","1","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I started using E-GMAT's verbal course about a month before my exam. I wasn't sure that I would learn a lot in a month, but because I was panicking about my SC prospects I started the course nonetheless. So here's my experience:

1.  Even though I had already trained myself on SC topics, and had done quite a few official questions, EGMAT's SC course still had a lot for me to learn. 

2.Each topic is broken down into smaller consumable parts and explained with great amount of detail. In fact I thought that they were very thorough in anticipating doubts that a reader might have.  

3. Overall the questions of a certain difficulty level, especially in the question bank SCHOLARANIUM, are more difficult than the  official ones of a corresponding difficulty level. And this I think is a GREAT thing. As you are forced to read and comprehend longer sentences and pay attention to complicated details. By the time you are done with Scholaranium, you will most likely cruise through official questions (at least most of them).

4. Ofcourse as you solve official questions you will also encounter errors that you haven't come across in E-GMAT. But you will, for most parts, be able to wrap your head around them by making connections to concepts that you would have learnt through E-GMAT. 

5. Don't expect to get all official questions right by doing a E-GMAT course (that's true for any course). There will always always be questions that will stump you. And therefore I think one should be realistic. Rather focus on consistently getting the easier and medium level questions correct. If you do them well, you will most likely crack enough hard level questions to reach V40 and above.

7. Scholaranium has great analytics too. So you can actually find out pretty precisely the topics that you might need to work on. 

6. I didn't have time to complete their RC and CR modules so I cannot comment on them. 

8. Overall, if you aren't very very very confident about SC, and are struggling to find a good source on which you can put your faith in, then I recommend you try E-GMAT. I know that it is difficult to make a decision on what to trust, given that there are so many products in the market. I went through the same dilemma. But ultimately I think I made the right choice for SC.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","0","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hey there!
I have had a rollercoaster ride while studying for my GMAT. Initially, I did not want to spend on any course. I thought I was ""smart enough"" to self-study (and I still believe that). In fact, (full disclosure) I even reported e-GMAT's ad on YouTube in order to hide it from my account.
Started with a 690 (Q50 V32), which was a pretty decent starting point. One month of OG and bam, still 690. I consulted my seniors who had aced the GMAT, and from them, I got the notion of error logging and practising hard questions from GMATClub. This really helped me shape my understanding of questions and even improved my verbal score from V32 to V37. I once got a 730 on my GMATPrep and thought that if I simply continue with the error logging, I will break that 750 barrier. However, I stagnated again. Instead, my score dropped to 710 (dropping one point each in Quant and Verbal), meaning that the 730 was a score on a good day. This is after over 3 months of GMAT study. In my head, I was thinking, ""This is taking way too much time, and I do not even know what I am doing wrong"". I had already gone through GMAT Ninja's videos and solutions (which are GOLD, btw) and diligently worked on logging my errors and practising tougher official questions everyday. But V40 STILL seemed out of reach.
I sent an email to e-GMAT (yes, I had the gut to mail them even after I blocked their ads on YouTube :P) and I got a response within 5 hours, on a Sunday. Not gonna lie, their promptness moved me a bit. I had 2 calls first in order to discuss which e-GMAT program would be suitable for me. Bought the course for a month and started right on, hoping to keep a fresh and open mind.
I realised my SC, which I believed was great, had some particular conceptual gaps because of which I was missing Medium questions on SC. RC was actually great, thanks to a reading of The Economist articles for 2 weeks. CR was conceptually alright, but the timing was super bad (3 mins on average!). I had never timed my practice - I used to do a question, reflected on why I got it wrong, did a thorough review (20 mins/question) of that question, and only then moved on to the next.
e-GMAT courses really helped me structure the process of learning. I was not wasting time on WHAT I should study. Rather, I was spending time refining my process. The SC modules are awesome for someone who prefers video lessons over textbooks. I also got guidance from their mentorship program (A big shout out to Atreya and Arathy for all the help). Atreya guided me on what to do next, and took to my concerns. Yes, there were times when I would not get a response, but he went out of his way to get back to me.
Scholaranium, their practice platform, is where I worked on my CR timing. In fact, I even improved my timing on SC. It is something that I realised while practising on Scholaranium that I could say to myself, ""Oh, ok, I should approach the problems this way"". The biggest realisation: Read slow. Like a 5th grader. Literally. (Thanks to Gin's RC tips and a free e-GMAT video on RC strategy). I applied the same to CR and SC, and I was amazed at the improvement in my timing.
Of course, these improvements will be specific to your case. What to takeaway from this review is that invest in a course. Sure, you are brilliant and can self-study. But these courses are designed to minimise the time that goes into the prep. By the end of 5 months, I was burned out (even after the e-GMAT courses). I had to re-take the actual GMAT (first score was 700) because of something at the test center that distracted me during my Verbal section. I had to re-take even after I had gotten 760 and 770 in my mocks. Something unprecedented like this can really affect you. I am surprised to get a V40 even after all the wear and tear and a stupid sickness on D-Day.
Another thing is, if you decide to take e-GMAT and are invited to their mentorship program, please be nice to your mentors. They handle a lot of students (which might lead to less attention to some students, frankly). But they work like hell to help you out. You do not want to get a good GMAT score at anyone's expense. Being nice to them actually motivates them to work harder. 
All in all, e-GMAT has a great course. Had I not been a miser in my first 3-4 months and bought the course already, I would have been in a mental state to hit 760 or more on the actual test (and I mean it). 2 months of e-GMAT can really get you there, provided you have a good starting point. All the best to anyone who takes up the course! (Sorry for the long post!)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=65#","1","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Hi everyone, 

I am writing this post to walk you through my GMAT journey in the hopes that you might find it useful. At the very onset, what I have written is not meant to be prescriptive. It is a record of my experience with the GMAT exam and how I prepared for it - if, through this post, you can find even one idea that helps you in your journey, I would have done my job of giving back to the gmatclub community. I have broken this story down into three parts: 1) choosing a study plan, 2) preparing for the GMAT, 3) leading up to the test and the test experience. 

Before that my daily schedule (high level):

Wake-up: 6:30 am 
Sign-in at work: 8:00 am 
Sign-off: 6:00 pm.
Work Out and Dinner: 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm. 
GMAT Prep - 9:00 pm - 11:30 pm

Choosing a Study Plan 
I decided to take the GMAT in May this year, hoping to apply to business schools by the first round of deadlines in September. I knew a few folks who had already taken the GMAT, so I reached out to them to learn about their prep journey (read quite a few posts from the gmatclub - all very helpful) - a few suggested Manhatten Prep, some suggested Math Revolution, and some others suggested e-GMAT. Everyone who suggested the e-GMAT course raved about its verbal infrastructure and how that was especially important for non-native English speakers. 

I chose the e-GMAT because of its strong verbal infrastructure. I knew I had a comparative advantage in verbal over the others, because of my background in public policy. I develop and analyze policies for a living, so CR and RC are, in a way, a part of my job. I had also done my research and knew that breaking the 41/42 mark on the Verbal section in the GMAT exam increases your score substantially as long as you are hitting a Q48/49. Since my undergrad is in economics and I also do a fair bit of data science (for fun), my quant skills are decent. So I wanted a course that could complement my existing strengths and help me break the V41/42 threshold. I set a V45 target for myself.

Before starting the course in June, I took an official mock test to see where I stood. I started with a 650 - Q44 and V35. I realized I was relying too much on my instincts on SC. And while your instincts can serve you well (depending on how strong your foundations are in verbal), they won't take you too far when you start getting those hard (>700) type questions. My accuracy on >700 SC questions was abysmal, and I knew that was holding me back. e-GMAT treats SC like science and breaks down each sentence into various components - one then analyzes each component independently to see if they fit together well. Does the meaning of the sentence make sense? And if it does, does the grammar fit well into it? Once you can comfortably answer those two questions, picking the right answer becomes easier. 

Preparing for the GMAT
I input my mock test scores on the e-GMAT diagnostic report and they gave me a plan for the next three months. I tweaked that plan to suit my own goals. So through the course of the three months, I spent 70 percent of the time on Verbal, understanding the ""science-like approach to sentence correction"" and 30 percent of the time on Quant. 

For SC I started from the very basics - what is a sentence and built on my prep from there. For every module, e-GMAT starts you off with a pre-assessment quiz. This tells you where you stand before taking the module. Then after you complete the module, they do a post-assessment quiz to show you how far you have come. The ""pre-assessment, prepare, and post-assessment"" structure was very important for me since I got to see my progress daily. 

I would study the module, take the post-assessment quiz and then attempt 10-15 OG questions daily. Once you complete each module on the e-GMAT in its entirety, you can take ""cementing quizzes"". These quizzes are there to test how far you have come and how well you understand the concepts you have studied.

For RC and CR, I read 4-5 articles a day from the economist on topics I was not used to such as geology, and other sciences. I did not dedicate as much time to learning the basics of RC and CR but spent a lot of time doing mock questions daily. In addition to the 10-15 SC questions, I would do around 3 RC and 10 CR questions daily. You will notice as you read more your RC and CR automatically improve. That said, if you are not a reader then e-GMAT does have some very helpful tips on tackling RC and CR too and they follow the same ""pre-assessment, prepare, post-assessment"" structure here. 

For quant, I focussed predominantly on the word problems section since they make up for the most number of questions on the GMAT. The section is broken down into topics, and each topic starts from the basics. Once you are done with the concept file, you take post-assessment quizzes and see how well you understand the section. I would often couple my preparation with about 20 questions from the OG daily. 

Leading Up To The Test and The Test Experience

Through the course of my prep I took four mock tests: 
June (before starting my prep) - 650: V35, Q44 (official test 1)
July (mid-July, a month into my prep) - 740: V42, Q49 (official test 2)
July (last week) - 690: V38, Q47 (official test 3)
August (1 week before my test) - 720: V41, Q48 (official test 4).
I never attempted the AWA or the IR sections of the official mock tests. I would suggest you do. Doing so will give you a good sense of the entire exam and how long it takes. Also, IR and AWA can be tricky for some people, and you don't want any surprises on test day. My third mock score threw me off a little bit, but my performance was a function of how I was feeling that day. I had not slept well and was tired. It is important to know what you need in terms of prep for test day to be your optimal self. In my case, it is a good night's sleep and a light breakfast. Another important factor (for online test takers from home) is to prep on a whiteboard with markers. Make sure you are comfortable using a whiteboard before test day. Using it for the first time on test day can be detrimental to your performance. I started working on a whiteboard 2-3 weeks before my actual test. Small things, such as the smell of the marker, being used to erasing after solving 2 or 3 questions, getting used to the feel of the board, etc. may seem minor but can prove to be useful on the test day. 

My actual test day was alright. I logged in 15 mins before the test was scheduled to start. The proctor checked my room through the camera and performed the formalities and I was on my way. My last tip to you would be to start your exam with your strengths. The GMAT allows you to structure your exam the way you like. Always start with the section you are good at. That sets the pace for the rest of your test. Imagine not performing well and moving onto the next section - you are already demoralized. So you might not be your best self in a section you would otherwise ace had you been happy and confident. Now imagine starting strong - you are happy and confident with your performance so far, you move to your relatively weaker section but because you have done well so far, you perform better than you would have as a disappointed test taker. That is the approach I take - does not mean it is correct. 

Remember, the GMAT is just an exam and you can take it multiple times (ideally you would not have to but not doing well is not the end of the world). Also, it is just one of the many factors in a bschool application (assuming you are applying to bschool). If you don't do as well as you would have liked, IT IS OKAY. Be honest in your preparation. Be kind to yourself. And you will do well :) 

Final score - 760: V47, Q48, IR5, AWA6

The course is very well structured and takes you through all the concepts necessary to score the 90th percentile in GMAT. Working diligently on the e-GMAT practice files and application files will ensure that you pick up all the required skills to ace GMAT, right at the time of learning the concepts. The cementing stages and strategic review further helps to fill any gaps left during your study. The course structure has been further aided by the use of analytics such as xPERT to give you targeted inputs to improve upon. Such targeted feedback has been extremely beneficial towards the end of my preparation to fill the gap between my score and the target score. 

The Quant section of e-GMAT may be slightly on the harder side but nevertheless provides you the confidence and skills to solve even very hard questions on your actual GMAT.

e-GMAT also helped me through one on one mentorship by creating hyper-specific improvement plans, once I was test-ready. This helped me maximize my potential in the run-up to the GMAT and I'm extremely thankful to DJ for working with me on this. He gave me strategies and weekly targets that helped me immensely in the final leg of my preparation. Overall, I'm quite happy to have made the decision of choosing e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=66#","15","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Before I signed up for e-GMAT program, I had heard about it from few of my friends. So, once I made up my mind to appear for the exam, I browsed through their website and got in touch with the team. As per their advice, I appeared for a SIGMA-X trial mock and got 700+. Basis this score, I was enrolled for a mentorship programme, which allowed me to have a 1-1 guidance from one of the mentors. Following is my experience with the content and the team:

1. Sentence Correction - It truly lived up to its reputation (as I had heard from my friends basis their personal experience). I found it quite detailed and engaging. This content helped me to attempt SC questions in an objective and critical manner, thus improving my accuracy, time and confidence.

2. CR & RC - While these may not have course content as detailed as SC, they offer a very decent overview of question types and help to cement concepts with step-by-step detailed application modules.

3. Scholaranium - I found this an excellent platform to build one's ability and cement conceptual understanding, before moving forward to next concepts. This platform offers a nice overview of current performance and helps to work on one's weak areas as required.

4. Quant Course - The Quant content is quite comprehensive. A new update to this content, called Quant 2.0, has added a lot of practice files, a key requirement in Quant section, thus helping student to cement concepts in the respective sections itself.

5. Mentorship & Support team - I can't emphasize enough the great team e-GMAT has (including the general support team). With great content available, this team brings in their expert guidance and analytics (unique to every student basis his/her profile - current performance, target score, timelines). My mentor was Ashutosh, who was quite approachable and friendly. He used to propose a day-wise plan for me and basis my progress and performance, he used to adapt the same.

As I reflect on my entire preparation journey, I would highly recommend e-GMAT to new students looking for right content and guidance.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I followed the e-GMAT intensive study plan. I started with Quant and later continued with SC. After four months, I have really seen enough. What I am gonna say now will definitely upset some people, but I have talked to multiple people with the same opinion about the e-GMAT course.

For quant, the course certainly goes through all the relevant topics on the GMAT. However, there are multiple flaws:
(1) The practice questions are often unrealistic, nothing like the official questions
(2) The explanations to the solutions are often very confusing, and the comments section provides no real background to the reasoning behind a certain approach to a quant question. I feel like it is more about solving a particular question, rather than actually understanding the underlying concept.

For verbal, the course is even worse imo:
(1) The question quality is bad, really bad. Prove for this? One week before my official exam in which I got a 740 (Q48 V44), I took a SC diagnostic test from e-GMAT and had 3 out of 10 questions correct. I received a V44, and I am sure my verbal didn't improve that much within a week. In official questions I normally got at least 9 out of 10 correct, but the unofficial questions from e-GMAT really do not resemble the official questions.

(2) The ""pre-thinking"" approach for CR almost killed my CR ability. I really had to ""unlearn"" the approach later! After I used different materials (I will introduce that later), CR was probably my strongest section on the GMAT.

I could say many more things about the e-GMAT course that I didn't like, but I think I really wasted 3 months for this course. After 4 months I took another diagnostic exam and got a 530. Not very impressive after 4 months of almost full-time study. e-GMAT really has some strong marketing and it also got me. They throw around with fancy words like, SigmaX mocks, Scholarinium, AI, data-driven, and all this blabla..really, a test prep company that truly generates impressive results doesn't need such words for their marketing. Additionally, the success stories are impressive, but e-GMAT has hundreds if not thousands of clients. Obviously, with such a large sample there will be some great success stories. But for the majority of students I do NOT recommend the course at all. To improve your score, use TTP. For more details, refer to my debrief on GMAT Club: https://gmatclub.com/forum/gmat-debrief-from-a-470-q31-v24-to-a-740-q48-v44-369195.html","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=66#","28","24","","","","","",""

The course materials provided by E-GMAT are very elaborate and covers each and every type of questions one can expect. Quant modules had lots of practice quizzes and excellent video lectures. After completing the quant module, after a long time I started having the confidence to get a good score in it. Even the mock tests started reflecting the improvement in the scores. The verbal section was also detailed. I saw a huge improvement in the critical reasoning section and applying the pre-thinking logic served as the backbone of it. Even the sentence correction modules proved to be of great help. Scholaranium provided by E-GMAT had a great pool of questions. The hard level quants questions seemed to be more tough than one might usually get on the test but that in-turn made me find the difficult official mock questions easier. There are custom and customized quizzes for regular practice and they helped me a lot. Overall, I would highly recommend any GMAT aspirant to take E-GMAT course.

																			by post count","Points","Location","When I was thinking of signing up for a GMAT prep course the most important consideration for me was the quality of the mock test being provided. After trying out the free mock tests by more than 7 test providers, the eGMAT Sigma-X mock tests stood out (more on this below).

As it turns out, one cannot just buy the tests standalone and hence I signed up for the entire eGMAT course. However, little did I know that this will be a pivotal decision in my GMAT prep. After taking the first Sigma-X mock test I requested an analysis of the same by one of the eGMAT experts to identify my weak areas. That was the time when I was introduced to this legendary godsend Dhananjay Lowe!

He helped me analyze my test and with his experience and analytical mind he was able to interpret the same data in a way that I could have never done myself. DJ made an action plan for me and asked me to go through the entire course as I has some process gaps and skill gaps. Talking about the course and each subsection:

1) SC: I know some of you may have come across eGMAT's prethinking strategy for CR as their USP. However, for me it was the meaning based approach for SC that was the game changer. I absolutely loved the way they emphasize breaking down the sentences into clauses, understanding the meaning of the sentence (Meaning >>> Grammar), identifying all the errors in the OG sentence, and coming up with an answer before looking at the options. I can't emphasize enough on how wonderful this 3 step strategy is.  With the help of the hyperfocused custom quizzes, DJ's guidance, and eGMAT's Scholaranium I was able to make SC my strongest (from the weakest) sub-section in Verbal.

2) CR: The pre-thinking strategy (as some of you may already know) is a proven full proof approach to solving any question of any difficulty level. It does take some time to become second nature, but when it does you stand to reap massive benefits out of it.

3) RC: This used to be one of my weakest sub-section and I tried possibly every trick in the book to improve this myself. However, it was only after I followed DJ's advice and his proprietary ""RC pill"" that I could see an improvement not only in my score but also in the confidence with which I could approach a RC passage / question. Not to forget the drastic drop in time that I observed while solving RC passages. Lastly, the AI driven Scholaranium data helped me identify my exact weaknesses (eg: passages related to Humanities, Economics, BioScience, etc) and thus I could channelize my time and efforts to focus on just those topics.

Quants: The recently launched Quants 2.0 is probably the most comprehensive quants curriculum out there. The AI driven engine ensures that students are spending the optimum amount of time on the course and suggests the right steps to fill the conceptual gaps. I personally felt that the Scholaranium questions are slightly tougher than the actual GMAT questions. But again its a good thing to practice hard questions so that the exam is a smooth sail.

Sigma-X mock tests: As previously mentioned these tests beat all the other test providers by miles. Not only because of the quality of the questions, but also because of the supremely detailed post test analysis. They drill down into every single aspect of your test whether it be your block wise timing or sub-sub-sub sectional weaknesses.

Scholaranium 2.0: The best just got better!

Dhananjay Lowe (DJ): As previously mentioned I credit my entire success to him. My score may not have been something that both us desired, but it was nothing short of immense pleasure working with him. The best thing about him is that he is so very invested in your journey and success.  His ever willing nature to help the students is something that never ceases to amaze me!

Vipul (Quants SME): I was struggling with my Quants a little and DJ proactively looped in Vipul to help me cross the finish line. Vipul crafted yet another hyperfocused study plan and used to provide me feedback on literally each and every incorrect question. He taught me the importance of maintaining an error log and I could see an improvement in my performance and confidence in a short span of 15 days!

Bottom line (in case you made it through this very detailed review): eGMAT and Dhananjay Lowe are a one stop shop for all your GMAT needs. All you require is diligence and having faith in these two, and I'm sure you all can achieve your dream score!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=66#","16","2","","","","","",""

I was not going anywhere in terms of improving my skills in the SC section and I was struggling with the approach to be taken for tackling the section when my friend suggested this course.
It is a self-paced course with a great number of interactive elements. All topics start off with a pre-concept quiz to test your knowledge, followed by the course content in the form of short videos and ending with a post concept quiz to check the improvement in understanding.
The best part about this course is its division of concepts into small videos with short exercises at the beginning and at the end. It gets easy to maintain focus in short spurts. And most importantly, the concepts are put to use almost immediately after learning them.

Another highlight of this course is its logical approach towards language skills. All concept and practice questions are approached using a fixed framework that surprisingly fits well in all kinds of questions and aids in improving speed/accuracy.

I would strongly recommend this course, especially to Indian Engineers.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=66#","16","2","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I came across e-GMAT when I saw a success story video of a student, who had improved his score by over 80 points. Since then I have watched close to 50 such success stories and seeing those stories I knew that e-GMAT will help me succeed as well. My journey with e-GMAT was about 4 months long and it ended with me scoring a 770(Q50, V45) on GMAT online.

What I loved most about the course?
Structured Approach for each module:
Unlike other courses, e-GMAT gives you a structured method that needs to be followed for solving each SC, CR and RC question. For both SC and CR there is a 3-step approach that needs to be followed. Initially it takes students extra time to solve questions using these approaches but with regular practice, the approaches become second nature to the student, aiding the student on exam day in a situation of high anxiety and pressure. 

Depth and Breadth of SC Course:
I always struggled with SC but with e-GMAT's SC course almost anyone can score in the 90th percentile. Obviously the Meaning based approach is a game changer, but I would like to bring attention to the 200+ SC concepts that are covered in the e-GMAT course. Once the meaning is understood it is absolutely crucial to know the pertinent grammar rule clearly and the e-GMAT course covers every such rule. Many courses only focus on the common error types and hence students of such courses fail to understand usage of different sentence structures.

e-GMAT support:
One thing every student from e-GMAT will highlight is the personalization at every step of the preparation. I was given a personalized study plan basis my performance on the diagnostic Sigma-X mock. Whenever I had doubts during my preparation my mentor Archit Bhargava was there to help. I would just send in an email and I would get a response within a few hours. Without this constant support, I am sure to have spiraled off my preparation.

Scholaranium 2.0:
The most impressive thing about Scholaranium 2.0 is the explanation for each question. The explanations are in written in line with the structured approach thought at e-GMAT. The explanations are absolutely crucial because only when a student knows why exactly he/she got the question wrong can he/she learn and make sure not to repeat the mistake. The explanations also make it very easy for students to create accurate error logs.

Sigma-X Mock Accuracy:
High quality mocks are very essential to any student's preparation. In the past I relied on the official mocks from mba.com but even those mocks seemed to be of lesser difficulty in comparison with the actual exam. The Sigma-X mocks simulate the real exam experience and gauge a student's ability accurately. Also, the data driven results from Sigma-X mocks help students to focus on the areas required and fine tune their approach.

Personalized Analysis and Support:
I was invited by Archit to join the Last Mile Program(LMP), a program in which Archit would constantly monitor my progress and suggest further steps. I am sure that without Archit's support I would not have achieved my score and I cannot thank him enough. Timing was a huge issue for me and Archit made me see how I could better manage my time. He analyzed my performances on the Sigma-X mocks in the form of videos and suggested hyper-specific practices to improve timing. His personalized videos helped me improve my timing issues easily.

Overall, I would highly recommend e-GMAT for anyone appearing for the GMAT. The all inclusive course, the data and the mentorship provided make e-GMAT the best available GMAT preparation company out there.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=66#","4","0","","","","","",""

First things first, they changed my approach towards the test itself. It helped me immensely in formulating my study plan and testing strategy. Proceeding ahead, I started with absolute basics in verbal. Once I got the fundamentals clear, I learned the meaning-based strategy and that helped me eliminate the wrong answer choices based on more subtle meaning differences. Those lessons and the practice quizzes proved really valuable.

Once I got the hang of all the concepts, I practiced questions in Scholaranium of all difficulty levels. Overall I found it very challenging, but the more you bleed in preparation, the less you bleed in battle. I improved my timing in Scholaranium by roughly 10 seconds per question, which had a huge impact on my ability to finish all the questions in time in the actual test.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I had initially prepared only from the official guide and a few advanced GMAT Club questions, but my GMAT Prep score hadn't budged a lot from the 740 GMAT Prep score that I had got in my first attempt without any preparation. I then realized that I needed something that would point out specific areas of improvement and help me work on them. I then signed up for the eGMAT last mile program course, and here are the several ways the course helped me:

1. A key struggling point for me was SC. I simply did not know the rules because I hadn't studied any sort of theory in depth. The self learning modules of eGMAT solved this by giving crisp rules of SC, and as a result I started achieving 80-90% accuracy in every test thereon. 10/10 would recommend if you are struggling with SC.

2. The second area that I was struggling with was time in Verbal. This was mainly being driven by an average time of around 140 seconds in CR questions, although with decent accuracy. The eGMAT experts helped a lot here by going a step beyond and taking out time to address my issues specifically. It turned out that there was a flaw in my approach towards CR questions, making my method very inefficient. Next, I could cement the correct approach through the practice questions.

Specifically it was Harsha (Verbal Expert), and Aditee (Mentor) who guided me through CR, enabling me to cut down at least
15-20 seconds on my time.

3. The Sigma-X mocks were of a huge help as I could accurately see where I stood in terms of my performance. The level kind of matched the actual GMAT questions. My last score on the third mock was 760, which was very close to my actual score of 770.

4. The explanations of most practice questions (~80%) was on point, but even if it wasn't, you could get your doubts answered. Although, areas of improvement for eGMAT here could be their TAT (which sometime stretched to over 3-4 days) and the quality of replies of a few of their experts. 

5. The most important thing by far was the detailed analytics that eGMAT gives out for your performance on all questions. This was of a huge help since I could see where exactly I was struggling, and what was the low hanging fruit for me to improve. This is something that is extremely important for people who want to push their score that extra bit.

TLDR: I was pretty happy overall with the eGMAT Course. Within a month it helped me identify weaknesses and work on them, and gave me that much needed improvement of 30 points.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","9","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","After I decided to take up the GMAT, I was looking for a perfect course that would help me achieve my goals. I watched a few webinars of E-Gmat and also took the opinion of some of my friends. Finally,  after a lot of research and reading the reviews in GMAT Club I decided to enroll in the e-gmat course. First, I signed up for a free trial just to check it out. I felt very positive about the way the concepts are taught and signed up for the full course. I would like to say about a few things which make e-gmat the best course online.

Verbal:

SC - Hands down, e-gmat is the best in this aspect. The SC concept videos, application files, and practice quizzes are so helpful in learning the concepts. Visually, the style of animation and the pace of teaching will make you get immersed in the content. The detailed explanations in the application files and practice quizzes really help the student in understanding where he/she went wrong. Particularly, the meaning-based approach is so brilliant that it increases the student's accuracy to the next level.

CR - Previously, I had little experience in critical thinking questions while preparing for CAT but I always used to stumble in some questions. I did not know why a particular answer is right and why a particular answer is wrong. The egmat rethinking strategy helped me in this aspect. Again, the explanations for every question are on-point and help us to think in the right direction.

RC- Again, this was my weak area during my CAT preparation. I did not know what to do about this. That's when egmat came to my rescue. RC Key Reading strategies taught in the egmat course helped me cross this hurdle. I always used to try reading the RC fast and then answer the questions but it is not the right approach. Egmat RC strategy explained how we must take enough time to understand the passage, take notice of tricky little details, and map the passage on the whole. This helps in reducing the time taken to complete the passage as a whole along with questions. 

Verbal Scholaranium:
I must say this is the best practice arena for a student who wants to master the concepts of verbal in GMAT. The custom quizzes, ability quizzes, and cementing quizzes help us in identifying the gaps in our concepts. I particularly liked that if we don't score above 75% in medium difficulty and above 55% in Hard difficulty questions, then we need to watch the videos again if possible and go through the application files. This particularly helped me for my second attempt. I identified gaps in my concepts and worked on them.

The quant course if done right will fetch you a Q51 for sure. I can assure you that. The diagnostic quizzes, the concept files, and the practice files are very well structured that the concepts get cemented in your brain. I will recommend the egmat quant course for anyone weak in quant. 

SIGMA-X Mocks:
Sigma-X mocks come very close to the actual mocks. Though they do not follow the same algorithm by the official mock, they are adaptive in nature. They point out the weak areas where you can improve.

Also, the kind of support we get during the entire preparation journey is awesome. Our queries are answered at the earliest. Most of our doubts get solved by the already existing comments under each question. 

Last but not least talking about the LMT Program, Atreya helped me in the final leg of my preparation. He identified the key areas where I was lacking and helped me with personalized plans and strategies to get to my goal. 

Finally,  I would say egmat is the most structured preparation course I have ever enrolled in.  Prepare diligently with the help of this course and success is guaranteed.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","7","0","","","","","",""

The thing that stood for me the most were the CR and SC videos on the website. They are very carefully curated and use the best examples. The tests within the module also are good and have very detailed explanations. The query resolution is very fast (in my case ~7-8 hours).

But the crown jewel is actually the verbal and the quant scholaranium. These are very good practice resources and are a little difficult than the actual GMAT. These problems very well capture the essence of the concept and have very good and detailed explanations (Some have 12-17 min detailed and comprehensive explanations).

The Sigma-X mocks are good practice and have some useful insights too.

All in all, i felt that EGMAT was worth every penny and earns my highest recommendation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","7","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Instructor","I came across eGMAT when I attended some of the free webinars hosted by them on CR and RC. After attending those webinars and taking the free sigma mock, I booked a strategy consultation with their expert. I decided to enroll in the course as I really liked the analysis of my cold mock provided in that call.

Through the analysis, I knew that I had to focus more on Sentence Correction than on the other verbal sections. So,  I went through all the concept and practice files for SC and followed the meaning-based approach to solve questions in Scholaranium later. eGMAT’s SC curriculum is very extensive and helped me get a solid grasp of the major topics asked in the exam.

After SC, I moved on to CR and went through their videos in which they mainly taught how to apply the pre-thinking approach to solve questions. Initially, I used to focus only on accuracy and used to take a lot of time in solving questions with this approach. Once I was able to get good accuracy, the timing gradually improved on its own with practice. So I would advise anyone starting with CR to trust in the process and not worry about timing yourself in the beginning.

I did not spend much time going through the concepts of RC or Quant and started using Scholaranium to attempt ability and custom quizzes. The level of analysis provided in Scholaranium is simply great.  I was able to use the portal to effectively identify the areas in which I was weak and fine-tune those areas by revisiting concepts or practicing particular types of questions I was frequently getting wrong such as Boldface or Modifiers. 

Sigma-x Mocks provided by eGMAT are very good estimators of the actual exam and may be considered more accurate than official mocks. The verbal section is of almost the same difficulty level as the actual exam’s section whereas Quant could be a little bit tougher than the actual exam(Quant of official mocks is a lot easier than the actual exam). Also, the mocks are adaptive and you get an ESR-like analysis of every mock. 

Apart from their study material and tests, eGMAT also provided one-to-one mentorship and paired me with Atreya. The mentorship was objectively the best part of the course as he not only provided me with weekly plans but also helped me analyze my mocks properly. He also encouraged me to schedule the exam sooner when I was not confident that I was fully prepared.

The eGMAT portal is also very well made and I did not face any difficulty or encountered any bugs while using the portal. The support on the “Ask an Expert” forums is also very prompt and I always received replies in less than 24 hours

Overall, I would genuinely recommend eGMAT for anyone appearing for the GMAT for their great tests, course material, mentorship, and support.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","8","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","After about 2 months of self-preparation using the OG as the bible, I took the GMAT. I had thought that I would be able to force my brain to learn the algorithm of how to pick the right answer simply by solving hundreds of questions, training the neural network, as it is called in this age of AI. I was disappointed as I scored a 680. 

I had not given up hope but could not improve much because I was stuck to the ""Solve More Questions to Get It"" strategy. One day while scrolling the web I came across e-GMATs website and instantly booked a meeting with a strategist who pointed out quite methodically that one of the main problems in my strategy is that I don't have any solid foundation. He explained how e-GMAT could solve that problem (especially in verbal). That was an eye-opener and I jumped on-board.

I would want to list down the the most important points in my GMAT journey to a 730 score with e-GMAT.

1. One of the most important factors was Atreya. He was my mentor in the Last Mile Program who helped devise hyper specific objective based preparation methods so that I do not aimlessly go through each and everything. Atreya analyzed my performances consistently and kept pushing me to improve by focusing relentlessly on the areas which require improvement. This worked wonders as I was able to sharpen my SC and RC skills in almost no time. Thanks Atreya.

2. The course material by e-GMAT is fabulous. It is by far the best way to learn any concept. My verbal skills improved from V33 to V41 purely because of this learning methodology whereby you read about a topic, understand the underlying process, solve some questions to completely grasp it. In no time it becomes your second nature. The process skills imparted by the e-GMAT course is simply unparalleled. I cannot emphasize enough how important the process skills are for SC and prethinking for CR and e-GMAT is the best platform to hone these skills.

3. The Scholaranium 2.0 is their testing platform where you can cement your abilities by creating different types of quizzes. The analytics it gave me about my performance were deeply insightful and the wealth of questions it had was more than enough to have a good handle on any section.

Combined with Atreya's tailored guidance and seamless experience using the scholaranium and course material, I would say e-GMAT does what others would take years to do. Highly targeted and scientific approach to learning for a specific goal. Go for e-GMAT for accelerated improvement of your GMAT Skills.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","5","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Shweta helped me a lot to understand what my week points were and how should I go about improving the same. Shweta was always super supportive on both academic and emotional quotient

Her verbal diagnosis was on point and really helped me narrow down on what was important for me. The course content was relevant and gave great mental models to solve with. The content was up to date and the type of questions covered were exhaustive.

Some pointers on the course overall:

SC is very detailed and special at egmat; Concepts were precise and you are just required to apply them to the real GMAT questions (nothing more nothing less)
I had previously used other resources and coaching notes but the difference with egmat was that they only focus on what is actually asked in the exam and not random concepts. This helped reduce a lot of stress for me and kept my game plan simple; High focus on a meaning-based approach was unique and honestly the most important skill in solving hard questions

RC course is also pretty exhaustive and structured, practise questions are brilliantly designed and actually super engaging; The nuanced paragraph reading techniques are novel but very effective.

CR is also very well designed for everyone, the pre-thinking approach was a game-changer for me; The hard level questions on the platform were very close to what I saw in the exam - this was super helpful for my test readiness.

Loved the quant curriculum as well; The hard questions are really stimulating and thought-provoking. The solutions provided were detailed and really helpful for my conceptual growth
The 24/7 forum support was beautiful and actually saved me a lot of time; The overall question bank is the closest you can get to real GMAT experience

The sigma mocks were great and scholaranium was an amazing tool to track and monitor progress. I would recommend this course to everyone and special thanks to Shweta for his support.

I highly highly recommend egmat and specially Shweta for anyone looking to score 700+ on GMAT","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started with the GMAT Preparation way back in 2016, when I enrolled myself for an in-class GMAT preparation course. The course was for about 2 months, and I spent another 4 months trying to figure my way to at least a 700 in the official mba.com mocks. After about 6 months of preparation, I was confident about Quant (I anyway have an engineering background, so Quant wasn’t an issue) and SC. With absolutely no approach, I faltered majorly on CR; I wasn’t clear on the reason to eliminate the incorrect answer choices, and even after looking through the solution, I got really confused between the answer choices. I anyway booked a test date because I thought my Quant, SC and to some extent the RC section will get me at least a 700. On the test, I took really long to answer the SC question, so I had to leave 1 RC passage completely, and as expected faltered on the CR section; hence, scoring a 660 (Q49, V35). 
Fast forward to May 2020, when I decided to retake the GMAT. I took the e-GMAT course, and spent considerable amount of time to understand the concepts and learn the strategies that could be applied to each question in Verbal or Quant. I was surprised and relieved to know that there is a platform that has decoded the strategies for how to approach each question in the Verbal section, especially the CR questions. e-GMAT gave me the concepts and strategies that built in me the confidence to get the approached questions right. 

e-GMAT strategies 

-	The SC course is extremely well structured and details out all the grammatical concepts that one would require to get a GMAT SC question right. The meaning based approach emphasised by e-GMAT makes it easier to solve the harder level questions.

-	e-GMAT helped me tackle the section that I absolutely hated –CR. The concept files gave me a well- structured approach to solve any CR question that comes my way. This approach helped me score a 98th percentile on my GMAT exam. The course provided me with a process to break down the argument into premise and conclusion, to create a falsification scenario, to pre-think, and to correctly analyse answer choices. I was better able to comprehend the information and analyse how each particular answer choice affected the argument. 

-	The reading strategies taught as part of the RC and MC concept files helped a lot to improve my ability to comprehend the passage and arrive at the correct answer choice

-	Quant course gives all the concepts required for the test. E-GMAT’s quant questions are a little harder that the official GMAT questions, preparing you for the 700+ level questions on the exam. The solutions are very detailed and easy to follow. Because of the hard level questions that I practiced on the e-GMAT, I was extremely confident when I approached the quant section in my exam and was able to manage time well, with 5 minutes to spare at the end of the section

Mentorship by DJ
After I restarted my GMAT prep, I needed someone to guide me through the process and suggest me how best to plan my study schedule given a hectic job. I had already read a lot of positive reviews about how he helped students get to their targeted GMAT score, and so I was elated when I got to know that DJ was assigned to me as a mentor. He was a constant support and motivated me throughout the process. He analysed my Sigma-X mock test and highlighted how I could improve on my weak areas in both the Verbal and the Quant section. DJ provided me with a structured approach and weekly plans that included reviewing certain concept files, giving cementing quizzes, and creating custom quizzes to be solved within a time less than the standard time (This helped incredibly with managing my time on the test). He also shared the section wise error log, which is worth all the efforts it takes to fill it. The error logs give you an indication of the repeated errors one makes and suggests a corresponding corrective action, ensuring that you do not repeat your mistakes.
Skill Data on the e-GMAT Platform – The best way for you to analyse your performance
I first bought the e-GMAT course in May 2020, and again in March 2021, and I was surprised by the updates to the platform. Scholaranium 2.0 provided all the possible data points that one would need to analyse the areas of improvements. The skill data provided distribution by difficulty levels, time, concepts, median time, etc and this was incredibly helpful because then I could focus specifically on topics that needed improvement.
Takeaways: 
-	It all comes down to applying what you have learnt. I have seen myself getting a fairly easy question wrong because I failed to apply the strategies suggested by e-GMAT in its course. On the other hand, I could easily solve extremely complex and hard to understand arguments, by using the step-by-step strategies. 

-	I started with the GMAT prep again in May 2020, completed the course by August 2020, but then my GMAT Prep was on-and-off for about 6 months because I switched jobs and wanted to concentrate my efforts entirely on the new projects. This was a HUGE mistake. In January 2021, when I decided to get back with the Preparation, I had to start all over again. Hence, taking breaks between your preparations is a very bad idea and you will just end up exhausting yourself. It will double the overall time and effort required for you to reach your targeted score, so one should be consistent with his/her preparation.
e-GMAT is the best source for your GMAT Preparation and I would highly recommend it. I have already recommended e-GMAT to everyone who has spoken to me personally about the GMAT exam, and I hope this review helps you make a decision about the GMAT program that will get you to your targeted score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=67#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Egmat has very carefully curated content that has all the relevant aspects of the exam covered. The allied services offered by Egmat to ensure your exam success are also commendable. I finally scored a 770 on the GMAT that I gave in August 2021. 

I shall list down the relevant positives and negatives:

Positives:

1. Value for money: The course is much cheaper than any other GMAT Prep company of comparable content quality. The course also covers IR (which is often absent from many such GMAT prep courses).

2. Thorough Verbal Course: The verbal course covers all bases. It is comprehensive in every way possible. The Master Comprehension module is a great starter and the course flows from SC to CR to RC in a seamless manner. Initially, a lot of candidates lack the patience to read a long RC passage (atleast I was very impatient back then and used to get bogged down by a complex and/or long RC passage) and the logic of administering SC followed by CR and finally followed by RC is a great strategy, in my opinion. SC course added the most value to my preparation (I did not know the relevant rules, nor was I very skilled at intuitively identifying the errors) by providing me a systematic way to approach questions. With time, the process was not really something that I needed to ensure for myself, it came naturally just after reading the stimulus. CR provided me a new way to approach the questions (prethinking is very important for Assumption, Strengthen questions otherwise you'll waste a lot of your time and you might end up getting the question wrong). RC course is ok to just go through, I did not follow it through-and-through.

3. Good Quant Course: Quant course is good as well. The summary pointers help a lot. For most Indians, I believe, it shall just be a revision of elementary maths that we were taught in school. I played the videos on 1.5x or 2x and solved a few questions to solidify my understanding.

4. Scholaranium: Great set of questions, and an amazing analytical representation of your abilities as you keep solving on the platform. Although I am guilty of solving fewer questions than I was expected to :P, I really liked the Scholaranium 2.0. Amazing work by the team on that.

5. The Guidance and the LMT Program: The newly started LMT program is indeed great. The continual support that I got from the entire team (and specifically from Aditee Biyani) was commendable. Aditee helped me plan the study and helped me get started with the various crucial steps in my preparation. I wasn't a great student per se (sorry Aditee) because I did not follow all the advices diligently, but I always made sure that I was thorough with my understanding of the concepts. Egmat team has always been supportive. Their commitment to candidate-success is inspiring, to say the least. 


Negatives/Improvements:

1. The verbal course gets repetitive at many places and can seem very slow at times. I often wished there were a 'play faster' button so that the video pace could be increased to 1.25 or 1.5x.

2. I feel that the SigmaX mocks did not reflect the actual score range for me. I always scored in the 670-690 range in the mocks (I did not take too many, to be honest). I happened to score 770 on the actual GMAT. This might be a personal thing because I have seen that SigmaX mocks are reasonably accurate for other candidates. But I have just put it here so that some people, who might end up taking the course, remain warned and don't worry too much about the SigmaX mock scores. I'd suggest to use these mocks more for the Strategic Review and to work on the ability improvement. 

3. The questions in the scholaranium are 'like' the official questions, but the official questions, I felt, were slightly different. And no, it is not about easier or harder questions, the official GMAT questions (which you get in OGs or Official GMAT Prep mocks) are just slightly differently. Egmat Scholaranium is an excellent place to build ability but it is more important to give an official mock or two to get a feel of actual GMAT questions. 

All in all, if you are thinking if you should buy the Egmat course, I'd say, go for it! The course shall only add value. I have not tried any other course, but I am satisfied with my experience with Egmat and I think you shall benefit from the course as well. The course is so structured that anyone, from a 550 level to a 700+ level, shall be able to improve his/her ability.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","DISCLAIMER AND VERBIAGE ALERT
1.	A score of 710 may not mandate a debrief especially when there is hardly anything new I can add with respect to preparation tips, test taking strategies, motivational words etc. Notwithstanding, I am writing this debrief  for two reasons primarily. First, to put on record my gratitude and indebtedness to all those who have knowingly or unknowingly helped me in my short GMAT journey. Second, I ve noticed that there are very few debriefs from people on the wrong side of 30/early 40s presumably because very few are crazy enough to go for an MBA that requires GMAT at this stage of their life and career.  But I know that, for reasons of their own,  such daredevils, though few and far in between, do exist. Therefore, being someone from such a  demographic looking to transition from the armed forces into the civil world, my debrief is primarily aimed at those who might be contemplating GMAT while handling high pressure jobs and weighing the pros and cons of doing an MBA and/or making a career switch in the prime of their lives (20s may seem like the prime of one’s life but believe you me it’s not ;)). 

OF NO RELEVANCE TO MAN OR BEAST – STILL ...
2.	My first brush with GMAT was about a year ago when intrigued by the time and effort one of my senior was putting into his GMAT preparation, I took the GMAT prep mock just to see what the big deal was. I bombed quant without even getting to attempt 5-6 ques and got 640 with a V39, which I subsequently realized is not bad for someone who had not even heard about SC, CR and RC till before the test. After that, though I enjoyed the experience, promptly forgot all about GMAT till early this year when I started seriously considering hanging up my uniform.   Someone who had already treaded the path advised me to get a good GMAT score irrespective of whether I use it or since getting one at short notice if required would be impossible. He also told me that based on past track record, a score in the late 600s would be sufficient for my experience and profile. I took the first advice but chose to ignore the second since I have always been a ‘go big or go home’ sort of guy and I naively  assumed that I could easily get at least 730 if I worked on my quant and SC. Only time would prove how wrong I was.

3.	Started by attending  a few free weekend webinars by various prep companies and the ones by e-gmat  really stood out. Liked their free trial and on a whim subscribed for the full course -  one of the best decisions of my GMAT journey. It took me some time to build up a tempo and a fixed routine and my earnest preparations started in early Apr. After that I didn’t take a single cheat day till the exam except for a week’s vacation to recharge my batteries 10 days before the exam. 

E-GMAT – ALL YOU COULD ASK FOR  AND THEN SOME

4.	Egmat was everything I could ask for in a course. It is highly customizable based on one’s performance at each level. The various performance parameters and data points ensure that you neither overestimate nor have any self doubts about your abilities. I used to think I was god's gift to grammar and comprehension but e-gmat showed me that I knew squat about SC. But it also told me that RC and CR were more up my alley may be because  reading between the lines, critical analysis and paraphrasing came very naturally to me due to what I do professionally. I also realized that I had to first unlearn maths and tackle it from a totally new perspective for Quant. I followed a roughly 70(Quant)/30 (V)% time management split with about 80% of the 30% verbal time for SC. It's therefore ironic that CR and to some extent RC, which I considered my trump cards, let me down in the actual exam. More on that later. 
 
5.	I also happened to be lucky that Quant 2.0 was launched round about the time my preparations were peaking and it really helped me shift gears. The detailed explanations and entire format of pedagogy was something I had never seen before and were simply mind blowing. Scholaranium 2.0 was another revelation. Just when you think you are through and almost ready for GMAT, it delivers a sucker punch and literally knocks you out.  Only option is to dust yourself, keep your bruised ego aside and keep learning. The deep dive analysis of each aspect is simply amazing and to be frank mind boggling at first. That’s when I happened to be approached by e-gmat for their last mile program by Dhananjay, DJ. He helped me make sense of the various data points and was the ideal  pace setter, never letting me relax but also never letting me get totally out of breath. His customized plans for taking tests on the scholaranium, analysing the data and time management techniques helped me a lot. Thanks DJ for everything and so sorry that I couldn’t live upto your (and my) expectations.  Special shout out to the resident verbal and quant experts Shradha, Shwetha and Atreya who are amazing amazing teachers from whom I learnt a lot courtesy their webinars. Only wish each webinar covered different questions. 
 
6.	My advice to all present and future e-gmat students would be to trust the process and not try and short circuit or game the system. Payal, Rajat and the other architects of e-gmat curriculum are visionaries and there’s a method to their madness. Average difficulty level of Questions on e-gmat and more so on scholaranium are definitely a notch higher than actual GMAT and sometimes it can be bit demoralizing to not see the expected % accuracy. Also don’t miss the wood for the trees and get too obsessed with the scores on scholaranium or other tests. Remember these are all means to an end that is the final GMAT score. Last but most important advice - keep reaching out to the e-gmat support team. They are a wonderful team. I actually got offered the mentorship opportunity with DJ when I wrote to the team to review my initial scholaranium performance. 

GMAT CLUB – THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING
7.	Where do I even get started about the wonderful GMAT club community? It has truly been a godsend. To the moderators - apologies for being a wallflower and only taking without giving anything back in return. Bunuel, GMAT Ninja, other moderators and regular contributors are doing yeoman service to the GMAT aspirants without expecting much in return. if I were to pick just one thing other than e-gmat that helped me the most in my entire GMAT journey it would the GMAT NINJA lecture series on SC. They were pure gold and I am still in awe of his humility, crystal clear explanations and even his wonderful sense of humor. Other than his surname, which I could never grasp, each and everything he spoke is still imprinted in my mind. 

UNSOLICITED ADVICE 
8.	My advice to GMAT aspirants with professional/personal commitments similar to mine:-

(a)	Make a plan and stick to it. Irrespective of how tired one is try and spend 1-2 hrs daily and 4-5 hrs on weekends.
 
(b)	Try not to exceed 3-4 months prep time coz the above pace may not be sustainable due to other commitments which can only be stalled for so long. Further, laws of diminishing returns might start kicking in.

(c)	 Get your family on board. Like mine, your spouse also may be working with his/her own professional and personal commitments. So, like most things in a married life, it would be impossible to embark on this journey without your partner's support. No more kid’s tennis/soccer classes during weekend, Saturday night family board games, grocery shopping or whatever it is that keeps the family ecosystem in balance.  Make kids, if big enough, a part of the process. My 10 yr old son used to watch GMAT Ninja videos with me and the younger 7 yr old was my water boy, errand runner and biggest cheer leader. 

(d)	Announce your plan to people who matter at work . keep your boss informed. Even more important take your team and subordinates in confidence. They will have to deal with the extra delegation.

(e)	Be innovative and jugadu. I can’t access internet or smart phone at work. So used to do OG ques or take printouts of 3-4 good questions and analyse them threadbare whenever I got time in office. I started using metro instead of driving to utilise the travel time effectively. But that experiment ended before it could take off due to COVID.

(f)	Be ready to press the pause button on your interests/hobbies. Forget your golf, regular runs, gym visits, book readings, Netflix, and similar me time stress busters for at least the last two months of prep.

(g)	By hook or by crook manage atleast 2 weeks off from work just before the exam. If one does not have the luxury of WFH or accessing internet at work this is indispensable.

(h)	Ride the wave, there will be stages within the preparation cycle when your performance will rise and dip. Identify when you are peaking and take the test then. More prep time need not always translate to better score. 

(i)	Internalize and verbalize your envisaged score. Be ambitious but realistic. Best way to keep yourself reminded of the same is to tell it to your kid(s). But if your kids are anything like mine do have an explanation ready if you can’t reach your target ‘coz they sure will want one. The usual shoot for the starts to land on the moon BS won’t work and may come back to bite you. I started with a 730 target, revised it upwards to 750 based on mocks and data inputs from e-gmat/DJ. The fact that the final score was nowhere near it  meant  either that I was deluded or that I just had a bad day.

(j)	Pick one source other than GMAT club to prepare and stick to it but not blindly. There is no one size fits all solution so customise the suggested methods based on your strengths and weaknesses. For instance, common wisdom dictates SC questions in less than 1.30 mins to leave more time for RC . For me I rarely, if ever, took more than 4 minutes for a RC set and never ever felt the need to make notes for RC and CR. The time saved I used for SC.  

(k)	Don’t be obsessed with +700 questions. I fell into the trap and wasted some time in my prep in the middle. Stick to only your test prep and OG questions specially for verbal. Only exception is LSAT questions for CR, which I now wish I had done more of. 
 
(l)	Last 20 days if possible dedicate solely for OG and mocks. Solve OG ques on GMAT club so that one gets and idea of timing, difficulty level and of course the threadbare analysis of each ques. 

TEST EXPERIENCE – IF EVERYTHING SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE , IT PROBABLY IS

9.	 I had initially registered for online GMAT in end Jul which ran into all sorts of trouble due to technical issues and also ended up messing up my laptop settings ( has to be a separate debrief in itself). So I booked the retest at test centre on 18 Aug ( 0800 AM) which was the earliest available date. Went for a week’s road trip with family after that and once back didn’t want to tackle anything new. So just revised my error logs and redid some OG questions. With one week left and nothing much left to do, bought the GMAT prep tests 3-6. Did one test every day and with scores of 750, 770, 770, 730, 760 ( 2 to 6), coupled with the 720 and 750 from e-gmat sigma mocks, I thought I was peaking at the right time. 

10.	Test day ( Pearson, Noida) couldn’t have gone any better. Just 5 mins drive from my home, excellent facility, professional staff just about everything went without a hitch. Since my brain takes some time to start ticking and since mental fatigue has never been an issue AWA, IR, Quant, Verbal sequence works best for me. AWA felt good even though I never attempted AWA even in mocks and it was only the second AWA pssage I had ever written. IR was much tougher than any of the mocks, which was good in a way since it helped me focus better in quant for which I didn’t take the break. Felt really good through out the Quant, managed to keep pace (using the Manhattan yellow pad technique) and though I encountered some lengthy and tricky ques in coord geometry and algebra during the latter stages, didn’t have to skip or guess a single question. I thought I had managed to see most of the traps in DS. All in all this was the most comfortable and confident I ever felt. Up beat, took a small break and started verbal. It also went along the same lines as Quant. RC passages were a breeze as usual and though one can never be 100% sure about SC, I felt confident about most of my choices since I could eliminate four choices on solid grounds  and then select the remaining one (hat tip to GMAT Ninja) . I was not confident about only one CR quant based double negation quest where I was stuck with two choices. 
 
11.	All in all, I was super confident and thought the test had gone as good as, if not better than my GMAT prep mocks. So I was totally shocked when the screen flashed 710 (Q48, V39)) . For a moment I did consider rejecting the score but then better sense prevailed since it really doesn’t matter in the larger scheme of things and based on my profile and experience, this should be enough even if I decide to apply somewhere. But my delusions of grandeur about my GMAT abilities have been shattered to smithereens

 ESR HELP -  LAYING  THE GMAT GHOSTS TO REST  

12.	Once back, I mentally revisited most of the questions I could recall  to visualise what could have gone wrong but I really couldn’t pinpoint anything other than the one CR ques. So hoping to solve mystery  got the ESR though I ve absolutely no intention of taking the test ever again. The ESR ( attached for reference) shows about 5 ques wrong in Quant (mostly DS  with 1,1,1,2 wrong in each quarter I guess) so must be some silly mistakes and/or GMAT DS traps which I failed to notice and I can reconcile with that. But, I also seem to have got about 6 ques wrong in Verbal (1,2,1,2 split) . I have absolutely no clue which the 5/6 ques other than the aforementioned CR are.   If they were SC I could still  have understood  but %ile shows most are CR and one/two RC. Also based on what little I ve seen in other ESRs I thought my splits would translate into a slightly higher score than 710. Though DJ has been kind enough to analyse and make some sense of it I would be grateful if any of the other specialists here can throw some light on my score vis-à-vis  ESR only so that I can get some closure. 

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS NOT SO WELL

13.	To summarise, the short GMAT journey was exhilarating  though the actual destination left a lot to be desired. I did get involved much more deeply than I initially thought I would and even if plain statistics reveal that I wasted my time without much improvement,  ( V 39 baseline and V39 final), I would like to believe that I learnt a lot from the experience and any other day the score could have been different. Anyways in the end GMAT did get the better of me and though DJ has been asking me to retake the test I think its time for me to burn my bridges. Thanks for the ride everyone and may each and every member of this wonderful  GMAT club community encounter fair winds and following seas in all his/her personal and professional future endeavors.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","3","0","","","","","",""

Archit helped me a lot to understand what my week points were and how should i go about improving the same. Archit was always super supportive on both academic and emotional quotient

His verbal diagnosis was on point and really helped me narrow down on what was important for me. The course content was relevant and gave great mental models to solve with. The content was up to date and the type of questions covered were exhaustive. 

Some pointers on the course overall:

SC is very detailed and special at egmat; Concepts were precise and you are just required to apply them on the real gmat questions (nothing more nothing less)
I had previously used other resources and coaching notes but the difference with egmat was that they only focus on what is actually  asked in the exam and not random concepts. This helped reduce a lot of stress for me and kept my game plan simple; High focus on meaning based approach was unique and honestly the most important skill in solving hard questions

RC course is also pretty exhaustive and structured, practise questions are brilliantly designed and actually super engaging; The nuanced paragraph reading techniques are novel but very effective.

CR is also very well designed for everyone, the pre-thinking approach was a game changer for me; The hard level questions on the platform were very close to what i saw in the exam - this was super helpful for my test readiness.

Loved the quant curriculum as well; The hard questions are really stimulating and thought provoking. The solutions provided were detailed and really helpful for my conceptual growth
The 24/7 forum support was beautiful and actually saved me a lot of time; The overall question bank is the closet you can get to real GMAT experience

The sigma mocks were great and scholaranium was an amazing tool to track and monitor progress. I would recommend this course to everyone and special thanks to archit for his support. 

I highly highly recommend egmat and specially Archit for anyone looking to score 700+ on GMAT","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I had given 2 GMAT attempts in Oct'20 and Nov'20 and scored a 700 in each, after which I decided to take a break and restart afresh at a later date. In May’21, I attended a free e-GMAT webinar related to Number properties and found the session really insightful. After going through multiple reviews and debriefs on GMAT Club, I took a counselling session with their team and found their personalized study plan approach best-suited to my requirements. In no time I took a free SigmaX mock (on e-GMAT portal), in which I scored a 680 and enrolled myself for a 3-month course. I got a personalized study plan, based on my performance in the mock and my target score, and started preparing.
E-GMAT’s self-paced course is so well designed that you’ll learn all the concepts that require most of your attention without wasting time watching videos of topics you’re already well-versed with. In verbal section, the CR and SC modules were particularly helpful for me. The CR modules progress in a manner such that they test your detailed understanding of the argument given, recommend skillful ways to pre-think the answer and provide feedback on your selected choice versus the correct answer. Before adopting the e-GMAT approach, I used to go through the answer choices first and then decide the best one, which did not always work out. WIth e-GMAT's approach, I started to pre-think potential answers and it became easier to eliminate the wrong answer choice. thus, the time spent in solving a question significantly reduced. SC modules also help you gain a very clear conceptual understanding of all the topics. In QA, all the modules had a problem based approach in which you get to solve the questions and learn the concepts accordingly. QA in particular was a huge blessing for me in my GMAT journey. In general, all of e-GMAT's modules start with a diagnostic quiz to test your current level of understanding and then guide you through the rest of the modules according to your performance. The GMAT Skills and Application based modules that contained higher difficulty level questions, allow more careful analysis of the question and answer choices to avoid any potential mistakes. Moreover, Scholaranium 2.0 helps you cement your concepts at every difficulty level and has tools for in-depth analysis of your mistakes and weak areas and accordingly decide on the further course of action. The strategic review videos and error log templates are extremely helpful for improvement. I specifically liked the prompt and detailed responses to posted queries (which, honestly, I initially thought wouldn’t be as useful).
Within a few days of starting the course, I was enrolled in their Last Mile Push (LMP), given my decent performance in practice quizzes. As part of the program, I was allotted a dedicated mentor, Mr. Atreya Roy, to help me and guide me on a daily basis. I was given daily study plans, with specified timelines, which gave a structure to my self-study regime. My performance in quizzes was constantly monitored and my study plans revised, as per the need of the hour. My mentor connected with me on a regular basis to ask about how I felt about my progress and about my next steps in learning. The prompt responses to all of my doubts made it no less than private tutoring. My mentor literally went the extra mile by motivating me whenever I scored low and help me plan my studies with adequate breaks. I got advice and key-pointers from other subject experts also until the end day for improvement in my weaker areas and it certainly helped me score well in the exam.
Not to forget, the Sigma X mocks by e-GMAT are very well created. They give you a fairly accurate idea of your potential score and analysis tools, which are very crucial to your performance in future tests.
I gave my third attempt in Jul’21 end when I scored a 690 because I got extremely nervous and panicked during the exam. I was so demotivated, but my mentor encouraged me to try once again as I had consistently performed well in my mocks. For 20 odd days, I prepared myself, not just for the exam, but also to not take stress (Atreya helped me with stress management articles as well). This time I scored a 750 (Q50, V41, IR7 & AWA6) and I was finally satisfied with my performance.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","1","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Every journey is different. After procrastinating for several weeks at the start of 2021, I finally purchased the E-GMAT course. I believe self-study doesn't work in most cases for students aiming for a 720+ score.

A few friends endorsed the product as they had scored fantastic scores after taking the online course. Like many before me, I had my doubts whether an online delivery will be sufficient for my prep. Thankfully, the doubt resolution turnaround time is <24 hours and I was improving my concepts along with the prep.

Allow me to share the key differentiators of the course and I hope this honest review will help readers make the right choice. 

- The SC course is very comprehensive! (takes the longest to complete). It is hard to get OG questions wrong after going through the course

- CR course focuses on pre-thinking - something that works magically on the real test

- Quant 2.0 is a life savior. E-GMAT until recently was known only for their verbal course but the team has revamped the entire quant section. It is fun to learn Quants in the course.

- The dark horse is their question bank - called Scholaranium 2.0. One will not find ambiguous explanations or tricky questions in Schol - something I noticed in practice questions of many test prep companies.   

- I got an unimpressive 610 on my first mock. This is after I had put in 3 months of study. I was naturally devastated. I emailed the support team and got in touch with a mentor.

- Enter DJ from Egmat team: This review cannot be complete without mentioning the support of their chief mentor - Dhananjay (or DJ as how many call him). DJ helped me when I wasn't doing so well. He is a nice guy who will take you seriously! He evaluates the problems at the nuts-and-bolts level and gives out strategies to work on weak areas. We exchanged countless emails and got in a few calls to cross off my  weak areas. So thank you DJ for my GMAT journey.

So anyone out there who is convinced to apply for a B-school should just opt for the E-GMAT course. Just remember, no course can really really help you unless you put in the effort first :)

																			by score report","Points","Location","I tried multiple resources for my first attempt and solved hundreds of questions to get a 700+, but I ended up at 670(Q49,V32). I decided to enroll for e-gmat after reading lot of success stories and answer explanations by e-gmat mentors in gmatclub. I believe this was the best decision for my GMAT prep.

Master comprehension module is the best module I have come across. It is the gateway for GMAT Verbal and a must go through module. This module was an eye-opener for me in understanding and following a comprehension based approach. 

SC course covers all the rules and strategies needed to score 700+ level questions. Focusing on just the grammar rules or 2/3 splits (or any shortcuts), etc. would yield a score of 670-680 but if you want to break the 700 barrier, you need to master the Meaning based approach.

CR course is very well designed and you need to follow the given order to master every concept and solve all the concept and practice files. Breaking down a sentence, taking notes effectively and pre-thinking are the core skills that you need to master to ace CR.

7 RC strategies, when put to practice, yield great accuracy in less time.

Scholaranium is the only platform that I used to solve questions apart from OG. You can customize your tests as per your needs and get a detailed feedback on your performance. This helps to improve the weak areas and reduce the preparation time.

Quant scholaranium has higher difficulty level questions than the official guide ones. This prepares you for the worst case scenario. If you get a Q49 here, you can definitely get a Q49-51 in the actual exam.

Sigma-x mocks are very close to the GMAT exam. Do not waste these mocks and give them appropriately to get the best results( I wasted a couple of mocks :( ). 

My 15 day plan with Dhananjay:
I got a 640 close to my exam after 2 months of preparation in which I reached a 730 long back. I reached out to the support team and Dhananjay helped me exactly figure out the weak areas and suggested a hyper-specific plan. I realized giving lot of mocks hindered my performance. I postponed my exam by 15 days and followed the plan that he suggested and solved entire OG. I could reach a 730 (slightly inflated score since I had given this mock for my first attempt) in the last official mock two days prior to my actual exam and ended up at 710 on the D-day. 

Last but not the least, you always get a quick reply from e-gmat support team throughout your preparation time. So, if you want to break the 700 barrier in a short span of time, go for e-gmat and follow the entire process that e-gmat proposes.

																			by score report","","Location","I started preparing for GMAT from Mid May21' and most of my preparation in the beginning centered around Official Guides. I used to solve a fixed number of questions everyday. This part of my preparation helped  me by familiarizing with the different type of questions that are asked in GMAT. However, solving questions did not help me in creating a framework that I could replicate in solving questions. During this phase I gave a number of mocks and I realized that SC was my weakness and my current method of preparation was not helping me in improving accuracy in SC section. 

It was then that I researched extensively on GMAT CLUB platform and I came across the meaning based approach. I attended the E-GMAT's SC webinar and the meaning based approach appealed to me. This is when I decided to enroll for the E-GMAT verbal course. I made extensive use of the SC modules and they proved to be extremely helpful in improving the way I approached an SC question. 

After going through the SC modules I started implementing the strategies on questions that were available on the Scholaranium platform. There I found detailed solutions to all the questions along with analytics that helped in benchmarking my performance with that of other course takers. Scholaranium helped me immensely as I was able to internalize the framework that I had developed using the modules and was able to work on specific topics.

Also, the constant mentoring that is provided during the course is worth mentioning. I was struggling with the time management in the verbal section and that is when I came in contact with Dhananjay. We got over a call and discussed in detail various issues that I was facing and planned out a strategy to work on those weaknesses. I followed his advice and was able to complete my Verbal Section before time in the actual exam.

Overall, I believe that the e-GMAT team has done a great job in creating a very well structured and easy to follow program and I would strongly recommend it as a one-stop shop for complete GMAT prep.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I scored 740 in my first official GMAT attempt (V44, Q48). While there are many resources and people that helped me achieve my dream score, E-GMAT is definitely one of them. 

I purchased the online 360 course from E-GMAT which included both verbal and quant resources. To start with, E-GMAT verbal is very good. I trusted the process oriented approach that E-GMAT teaches and promotes for all subsections - SC, RC, CR.  The videos are very well structured. Going through each of the SC and CR concept files really helped me build a strong base to tackle the different types of questions. The focus that the SC course lays on meaning based approach really works wonders and becomes the go to weapon while tackling 700+ level questions. And the ""Pre-thinking"" approach for CR is also extremely beneficial. Although, I developed a modified approach (selective pre-thinking) for the CR questions, pre-thinking undoubtedly leads to high levels of accuracy. I can compare the E-GMAT verbal course to a gym - if you are regular and diligent, spend a good amount of time and most important, trust the process oriented approach, results will definitely follow.

The quant videos are not as good as verbal, but they are also good enough. Specially, the new Quant 2.0 course, which is much better than the previous one. It is quite exhaustive and helps you understand and solidify all the concepts. I used the E-GMAT quant course to brush up the concepts and then the GMAT club tests (which come complimentary with the course) to strengthen the topics and increase my speed.

I will surely recommend the E-GMAT course to everyone. Just one caution - if you are not studying full time and at the same time are looking for a course that's fast paced, then E-GMAT is probably not the right option. But if you have time (min 3 months) and are willing to put in the hours, then you should definitely go for E-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Well, a 30 point jump in 3 months might not sound that great to someone. But, for me, it was a huge jump going from a 720 to 750, thanks to e-gmat!
Before getting into the review, bear with me while I give a brief background of my struggles with GMAT. After contemplating giving the GMAT for a good 6 months, I finally decided in January 2020 to give the exam and booked an appointment for May 1, 2020. However, covid hit, starting a series of appointment cancellations due to closure of centers. Finally after months of struggle with the after-effects of contracting covid and motivating myself, I was able to finally book a test on November 23, 2020! While I thought I had done all there was to do to excel, I was unhappy looking at the 720 score. While I was more than happy with the Q51 score, the V35 felt like a slap on the face.
In those 2 minutes I contemplated not accepting the score but then accepted it thinking it was too late to retake it before the second round applications. So, I went ahead with the score and got rejected at all the schools I applied to. (P.S.: I am sure it was not just the score that got me rejections, it was a combination of gaps in my profile and application)
Anyways, fast forward to April-May 2021 when I finally decided to retake the GMAT and registered for e-GMAT, impressed by the structured program with fixed timelines that can help students achieve their target scores. As per the roadmap constructed by them based on my previous and target scores, I was supposed to re-take the GMAT in first week of June 2021. 
Happy with the structure and timed schedule, I started the course, naturally with the SC section and I am very happy to share that I learned a lot of things with that course - idioms I hadn't heard of earlier, new methods that helped me solve SC questions quickly and apt practice quizzes that cemented the concepts well. 
Due to a family emergency, there was a gap in my preparation and I started questioning my whole purpose of giving the GMAT and pursuing an MBA. After a few weeks of self-doubt, I finally opened my e-gmat account and saw the activity chart on my profile - I hadn't done any substantial study for a long time. The bar chart showing the number of hours spent daily and the pie chart in each section showing what percent of the activities are pending gave me the push I needed to get back to it.
Completing the concepts and practice quizzes in the SC section gave me some confidence that was boosted further with the improvement I saw in my SC cementing quizzes. Next were the CR and RC sections. E-GMAT's way of explaining the CR question types and how to deal with each of them is just perfect. Though I took some time to grasp and get used to the pre-thinking approach, I realised its importance once I started doing its cementing quizzes. Pre-thinking makes CR questions look so easy!! Same goes with the RC section. In my first attempt at the GMAT, I was over-confident with the RC section and that is what pulled down my score. But, with e-gmat I learned new things about the RC section such as the kinds of wrong answers that can come up and how important it is to read the RC questions and their answers very minutely to find the correct answer.
By the time I finished the verbal section, I was totally free of my earlier misconception that the course couldn't really help me much.
So, even with a starting score of Q51, I immediately jumped into the quant section and let me tell you, I am glad I paid attention to the quant section. This is because there were some shortcuts, methods and formulae that I was unaware of, before e-GMAT. 
Nonetheless, I did leave out a few sections that I though I knew, because I was short of time and I had booked my appointment for July 19, 2021. While the test center exam got cancelled just 3 days before, I was lucky enough to book the at-home version. But, torrential rains in the two days before the exam resulted in network issues that didn't let me take the test! 
It seemed like the struggle wasn't ending anytime soon. However, soon I realized it was a blessing in disguise. It gave me time to go back to the topics I had left out and get a hold of some of e-GMAT's jewels - the Wavy Line Method of solving inequalities and some other concepts. 
Along with getting a good grasp of all the concepts, I was also able to practice more with the custom quizzes (where you can select specific topics to practice) with the medium and hard level questions of both the sections. I believe that those additional two weeks of practice actually helped me improve my ability and score the 750!
I would like to give a special mention to the Sigma X mocks of e-GMAT! They are a decent representation of the official GMAT and the analysis - Wow!! Having taken as many as 20 full mocks, I know the importance of full mocks and I recommend everybody to take the full mocks to get an idea of the format of the exam and getting used to the 3.5 hour marathon that is the GMAT. However, the official mocks only tell you the right or wrong answer, they don't tell you where and why you went wrong. On the other hand, the Sigma mocks of e-GMAT contain only the verbal and quant sections, but the analysis they give post the test is very essential for the GMAT prep. The software analyses in detail the answers you give and the time you take and helps you determine what topics you need to work harder on. A fun fact - My final GMAT score (including the quant and verbal breakup) is the same as the score I got in the first Sigma X Mock!
All in all, I believe that e-GMAT was a good investment for me and I am sure the 30 point jump will help with my applications as well! So, thank you e-GMAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=68#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took GMAT on 16th August 2021 and scored a 700. eGMAT played a big role in helping me reach this score. I purchased eGMAT course in February 2021.

The best thing about the course is that it is structured, and it focuses a lot on cementing the process of applying concepts. Both quant and verbal courses had their own features:
•	Quant 2.0- Here, one doesn't have to do all concepts. Every module will start with a concept diagnostic quiz whose results will recommend which concept we should do in detail. This accelerates the prep. Besides, multiple application files will help you do GMAT-style questions with the right and effective approach.
•	Verbal- I found its SC course very helpful. Their meaning-based approach is now embedded in my process and has helped me every time in my practice and official exam. For both CR and RC, while I took time in embedding their pre-thinking and reading strategies in my approach to solve questions, I could see the difference in my attempts. These strategies do work.

Scholaranium is eGMAT's differentiator. It not only helped me track my performance and improve areas but also gave detailed explanations of each question attempted. These explanations are way better than the answers explained in OG. 

Sigma X Mocks- I am still not sure about the accuracy of these mocks. Official ones are the best in terms of accuracy. But these will definitely help one in identifying the weak areas- where are you getting questions wrong, where are you taking time, and why are you taking time. Eventually, they will help you in building your test strategy at the final leg of your preparation.

The game-changer in my entire experience with eGMAT program was their Last Mile push program, in which they reach out to dedicated students, assigning a mentor to each of them at the final leg of preparation. My final leg went on for 2-3 months. Atreya Roy was my mentor, and he not only built weekly plans for me but also motivated me throughout my journey. He shared personalized videos during my final prep, which further increased my confidence in specific areas such as Inference for RC. He made my review process easier too. Looking at multiple weak areas, I used to get overwhelmed. But he always calmed me down and built plans around specific topics. Whenever I gave mock, while I could see the improvement, that was very less as compared to the efforts I was putting. Due to this, sometimes, I felt that I was wasting his time as well, but he didn't give up on me. And I am grateful for that.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","0","0","","","","","",""

Coming from an Indian Board, I knew that Verbal will be challenging for me because I did not have much interest in reading books or writing. For the first attempt, I was of the opinion i can shoot up my score in a month with quality resources and hardcore prep. Joined GMATCLUB, the mecca of GMAT and looked through the materials. After studying like a 10th grader, i.e., completing the syllabus and doing questions, I could see how i was playing on instincts only. A month of prep and i registered for the GMAT (Huge mistake) only to find i did guess work in Verbal and ended up with a 640 (Q50,V28). 
Due to Work, I took a three month gap and started preparing again. I had gone through some of the free videos of E-Gmat and during my first attempt so had made up my mind to enrol for the course. I started the course in April some time and Sentence Correction was never this easy. 
I genuinely was not aware of Nouns, Pronouns, Parallelism etc. The Master Comprehension Course was a game changer. I went through their SC course meticulously and had started to see improvement in a month. My plan was to complete a module and try to filter the questions in GmatClub of that module and finish only Official Guide Questions. I was seeing the improvement. Meaning-Based Approach with crystal clear concepts, hands down, are impeccable approaches. My worst section became the Best. If you want to start from scratch in SC, E-GMAT is a no brainer. Just go for it. These institutes have done immense research and have got it into perfection. The amount charged is nowhere near to the knowledge gained. 

In two months time, I registered again for the online Gmat and had a pathetic experience with some technical glitch. Registered again for an offline attempt and got a 710(Q50,V35) with a 91 Percentile in SC. Scholaranium on E-GMAT is a great place to cement your skills. The ability quizzes increases one's stamina. The analysis is on spot with insightful video explanations. Sometimes the background noise used to just reverberate in my ears while doing normal work. It became a habit to approach all the questions in a certain way.

1. Clever Approach to solving SC
I have taken another test prep's company's SC course (won't name them) before taking E-GMAT SC. The primary difference between the two courses is the approach. E-GMAT’s is based on understanding the meaning of a sentence while the other course focussed on “time-saving grammar hacks” to arrive at the answer, in which the meaning of the sentence took lower priority..Now if you are looking for a 650, the “time-saving grammar hack” approach works faster but when you are talking 700+ official GMAt questions, the GMAT is very clever, it will give multiple answer choices that are all grammatically correct, and it's the meaning that differentiates the correct answer from the wrong one. Therefore, I prefer the meaning-based approach because it helps solve tough questions much more quickly and easily.

2. Course contents really good, well taught
I’ve always sucked at tests that needed me to do well at English grammar because of the extremely confusing rules and tons of jargon English grammar has e.g ""Participle Modifiers"" or “Gerunds” or “Adverbial modifiers”. I mean, when I hear the term “Participle Modifiers"", I experience severe mental pain, it causes me to get depressed and makes me want to eat an ice-cream to improve my mood. But hats off to E-GMAT because for the first time in my life I’ve come to like grammar and admire its beauty. E-GMAT teaches SC by avoiding these horrible sounding jargons and follows a very logical approach to explain each concept. And since it is logical, it's easy to remember, absorb and finally apply on the questions. 

E-GMAT Critical Reasoning:
Some facts:
Attempt 1: CR % (based on my ESR) => 28%
Attempt 2: CR % (based on my ESR) => 28%
Attempt 3: CR % (based on my ESR) => 97% (I knew it, i wasn’t dumb!)

After my 2nd Attempt, I sent a desperation email to folks in E-Gmat’s support team telling them I follow their so-called “Pre-thinking approach” but it really isn’t taking me anywhere. They soon replied to understand how I did pre-thinking and then the problem was identified. I was spending about 50 seconds reading the argument, 10-15 seconds pre-thinking and then over 45 seconds on the answer choices. This was WRONG. They asked me to go for a 30-55-35 split, in which I was spending about 55-60 seconds pre-thinking. I immediately tried it and it worked well. I also got creative, tried to visualize the problem in a 3D manner  (think of Iron Man, the 3D models floating in air, him using his hands to move models etc). The results are here, a 97% tile on CR. Thanks DJ & Archit for the guidance. 


E-GMAT RC:
I had received really shitty RC advice from my previous GMAT test prep company. They had asked me to read the 1st line of each para, skip everything in between and then directly read the last line of each para and repeat this for every para. And then I was supposed to magically understand the main idea by combining these statements together and also only refer to the first and last line of each para to get a complete gist of each para. What a mess and what a waste of time, I can’t believe I did this for several months only to get confused and come to hate RC. So what worked for me in RC was E-GMAT’s webinar in which a guy called Rajat gave simple advice: read each and every sentence, not skip a single word. And also, E-GMAT’s  timing strategy helped a lot as well, in which they told how many minutes to spend reading the passage, how many mins to spend per question etc. E-GMAT’s para summary idea is also good and I modified it a bit (See below)

HELPFUL TIP: 
Make all these summaries in your mind and make them fast. Don’t spend 10-15 seconds thinking of a summary, another 5-10 seconds writing it down. Spend about 2-5 seconds thinking of a summary, if you feel a summary is hard to make in 2-5 seconds JUST MOVE ON! 
Also, remember you don’t need to get all 4 out of 4 or 3 out of 3 right. So, sometimes when you don’t understand something in a particular para, try re-reading it if you think its important. If you still can’t understand, JUST MOVE ON because maybe if you are lucky you won’t have a single question on that tough part.


Another good part of EGMAT is the schloranium section in which I could easily take quizzes of varying difficulty and combine questions from different sections. The explanations section in Scholaranium is very helpful and the e-gmat team members reply within like a day.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","1","0","","","","","",""

The best advice that I got from him was to focus on OG towards the end. The Scholaranium makes it easier to track mistakes and review them before the exam day.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I had started my GMAT prep back in Aug, 2020. Took the usual route of going through the OG Bundle, Advanced guide and Manahattan prep books without any guidance.  My study was quite inconsistent until in Feb 2021, I realised that I needed to book a date for GMAT.

So, I took my first GMAT in June, 2021 and ended up with a 720. Although the score was decent, I knew I could do better.  I really want to aim at those top b-schools and did not want my GMAT to hold me back. However, I really needed a direction to proceed in and areas to improve upon.

That is when I came across e-GMAT while browsing for suitable prep courses. I was naturally weaker in Verbal (got a V39 on the 720 attempt) compared to Quant (Q49).

I got in touch with e-GMAT and Karan from the team went through my ESR. He was very helpful in providing insights into where I could improve, examples of previous success stories as well as how e-GMAT could help me achieve my target score of 750+. I immediately signed up for the course as I knew I could reach my target with e-GMAT's guidance.

Hence, I took up the GMAT Online course for a 2 month duration. I am really grateful to e-GMAT for assigning me a mentor - Aditee through its LMP program. She was a constant support and a source of motivation throughout my journey. Her deep insights into my performance really helped me to understand where I was going wrong and her advise of maintaining an error log was truly outstanding.

She started off by analyzing my ESR and we understood that I needed work in Geometry and WP (Quant) and Critical Reasoning (Verbal). Also, a few topics in SC and RC.

It would not be a stretch to say that in my 720 attempt, I did not even know how to approach CR questions. In fact, I did not even know how I ended up with a 84 percentile, considering how I would get confused in each CR question and end up choosing a random choice. Pretty sure, it was by chance.

I started off by taking ability quizzes in the above sections and they truly demonstrated that I was in fact weak in those areas. Aditee, then helped to create a detailed study plan for me, explaining each step to follow. I followed each step diligently.

This brings me to my next point - e-GMAT's GMAT Online course (Quant + Verbal). The structured approach to each section, the level of data insights and nature of the questions are truly phenomenal. 

I started off with CR - was literally mind-blown by the Pre-thinking approach. By the end of the CR module, I could make sense of every CR question. Although it takes some time to master this approach, it is truly rewarding once you get the hang of it. In fact, CR slowly became my strongest areas.
In my 750 attempt, I am pretty sure I nailed CR since I was able to tackle every question using the Pre-thinking approach and the correct answer stood there crystal clear.

I also took this opportunity to go through some of the RC, Master comprehension and SC modules as per Aditee's analysis of my sectional test and mock test scores. 
These other sections were equally at par with CR.
In fact the low RC score in my first attempt was because I used to rush through the passage in order to reach the questions earlier. e-GMAT's RC and Master Comprehension modules taught me how to slow down, understand each word and tie it back to what you have read so far to assimilate the gist of the passage. SC's meaning based approach taught me to how to crack those 700+ level questions where grammar can only help you so much.
The data analytics engine in the course was very insightful and helped to identify my lagging areas quickly.

Quant was equally great. In fact, I would say the medium and hard Quant questions were at the GMAT club test level. I am pretty sure if you do the Quant questions diligently, you can be sure of a Q50+. The way each solution is broken down is commendable and very well written. Each of them take you through the Process Skills approach and nail those concepts in your mind. 
I would also like to thank the quant experts and verbal experts who constantly provide valuable comments to students' queries on the forums and through the video solutions. I learned new tips and tricks by diligently following these posts from the experts. Special shoutout to Harsha and Shraddha for their simplified verbal explanations, which really ingrained the concepts in my mind. 

Coming to Scholaranium 2.0, the question bank therein and the analysis provided is stupendous. It is a question bank pool one can truly rely on to practice on GMAT-like questions. They are really close to the type of questions you can see in the exam. Moreover, the difficulty of each question is also accurately set. The quality of explanations is also fantastic. New questions are constantly added and you can be sure to never runout of quality GMAT-like questions.

Next, the Sigma-X Mocks are one of the most accurate mocks out there which come with their own detailed ESR. The mock I took right before my exam accurately predicated my score as I got a 750 there also. The predicted quant and verbal scores were also similar. Hence, apart from official gmat prep mocks, you could blindly rely on the 5 Sigma-X mocks to see you through your GMAT journey. The level of insights there is also phenomenal and accurately pinpoint the areas you need to work upon.

This post cannot be concluded without thanking the entire e-GMAT team for creating such a fantastic course and a huge shoutout to my mentor Aditee. I cannot thank her enough.

So, what are you waiting for? Go join e-GMAT and see for yourself how that dream score turns into a reality. 
Good luck :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","First, I got interested by eGMAT course because it is not just video lessons, but an interactive study platform with a clear path and strategy. Secondly, when I first logged in, I was surprised by design, user interface, how well-detailed and nice the whole platform looks - I know its  not a key element, but it really helps for something you spend 200+ hours looking at. 
I started doing courses one by one, sometimes skipping, not truly following the recommended path - my bad.  Actually, the course is designed in a ""fool-proof"" way, so as long as you follow the structure, one have no chance but to improve its ability. 
For any topic, you do Diagnostic quiz (thats where you understand you are NOT good at Geometry, for example, after go with basics, all the small quizzes after each concept, after Application quizzes, Process quizzes, and finally GMAT skill quizzes. Such a structure is really amazing way to gradually build confidence and reach the GMAT level hard questions. 
For Quant, some topics looks to easy and there is temptation to skip, but truth is better do each and everyone, and make sure there are no gaps. 
Same for Verbal, the level of details is really impressive, and some lessons, like ""ING modifiers"" I have done 3 or 4 times (that make me feel really dumb) but I was able to understand it very well. 
In the CR, the ""Pre-thinking"" concept is not only explained, but kind of substantiated by many examples and quizzes, so it really drills into your brain. I found it much, much useful. 
What was funny for me, when I did Quant ""Advanced"" module, Combinatorics and Probability, I checked my ability in Scholaranium (it was low), so when I came back to course 2 weeks later, there was already updated files for each topic, much more detailed - I felt bad I  need to do all again, but was great to see that improvements are constant, even product looks good, eGMAT team (I dont know, thousands of experts, coders and designers?) are constantly updating it. 

I did not understand fully at once, but transfer from Study Course to Scholaranium is also very logical and makes a lot of sense. After course done, you do Cementing quizzes, where you solidify all you learned, and after can do specific quizzes. 
When you first open Scholaranium, you think it is just a question bank, so one may want to rush and exploit all the 3000+(?) questions for Q and V, but that is actually the worst thing to do. 
Scholaranium have immense number of questions, yes, but it is best use as a very detailed analytics tool for each topic, sub-topic, question type. Yes, it is greatly designed as well (especially I witnessed changed from Scholaranium to Scholaranium 2.0, and was impressed by amount of refinements made. 
Another great thing about Scholaranium, that every question, (for me especially valuable was SC) has a QA under it, with all the questions asked and experts reply. Actually, I got immense knowledge from this QAs, and only sometimes asked question, and got reply fast. 
Speaking about feedback or customer support. Well, that was the most impressive part. eGMAT have one email for all questions, and any question you ask, they kindly answer within 24 hours, which impressed me the most. And it is not small replies but a step by step to-do lists, which really made me feel that I am guided and not alone in my preparation. 
Most importantly, somehow I was selected for ""Last Mile Program"", which is essentially a free private tutoring, and Dhananjay DJ took time to make call with me to go through my ESRs, went through my Scholaranium statistics (and extracted much more insights from it than I had imagined possible), and created a super-detailed plan what to focus on in my last 2-3 weeks before the GMAT. Such a kind and supportive help was really what touched me, and I thought I was very lucky to be selected for this Tutoring Program. 
With DJ support, I was able to break my 690 plateau: he forced me to make error log for SC (was the best action in my whole GMAT prep.) , recommended to go through some course topics again (while I just wanted to do more, more questions :D ) , and he was able to empower me to be confident in the last couple of days - I am so much greatfull for his heartful support. 
To sum up, all I got from eGMAT is amazing study platform, extremely helpful and kind (and free!) support, and piece of mind that I have all I need in one place; I have the path to follow to reach my target. -> That is why I think eGMAT is a unique value proposition, and I recommend it to all my friends; and to anyone who starts preparing for GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I am sharing this from my personal experience as even after 2 months of preparation with Manhattan books and solving all the OG questions my verbal score only improved from V25 to V29. SC was the area where I was faltering most at. A friend recommended me e-gmat to help me improve my score. After coming across so many reviews I felt confident and decided to invest in e-gmat. It was truly the best investment I had ever made. You do not even need OG books if you enroll for e-gmat. I found their SC course to be the most helpful along with their pre-thinking skills for CR. Their math is also really good if you are aiming for that high score as they help you strengthen your math base with really tricky questions. Particularly, E-gmat helped me alot as just two weeks before my exam I contracted the COVID-19 virus and I was bedridden for 10 days. They helped me develop a personal study plan and I was able to give my exam just two weeks after recovering. Dhananjay was really helpful as he helped me devise a plan for when to take mocks and how to review my key areas. The main thing after learning concepts comes down to strategically reviewing the areas you falter at. Scholararium by e-gmat helps you do that as it is the most advanced analytical tool I have ever come across in the education sector. It provides you with a detailed analysis on each topic and areas you are constantly faltering at. All in all I would highly recommend e-gmat to all those who are stuck with their gmat preparation.

Overall I definitely recommend the e-gmat course. 5/5. Why?

- Value for Money
- Tested strategies
- Helping the mainstream population which is non-native English speakers
- lot of free sessions, which is really great. My favourite ones have been by Harsha for RC, Ameya for Math and generally watching Rajat get so excited about comments during the sessions. Shreya's were pretty great also! 
- one more thing is that they seem to be developing their products
- amazing replies over email and guidance - big shout out to mr Dhananjaya. 
  
Even if you are a math wizz, its totally worth to take their math session and their quant workshop. you definitely learn alot. 

The 2 reasons to take e-gmat are:

1. Verbal sections
2. Amazing feedback and fast responses via email. 

Things i learnt:
RC Reading Strategies
SC Based Approached
CR Pre thinking

Math in general - formulas which we tend to ignore, and how to process things. 

They also have a ton of videos of success stories which are then also transcribed, so it becomes so much easier to to follow and relate to other gmat-takers. 

They also help with personalized videos and hyper plans specifically - this is where Mr Dhananjaya was a huge rockstar, pointing out issues and things i wasn't looking at. If you use their platform well, you'll sure get data to see what things aren't working for you. DJ also had a short call with me to go over my ESR and plan my study.

"August 17, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","My Personal Experience of the EGMAT Prep Course","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I did not research very extensively on which prep course to take for GMAT but rather went ahead with the course that 2 of my friends were preparing from – E-GMAT. I was skeptical about whether or not I should be paying a high amount for the study material mainly because I believed that I needed help with only some of the sections of GMAT. My quant was good to begin with and I was of the opinion that I couldn’t improve some areas of the verbal (RC and CR) much in a short duration of time by using some sort of study material because I thought that these sections mainly hinged on factors that could only be changed by engaging in long term activities and habits such as reading different types of texts. So I was apprehensive about paying the amount just for the SC section’s study material. 
What convinced me was the sigma-x mocks and the EGMAT’s scholaranium since my friends told me that the difficulty level of the questions of the scholaranium is very close to that of the questions you see in the actual exam and the sigma-x mocks had an adaptive grading algorithm that is also very close to that of the actual exam. I also realized that just finding such exams that are similar to the actual paper and give a good reflection of the score that you can achieve was a big deal and hence these sigma-x mocks alone were very valuable. 
The platform also has other useful features. It has a section where you can create your modifiable study plan, good extensive study material, a very good and apt question bank, options for creating quizzes in which you can even customize the difficulty levels, the number, and the topics of the questions that you want to have, a good test series, detailed customizable analysis of your progress, active forums for asking your queries and also a very prompt customer support service. 
Following is a description of how I utilized the platform for various sections :
1)	Verbal (SC) – This was the section I spent the most of my time on. I went through all of their study material, which is very extensive, and I also made some notes so that I do not have to go through the videos again. Then I followed the approach that they had defined for the questions and I performed well in it. I got all the questions correct in SC in my final exam and this most likely has to do with me spending my largest proportion of time on it.

2)	Verbal (CR) – I did not go through the study material of this section extensively but I did see their pre-thinking approached. I went through the quizzes that were spread throughout the study material. I used to get most of the questions wrong at first, but since their questions are very good and have detailed explanations attached with them, I soon got the hang of this section and the pre thinking approach. But I mainly learned it through practicing the questions from their scholaranium and OG. I got just 1 question wrong in this section in the final exam.

3)	Verbal (RC) – I did not go through the study material for this section but again went through the quizzes that were spread throughout the study material. My accuracy slowly improved as I practiced the questions but this was till the end the toughest section for me. I have a slow reading speed and that is mainly what was my weak point. I got 4 questions wrong in this section in the final exam.

4)	Quant – I have good quantitative aptitude and hence did not have to go through their study material. But I did take some quizzes from their scholaranium. I then analyzed my section wise accuracy using their platform, and gave some more quizzes for my weaker sections. I got only one question wrong in my final exam for quant.

5)	IR – I went through all of their quizzes from the study material. The difficulty level of the questions was higher than the actual paper but the question types and the explanations were good.

Apart from this, whenever I did not understand the explanation properly or was not convinced by it (did not happen many times tho), I went through their forums for that particular question and 90% of the time had my doubt already posted by some other student in the past. The experts had also already answered that doubt. This usually helped solve the doubt. In case it did not, I wouldn’t scratch my head too much over it and just move on to the other questions but again, there were not many instances of this. 
Also, whenever I mailed the E-GMAT team regarding any issue or when I was stuck, I got a very prompt reply. Their Last Mile Program also helped me where they assigned a mentor – Atreya Roy to me for making a customized plan for me. Although I did not follow his directions a 100% (because of my other personal commitments and shortage of time), he DEFINITELY gave me a lot of important insights. He nudged me into giving the exam sooner than I had planned and also helped me identify my weak areas and accordingly devise a study strategy for my final week. He was very helpful with the process and also helped me have more self-confidence and take less stress for the final examination. He also offered to help with any type of questions that I was having difficulty with. This made me feel like I had a private tutor/expert with me that I could go to for help if I needed.
In conclusion, although I did not research extensively on other prep courses and also did not use a lot of material and features of the platform (mainly because I did not spend enough time in exploring the features), I can say with confidence that the platform has everything that you would need for your preparation for the final exam and the quality of everything is also top notch.
Finally, if you’re thinking of taking GMAT, I would advise you to do the prep with a positive mindset and not take stress or set unrealistic timelines for yourself. Rather, just try to enjoy the process and give lots of time to any section that you think is not saturated for you yet. I was able to improve my score by a 100 points with just 120 hours of preparation because I took proper rest, enjoyed myself and did not pressurize myself too much with the preparation. The quality of time you spend on studying is more important that the quantity. Don’t just keep on doing questions for the sake of it and try to learn as much as you can from a whatever you can – be it the study material or the explanations and analysis of your attempted questions. All the best!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Since Verbal was my weak spot, I started my prep with the e-GMAT verbal concept files. I spent most of my prep time on the CR and SC modules and these are some of the key highlights from them:
Critical Reasoning: The process of pre-thinking followed by e-gmat is quite helpful and the module’s concept and application files further strengthen our technique to tackle the 700+ GMAT questions.
Sentence Correction: The overall SC module by e-GMAT is quite exhaustive and if done diligently, one won’t need to resort to other resources for concepts. The module combined with the practice from the quizzes and application files really embed the concepts and technique required.
Scholaranium: This was quite useful in my prep journey for both Quant and Verbal- especially the explanations given by the team for questions is very detailed that I feel is better than the OG explanations as well at times. Also, the queries on any question can be posted in the forum and are resolved in a short duration which I really liked. Additionally, the cementing and Custom Quizzes are quite helpful to focus on those weak topics and have an efficient prep throughout.

I believe I truly benefitted from the Last Mile Program during the last 1-2 months or so of my journey. Shweta Koshija, my mentor for the LMP, was able to gauge my weak spots and guided me to push in those last weeks. The personalized videos analyzing my mocks and the next steps strategy plan post the mock were especially helpful for me to have a focused and streamlined preparation in the most efficient way possible. Other than the expert strategy help that I got from Shweta was how motivating and calm she was throughout the process. My first GMAT attempt was on the Online platform but due to some disruptions- I wasn’t able to perform as well and got a 700 score, post which I was extremely disappointed and had lost hope. But Shweta encouraged me to take another attempt-this time at the test center, and also formulated a test readiness plan for me to follow in the next 2 weeks which really helped.
Overall, I believe it was a great experience with e-GMAT and I would totally recommend it as a one-stop shop for GMAT prep.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=69#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","My journey with eGMAT from a 640 to a 730 has been wonderful. There are too many things to write about eGMAT. I will try to sum it up under a few sub-topics.

Content: It is extensive and covers all topics well. It is ideal for anyone who has been away from quant or verbal for some time. You really don’t need to search for concepts anywhere else. The course literally spoon-feeds you. The diagnostic and practice tests at the end of each chapter helps you apply your learning. An extra module on how to read helps a lot especially where to pause while reading and what keywords to look for.

Scholaranium 2.0 and Sigma X Mocks: Scholaranium 2.0 provides a lot of insights. The interface allows you to investigate every aspect individually and address your weak points. The questions are very standard and very similar to GMAT patterns. The solutions are well crafted and helps to strengthen the concepts so that a path can be worked out even if a question does not seem familiar in the exam (I am saying this from my own experience on the test day). Though the question banks may seem a bit too difficult at times, they really improve you thinking and application skills. The SigmaX mocks are exceptional. They are a wonderful mix of medium and difficult level questions. Be it the question bank or the mock, each question comes with an “Ask an expert” option at the end of the solution. This helps a lot, especially when you have used a different approach or have applied a different concept to reach the solution. Simply post the issue/approach/concept and the expert team gets back within 24 hours. It gives that sense of 1-on-1 tutoring to be frank. 

Mentorship Program: I will certainly suggest this to anyone who signs up with eGMAT. Having a mentor really helps. I worked with Archit for 3 months, and it certainly decreased the amount of time I would have otherwise needed to reach my target score. The mentorship program allows you to work under a timed and structured fashion with weekly milestones to be achieved. The program provides customized plans to suit each student and that sets it apart. It keeps you on your toes and if you can stick to it efficiently, it will certainly prove beneficial.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","","","","","",""

The concept videos are exceptionally good, give a very clear foundation regarding the concepts, and the concept quizzes in between the videos are very very helpful. Especially for Sentence Correction, e-GMAT is GOD. Before taking e-GMAT, I used to solve SC questions by intuitive guessing and by thinking which option sounds more suitable. I didn't had a thorough understanding of the grammar and SC rules. But then I took the e-GMAT course, and when I started to watch SC concept videos, I got the recipe to solve GMAT SC questions. First of all, I learned lots of grammar rules. Then I learned the technique and strategy to solve SC questions. And then, I never ever used intuitive guessing to solve SC questions, I just used e-GMAT's strategy and methods to solve, and boom, my score in SC soared.
Even for the RC section, I used to waste lots of time reading the passage and solving the questions and so, in every mock, I used to solve one RC question by just guessing. But after doing e-GMAT's RC course, I spent less time solving RC questions, and so, in the actual GMAT exam, I solved all questions in verbal without guessing anything. Completing all questions is important, just guessing some questions or not being able to complete all questions on time leaves a huge penalty on the score!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

It trains you to understand meaning through meaning quizzes, pre-thinking (not just in CR but all 3 sections) through pre thinking quizzes and finally tying up everything to arrive at final answer. It takes out the instinct factor which is crucial for 40+ scores in verbal. It trains you to treat verbal very objectively and brings an analytical approach.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I had always considered getting a business degree right after my undergraduate studies, but life happens. I found a deep interest in engineering and physics.  I continued my graduate degree in engineering and worked for almost a decade before the idea of going back to B-school surfaced again. With decent work experience under my belt, I start looking for executive MBA programs in the USA. A common thread connecting all good programs was a high GMAT - north of 690 for almost all highly ranked programs. 

I started preparing on my own, gave several Mock Tests, both official and unofficial, and came close to the target score of 700 in mock tests after a month-long self-driven preparation. I took my test in 2019, and it turned out no so sweet. Landing with a 630, my hopes of applying in the 2019 cycle fuzzled out. 
Like for the rest of humanity, 2020-21 was not easy either, but I convinced myself to take another shot, and I enrolled myself in the e-GMAT online coursework and took the test in July'21. This time the score was 700 - decent to support a competitive application.

One might ask why I picked e-GMAT out of so many other branded products? The answer - authentic reviews with great success stories. The authentic reviews increased my confidence in the course, and the success stories motivated me to retake the test and score well. There are brilliant parts to this online program that anyone could leverage despite their schedules and preparation timelines.

Like other non-native speakers, my weakest link was Verbal, and that is where I pressed hard during my preparation. e-GMAT's verbal suite is beyond excellent. It starts with mastering basic concepts and then further builds on that foundation. The accompanying Scholaranium platform gives a very detailed assessment of your learning on any topic.
I benefited a lot in the VA (all three sub-sections) from Scholaranium tests. 

Having a deep quant background, I always believed QA to be my strength but, the little nudges in the trick questions - you can only get exposed to them if you have access to quality test resources and e-GMAT has a rich collection of such problems. And that is how I increased my QA score by two points in my re-test. 

Another brilliant aspect was the detailed feedback that I got on the mock tests helping me to identify the weak links and work on them. The summaries are very graphic and give a good picture of where you stand in terms of your preparation. The forum is very active if you ever have conceptual questions. 

If you are willing to invest in yourself, find a training partner who is not only willing to walk that extra mile with you but also willing to push you towards success. And e-GMAT is that partner.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","The E-GMAT Course came as a blessing in disguise when I was struggling for some direction after a dismal 610. I decided to sign up for the course after multiple recommendations and extensive personal research. If used right, this course might just be your key to a 700+ score. 

Verbal: The verbal course is par excellence, to say the least. The course has been designed in a manner that slowly takes you through the learning process and ensures that you not only get familiarised with the type of questions the exam tests you on but also learn and internalize the skills. As a result, I can say with confidence that I  will carry the skills with me and will, hopefully, build on them. 

Quantitative: Quant has since time immemorial been my Achille's heel. Quant 2.0 was potentially the best thing that could have happened to me for my exam prep. The painstakingly designed details go a long way in ensuring that you get your basics right and steadily move onto the tougher portions. I managed to secure a Q47 (trust me, even this means a lot to me) largely because of this course. 

Finally, the LMP Program adds that extra finish to your prep efforts. After having scored a 690 on my second attempt, I sought the assistance of the strategy team to help me identify my development areas and work on them. I was then put in touch with Dhananjay who used to give me regular feedback after mocks, feedbacks that were very insightful and accurate. Additionally, he would also provide me with feedback about my quiz performances and how I need to utilize the Scholaranium to maximize the impact of my practice sessions. With periodic feedback, tangible goals and constant guidance, I was able to break the 700 barrier. 

To sum it up, if you're struggling with finding the right resource for your preparations, I would strongly suggest that you consider E-GMAT and give it an honest try!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey with the e-GMAT's GMAT online course back in December 2020 after some research on the GMAT club about the different available tutoring options. I am glad to have made the right choice as the e-GMAT provides an extremely well-tailored prep program where smart analytics and experienced strategy experts guide you towards identifying your weak areas, resolving the weaknesses in an appropriate manner, and scheduling your prep in a manner that you can manage it as I did with a full-time job. 

When I started my GMAT journey, I had taken a diagnostic test from the Sigma Mocks available in the e-GMAT course and scored a 630 (Q49V27), hence I was aware that Quant was my strong foot coming from an engineering background therefore I used the E-GMAT course only for the Verbal prep. 
E-GMAT provides a comprehensive and very well-rounded verbal course. The meaning-based approach for SC is the best suited to solve hard questions on the GMAT where you can't just get away by looking at splits. Not only the approach but also the basic concepts are very well covered in the course.  For CR, the concepts were covered really well to develop an understanding of the argument structure in terms of identifying the premise and conclusions and identifying the author's perspective. Here the prethinking of the assumption/strengthener/weakener is a game-changer in getting your accuracy right up there, and, also with sufficient practice, helps you reduce your average time on a CR question considerably. For RC, the strategies on how to approach the RC passages, how to break up the passages and summarizing in between for a comprehensive understanding, and realizing the author's perspective through your summaries from the passage really helps tackle some of the difficult RC passages irrespective of the topics. 

Talking about the sigma mocks from e-GMAT, I found the mocks to be one of the closest to the actual GMAT exam as I got the exact same scores in my final 2 sigma mocks and my actual GMAT on the first attempt. Also, the ESR-like analysis reports available at the end of the mocks really help you improve your approach for the sections with respect to timings, and identify accuracy in the different difficulty level questions for the different sections to shed light on the weaknesses. Also, with the introduction of Scholaranium 2.0, e-GMAT has taken their analytics game to a different level providing brilliant insights and accurate representations of the current ability levels in the different sections of verbal and quant. 

But out of all the features of the e-GMAT course, the one that suited me the most was the constant support provided to me by Dhananjaya from e-GMAT who helped me create an elaborated study plan and fix my issues with my verbal approach, especially with my weaknesses in RCs. His incredible analysis from the sigma mocks, official prep tests as well as the ESR from my first attempt, in the form of personalized videos, helped me identify my timing issues and fix them significantly. Even when I was not able to give the best of my ability at the GMAT and fall short of my target score, Dhananjaya and others from e-GMAT were constant support on my journey forward and helped me get back to intensive preparation. 

My journey has not ended yet with the GMAT, looking forward to what should be my final attempt(hopefully) to crack my target score and I trust the support from e-GMAT to achieve that. 

To summarize, I would say that the e-GMAT course is without a doubt, one of the best overall packages for the GMAT prep, and I highly recommend it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

SC: I found this section to be the best. The meaning based approach and the 3 step strategy to answer the question was just the kind of approach i was looking for.

CR: The emphasis on the pre-thinking approach was the highlight of this section. This approach made me realize the importance of taking a moment to think about the probable answers first and then proceeding with the answer choices.

RC: I found this section to be the most basic yet the most effective. The emphasis on taking a couple of seconds extra to ""Comprehend"" is the forte of this section. I was surprised to see my accuracy shoot up by just applying the strategies covered in this section.

Scholaranium: This is the forte of EGMAT. It is surely one of the most well structured interface to practice and assess the GMAT like questions. Kudos to the EGMAT team for designing this unique platform. It is surely a game changer.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Background

In 2020 I planned to take the GMAT and started the self-preparation using various free material. I scored a subpar 660 (Q49, V30). This score was not going to get me into any decent school for a Full Time MBA. In May 2021, I gathered the strength and decided to prepare for GMAT once again. I had heard from friends that e-gmat was a one stop shop for all my preparations for the GMAT. Right from video lessons to Scholaranium2.0 to sigma-x mocks, e-gmat offered a complete package.

The Study

To make life easier, I was offered a pilot program at e-gmat - “Last Mile Touch”, which is essentially a one on one mentoring program to ace the GMAT. I got in touch with Archit and my journey resumed. Archit assessed my performance in the first sigma-x test and my ESR from 2020 and immediately came up with a 4 week plan for Verbal, the section where I needed most help.

CR was a strong sub-section and Archit without changing my approach much, asked me to just revise and practice questions on Scholaranium2.0. In the RC section, I had a weakness for passages on Humanities. Archit shared various sources where I could find GMAT level passages and asked me to start reading at least 2 passages every day. This helped me comprehend such passages much easily and hence the propensity to get its subsequent questions correct.

SC was a nightmare for me and this is where Archit’s contribution was the most impactful. The 18 day plan to restructure from a random approach to a meaning based approach based on the e-gmat video lessons helped me improve my skill in the SC section. But my timing was still way off and took me 120-150 seconds to solve medium level questions. The next plan was to improve the timing by taking sub-sectional quizzes from Scholaranium2.0 - initially with extended time and slowly and gradually towards the 90 seconds mark, which is the standard for GMAT SC questions. Within a week, I had a decent accuracy and timing at the same time.

Test Readiness

The next step was to improve test readiness and the ability to switch quickly within there 3 sub sections. Archit helped me simulate the exact Verbal section from Scholaranium2.0 and helped me improve my accuracy from 64% to 86% within 2 weeks. Now, I was ready for the mock tests and I took a week off from work. I attempted a mock everyday in these 7 days at the exact time of my exam. I also had a good mix between the sigma-x mocks and the official practice tests. 

On the exam day, I followed the exact same schedule and was super happy to see a 740 score pop up on the screen. 

Last, I’d strongly recommend e-gmat and Archit to anyone trying to improve his/her score. E-gmat has all the resources to fill the conceptual gaps and an exhaustive list of more than 700 medium and hard level questions in the Scholaranium2.0 forum for anyone to practice from. All these questions also have a solid explanation to solve these questions. Archit is an expert and has helped many people achieve their target GMAT scores. He knows the test in and out and will quickly identify areas of improvement, improvising the study accordingly. A massive thank you to e-gmat and Archit.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","To provide some context, I gave my first attempt in Sep-20 and scored a 670 (Q47, V35). Post that I took some time off preparation and resumed studying in Feb-21. I enrolled for the GMAT Online product and felt that the video lessons of both Q & V sections are very thorough. Also, the application / practice quizzes ensure that the concepts and process are cemented.

SC - I've never been great with Verbal, especially the nuances associated with grammar. However, the meaning based approach was a game changer as it helped me find the right solution (or rather eliminate the wrong choices) with reasonable logic. 

CR - Initially I was very apprehensive about the Pre-thinking approach and felt it was not for me. My CR sectional scores were not up to the mark for me to reach my target of V40. With practice, I inculcated the Pre-thinking approach and noticed a sea of change in my accuracy. I would strongly recommend this to anyone struggling with CR

RC - I was fairly comfortable with RC, however, on further analysis (thanks to Scholaranium - it was a breeze to identify weak areas) I noticed that I was faltering on Main Idea questions. I was able to quickly address this by revising the specific topic files and taking a custom quiz (a process that I learnt from the e-GMAT team) 

Quant 2.0 - During the prep for my first attempt, I skipped some topics (P&C, Co-ordinate Geometry etc) as I couldn't grasp the concepts easily. However, the introduction of Quant 2.0 really changed my approach towards Quant section. I went through almost all the concept files and was really impressed the way it is structured. Kudos to the e-GMAT team for their efforts. 

Scholaranium 2.0 is my go to tool for GMAT prep and would recommend this to anyone looking for help to identify weaknesses. This is a brilliant addition to the already solid course offering and helps one track their progress in seconds. The level of data insights is really impressive and also provides the flexibility to create custom quizzes to replicate a sectional mock without wasting a full mock exam.

I really liked the Sigma-X mocks compared to the Gmatprep official mock tests. I felt that the official mocks are slightly easier than the actual exam, especially the quant section. The ESR like explanation provided after the Sigma-X mocks is very helpful as it highlights timing issues, luck factor etc. 

And finally, the support mechanism and the Last mile program - this is where e-GMAT stands out miles apart from anything else in the market. The preparation can be an anxious phase and having someone by your side providing invaluable inputs is next to none. Having worked with a private tutor in the past, I can say that Dhananjay (DJ) does a fabulous job of mentorship. I would like to thank him for addressing all of my countless queries, creating hyper specific study plans, providing detailed feedback after each mock test and lastly the constant support throughout the journey. I still remember, two weeks prior to my exam I had scored a 680 on a mock and was highly disappointed with it. I reached out to DJ asking if I should postpone my exam, but he calmed me down and helped me identify where I went wrong and shared a specific plan of action. I diligently followed his advice and was finally able to break the 700 score-barrier. 

Thanks to the entire e-GMAT team (Rajat, Payal, DJ, Archit, Aditee - sorry if I missed out anyone) who were part of my journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=70#","0","0","","","","","",""

After researching a lot, I subscribed to two online GMAT courses, e-gmat was one of them. My first attempt yielded a score of 690 (Quant 50, Verbal 31). I was not satisfied with my verbal score and decided to give GMAT once again. I accepted the score because I wanted to see my ESR report and get feedback on it. I approached e-gmat team with my ESR report and asked them for help. Within a day, I received a personalized video explaining my ESR report and steps to follow in order to achieve higher verbal score. Dhananjay explained the ESR report in depth and also pointed out my weaknesses. Dhananjay came up with detailed 21 day plan and started assigning tasks to me. There were clear instructions about what needs to be done and how to track my progress. Throughout my preparation, Dhananjay kept on motivating me and gave valuable tips to keep me on track. I thank Dhananjay a lot for his expert support. Kudos to Dhananjay. I improved my verbal score in my third attempt 690 (Quant 50, Verbal 32), not by much, but I am sure that if I had followed the instructions from Dhananjay word by word, I would have had a better score. 

In this journey, I would definitely talk about E-GMAT course, especially about Verbal section. 

Verbal course starts with Master Comprehension (MC). MC explains the very basic thing “reading and comprehension” in a very structured manner and makes it easy for you to follow the rest of the course. Don’t skip this section, this is one of the most fundamental technique you need in GMAT. Sentence correction course stands out as it emphasizes on meaning based approach, which is very important in tackling harder questions. 

Critical reasoning course provided by e-gmat is the most comprehensive material I came across during my studies. It makes it extremely easy to break down the argument into premises and conclusion and helps immensely to understand the line of reasoning used by author. Pre thinking is difficult step to conquer and needs a lot of practice. I think this is where I missed the trick in CR. I would strongly urge that you practice pre-thinking in every CR problem you solve to gain mastery at it. Pre-thinking is the most important step at solving CR questions. 

I did not go through Quant course much and directly started solving the questions (one very god trick I learned was wavy line method :)). 

Scholaranium is the e-gmat platform for practicing GMAT like questions. I must say that the platform is well developed, the question bank is very mature and the questions resemble the real GMAT questions, especially Quant questions. You can make you practice quizzes, concept quizzes and even mini tests. Every question you solve is thoroughly examined by the platform and you get immensely useful statistic out of your practice. The stats report is exhaustive in nature and touches many aspects, such as timing, accuracy, classification based on question type, etc. 

Another astonishing thing in e-gmat is Sigma-X mocks.  I took mocks offered by GMAT Prep and by third parties. While GMAT Prep mocks give a very good idea about actual exam, Sigma-X mocks provide detailed analysis of your performance on the test. These tests are as good as real GMAT and I would advice you to take them in one sitting to get the best analysis of your performance. 

In summary, if you want to excel in GMAT, E-GMAT is the platform to go for. Extremely useful video explanations of theory and solutions along with scholaraniam and Sigma-X mock tests and your disciplined efforts will definitely help you achieve your dream score on GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=71#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

The entire course is structured so well that the need to refer to other sources doesn't arise at all. The course lays great emphasis on conceptual understanding and application, and this is exactly what is required. I saw great improvements in both RC and CR. The e-GMAT reading strategy helped me tremendously in understanding complex passages, and the meaning approach in SC and the pre-thinking strategy in CR made an even greater difference for me. 

I would like to highlight one of the best features of this course - the Scholaranium. This huge question bank was my favourite. The interface allows one to tailor the quizzes as per ones requirements. It is a great tool to help strengthen the application of concepts. Another aspect I loved about the Scholaranium was the detailed solution provided for each question. These solutions helped me further my application skills. 

The course includes 5 sigma X mocks. I found these mocks in line with the level of difficulty of the actual test. The scoring in the mocks is also quite accurate. One might feel that 5 mocks are too less, but honestly, they are more than enough, and using the option to create quizzes, one can definitely create full fledged sections.

Finally, I'm grateful to e-GMAT's Last Mile Program and my mentor Atreya Roy. Atreya really helped me identify my weak areas quickly and ensured that I focus just on them.

I enrolled in the e-GMAT Course in the month of February 2021 and the course is pretty intuitive and flows without any disturbance or lag.

I personally liked the Sentence Correction modules. They were very detailed and helped me throughout the course of my preparation and the meaning-based approach e-GMAT uses in solving the SC problems is fantastic. Critical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension modules can be improved and be more detailed.

I was at a Q49 when I started my preparation so I didn't focus much on the Quant modules but they were pretty good too.

Sigma-X mocks are very accurate and hence provide a real picture of how much you'll score in the actual GMAT exam.

I approached the Strategy team when I was facing a problem with consistently falling scores in the Scholaranium quizzes. The team sent me an invitation for the LMP program and it is indeed the best feature of the course.

Clearly at this point with a 700 I had all the requisite skills but was lacking some fine-tuning and having troubles figuring out exactly what and where I was going wrong. 

I reached out to Egmat support on June 26th with this email:

Hi,

I just wrote the GMAT and got a 700 (Q47, V38) same score as the first time.
I’m struggling to break this barrier.
Is there someone who can provide targeted support, I really want to break the 700 barrier!
Hoping to rewrite the exam again in 2 weeks.

Thank you!


Right away the next day a strategy consultant reached out to me and assured me that getting a higher score is possible. After that I was paired with an instructor (DJ). DJ and I had a 15 min zoom call where in which we went over my ESR. From the get-go it was noticeable that DJ knew what he was doing, he quickly analyzed my ESR and told me that quant and specifically number properties and geometry is where I needed to improve. Within a day he came back to me with a targeted plan. Best thing about DJ was that he was more confident in my abilities than I was. He assured me that I am capable of a higher score and that the current score (700) is not a true reflection of my abilities. 

After our meeting he sent me a personalized study plan spanning over 20 days. The study plan was great as it had specific instructions of what I needed to do to improve my Quant score and my weak areas in Verbal. 

Egmat is a very well built program and platform. The way the course is structured really suited me. They have a 3 step process to everything 1) Learn the basic concept 2) Master the process skills for questions related to that 3) Master GMAT like questions and difficulty. I did 80% of the quant course completely, and all of the sentence correction module. Essentially I did more of the course then was even recommended by DJ as I really liked how the course was structured and felt as if I was learning something new everyday. Their platform scholaranium is one of the best that I've used, it's very easy to do a certain amount of questions and quickly get a detailed solution to those questions, along with analytics to pin-point your weak areas. Their mocks called ""Sigma-X"" were also very representative of the actual GMAT, in-fact they were harder than the real thing. I felt the ""medium"" questions on scholaranium are equivalent to the ""hard"" questions on the actual GMAT. In my 3 weeks of preparation I did no OG questions and still never felt that I was ""under-prepared"". 

In summary, if you're looking for a program where you'll have ample support, while also having the ability to use a platform that prepares you for the GMAT adequately this is a great program. I wouldn't say it's better or worse then competitors as I feel all programs have their strengths. However, the one-on-one support and personalized study plan really stood out for me and hence it suited me. 

Overall after using the platform for 3 weeks and following the study plan, I was able to score a 730 (Q49/V40/AWA 6/IR 8).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=71#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Verbal Section:--> 
SC course is so precisely made that even non-English speakers could able to crack the GMAT with the sole help from the E-GMAT course. Its meaning-based approach had made my GMAT journey easy.
CR course pre-thinking approach is very well drafted. I could save approx 35 secs on each question after following the pre-thinking approach.
RC course is so well crafted including all types of questions such as Science and technology, literature, history, etc.

Quant:--
The Quant section is so well made that I could learn each and every concept from scratch and practice as many questions as given in schoalrium. 

As we know that today's world work on data ideology and I love data. E-GMAT has helped to achieve my dream score by imbibing in my mind that how data could be useful by using Quant 2.0 and Verbal 2.0 as well.

Both were so insightful that they actually helped me a lot to improve on every aspect of my preparation from starting my 400 scores to reach my 770 Score.

What I have done differently after having E-GMAT Score.

Read, Read, Read novels and newspapers(Taken subscription of Wall street journal, NYT, Washington Post).
Read some IEEE conference papers for understanding the big paragraphs.
Diligently followed the error logs. Always give 2 hours a day for my error log review.

																			by score report","","Instructor","Where do I start... Hmm... Let me start with a little background. I am from an Engineering background who has been dealing with math all his school, college life. I also had good English teacher in school which helped me get good grades in 10th and 12th grade. Most of you might have guessed where I am getting to by now. Yeah... I thought I could just brush up my concept and be ready to crack the GMAT. I gave a mock to establish a baseline. Got a 620 (Q46, V29). I studied for 2 months on Verbal and Quant concepts for GMAT and gave a mock again. Got a 650 (Q46, V34). Looking at the score, I was too disappointed. Didn't know how to proceed.

One fine day, I came across the e-GMAT website. Signed up for free consult with Dhruv. He showed me the results of one the students. I was particularly impressed by the analysis and the numbers that they had. I absolutely didn't think that verbal could also be approached through numbers. He then asked me to give a mock and did some analysis. Found out my weak topics and guided me on how to approach them. I right away brought the course and made a personalized plan. Gave myself a target date and started working on it. One thing that stands out is the approach taken while teaching the concepts. Like it is said, a strong foundation leads to a strong building, e-GMAT brought this to life. Each of its concept is based on building the concepts ground up - be it RC or be it Geometry. It doesn't focus on any tips and tricks that one needs to memorize. If one is clear with the basic concepts, handling of 700-level questions becomes much easier.

What I liked most about the course:

> Quant: It starts right from the basics (for ex: it even explains what a triangle is). Every module follows a step by step approach. I found this method especially effective as I used to skim through the question and miss the important details. The question bank is slightly difficult than what you would find on an actual GMAT but it makes sure we are well prepared for anything that the GMAT throws at us.

> Verbal: Here again, it starts from the basics (for ex: Starting from sentence structure for SC). Going through this help get the attention to detail. This comes in handy in verbal since presence or absence of one word can completely change the meaning of the sentence. The meaning based approach in SC, Breaking down the argument and pre-thinking in CR, and individual paragraph summaries in RC were the standout concepts/approaches for me.

I'll elaborate a little more on the analysis, data points that are available for our disposal here. On the scholaranium 2.0, we are able to check topic level accuracy, time taken per question classified at the difficulty level and recency of the attempts. This helps to understand weaker topics, subtopics which need refinement - by going back to the concept/application file and giving custom quizzes just on these topics. Once you get good enough score in these custom quizzes, the confidence level gets back up which is instrumental in an exam such as the GMAT. This is also true to the Sigma - X mocks that e-GMAT offers. I have not seen a block level analysis on any other mock test (which is very close to the ESR that GMAT provides except that Sigma - X mocks have much more depth to the numbers). The analysis tell us the topics that we spent more than average time on and how to improve that. This played a very important role in understanding what went wrong in the mock and how to improve in the next one.

Coming to the support from the e-GMAT team, it is simply outstanding. I will go so far to say that it would have been impossible for me to get 700+ had there not been a support from the e-GMAT team, especially Dhananjay (DJ). He played a role of a mentor in the preparation as well as a motivator. I felt particularly down after scoring low on one of the mocks and was partly demotivated. DJ believed in me and motivated me to do better. He drafted a plan for me, made a video explaining the next steps and was available anytime I needed some support. There was some issue with my passport, which meant I had to delay giving the GMAT, during which time my course access expired. DJ went out of his way to get that extended and help me revise for the exam with a 8-day plan before the exam. I am currently working with DJ for my second attempt to improve the score further(I will edit this review with my second attempt score). This is all possible with the support and mentor-ship from DJ.

In conclusion, I feel that e-GMAT provides a holistic approach to the GMAT exam and would recommend it to anyone planning to give the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=71#","0","0","","","","","",""

E-GMAT is a great product for those who want to start their preparation from scratch or who struggle with timing on verbal section.
After going through few reviews I took the leap and enrolled in E-GMAT course. And this has been probably the best decision I took. The course is structured in a way that it, if followed diligently, improves the fundamentals.

																			by score report","Points","Location","When I started my process for GMAT and MBA, I did not really know all my options about which course to take to study for the GMAT. Being out of college for almost 4 years and having no quant in college meant I needed help for the GMAT.

Upon a friend's recommendation I tried the free e-GMAT access. It was quite detailed and slightly overwhelming but I knew that I needed to deep dive into concepts and then practice to hit my target score of 730+. So I chose e-GMAT.

The on-boarding was very smooth. There is a specific instruction on how to use the course and test your ""test-readiness"". Do not ignore these instructions like I did. It is very useful and tells you exactly how to self-evaluate in each section and sub-section, and gives you important tips on maintaining the error log. 

A singular instance stands out to me where after 3 months of study, I still scored only a 570 in a mock test and I reached out to the support team at e-GMAT, in a state of panic. I got a very detailed e-mail and action points on how to get better and where I am lacking. I followed the instructions to the letter and I immediately went up to 690, and that's when I booked my first GMAT test.

Pros: (i) very responsive support team, (ii) very detailed quant and verbal, (iii) break-down of each concept. The sigma mocks are very good - and will give you a break down of each section where improvement is required. Take these suggestions very seriously and you should see an improvement in your scores.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took EGMAT mainly to improve my SC score. 
I came to EGMAT after doing Manhattan SC books.
EGMAT teaches concepts and also tells how to apply them right away which I found useful to cement my concepts. This also helped me to recall concepts faster when I  encounter a similar question.
Ultimately I prepared notes from both Manhattan and EGMAT to help.
One thing which I regret is I couldn't internalize the whole process outlined by them. My advice for someone taking EGMAT and having time is to give some time to Internalize their approach in SC before jumping to OG questions, as that would help enormously. I couldn't due to my time constraints. USe scholarnium also to improve your shortcomings. 
Egmat's RC and CR section didn't use much. Each person has their strength, they suggested making notes for RC, I am not sure how feasible is that while actively solving, some students might find it useful.
I couldn't as my handwriting is very bad, so I knew even if I make them, won't be useful while referring back. Also, I am a fast reader, so didn't have an issue if I have to read a passage twice. So this is my take on RC, but see what works for you.

Nothing to comment on in the CR section.
For QA, used OG and GMAT Club tests, only advice which has been stressed enough is to maintain Error Log for QA and not repeat your mistakes","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=72#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","My decision to buy E-Gmat course was an impulsive one but happened to be a best one. E-Gmat focusses on mastering concepts and process, an approach that appealed to me especially for Sentence Correction

Why E-GMAT course stands out?

 Verbal course is extremely good. It starts with Master Comprehension which makes life easier in understanding (solving) all the sections of verbal. SC course builds concepts right from the basics and covers each area tested by GMAT comprehensively. The meaning-based approach emphasised by E-GMAT is the best to solve hard questions, which can never be answered by just knowing the grammatical rules

 Although CR does not have many concepts to master, the process of breaking down the argument into premises and conclusion and understanding the author’s reasoning behind the conclusion helps eliminate even the options which would otherwise seem very strong contenders. Pre-thinking the assumption (or strengthener / weakener) would involve some conscious effort, since natural instinct would be to jump right to the options. However, it’s worth putting in that effort because pre-thinking not only improves the accuracy but also reduces the takt time.

 Reading strategies taught right since the start of the verbal course help gain a really good understanding of the RC passages, key to answering the RC questions.

 Quant course gives all the concepts required for the test and trains us on the process which makes solving difficult questions in less than two minutes easier. E-GMAT’s quant question bank is very comprehensive and difficulty level of the questions is higher than that of the ones in the official guide or GMAT prep. Once we get used to solving harder questions, quant in the actual test turns out to be much easier.

The data points (analytics) provided by E-GMAT course are truly commendable. We get a lot of feedback on time and accuracy subsection-wise (in fact, question type-wise; eg: we know how good we are at answering assumption arguments compared to answering boldface ones). This is extremely useful in mocks. I took Sigma-X mocks and mocks offered by GMAT Prep and by third parties. While GMAT Prep mocks give a very good idea about what we can expect from the actual exam, difficulty level, etc, we cannot analyse our performance and how we can improve. Sigma-X mocks (by E-GMAT) are top-notch in this regard. We can have a complete debrief of the mock; I did not find such kind of data in the mocks offered by other third parties (I tried 2-3 sources). So, if you are looking for mocks that are a very good replica of actual GMAT and which can tell you your areas of improvement as well as provide best possible solutions to all the questions, Sigma-X mock is your answer.

Also, the kind of support you get during the entire duration of the course is worth mentioning. A lot of doubts get clarified just by going through the existing threads and you get prompt replies from the support team for all the new queries. Moreover, the team really supports you in the last few days/ weeks leading up to the test. I reached out to the support team after my first mock after course completion. Dhananjay helped me out in analysing my key areas on improvement, suggested the kind of customized tests I need to take to overcome them, even shared video analysing my mock performance. He pointed out that time management was the main thing I need to address; I followed the schedule suggested by him and in my actual GMAT I finished verbal on time and had ample time to spare after my quant section.

While the preparation started on a good note, my score plateaued after one point. I was not able to figure out how to improve my score further. After 3 months of self prep, I approached E-GMAT.

The team was very helpful from the beginning. They walked me through the wonderful platform, and allocated a mentor to me to help me work on specific areas. I worked with Archit over the next 45 days, as part of the Last Mile Push program initiated by E-GMAT. Working with Archit was a blessing in its truest sense!

He helped me identify my weak areas, charted out a plan to help me work on the same, and kept me motivated through the journey through his detailed and specialised video to my queries/questions. Under Archit's mentorship, I worked on my verbal section - he charted out a hyper-focused plan to help me improve in CR, and further strengthen my RC and SC. Archit also ensured that I did not slack off on my Quant practice, and charted out a path for me to continue work on the quant section as well.

I picked up the following skills in the process - Meaning based approach, Pre-Thinking, and RC Reading Strategies! Scholoranium 2.0 and Sigma-X Mocks became my most frequently visited windows (and allies) on the preparation process!

Utterly disappointed with my performance, I was about to give up on my MBA dreams. As I made up my mind to put an end to my GMAT preparation, a friend of mine suggested that I give e-GMAT a try. I was well aware of the e-GMAT platform as I had attended several webinars of e-GMAT. Though initially I was apprehensive about signing up for the course, today I feel that it was the best decision I took at that time.   

The verbal course of e-GMAT is beautifully crafted. The ""meaning based approach"" to solve SC problems was really a game changer for me. Prior to joining e-GMAT, I used to solve SC problems by eliminating the answer choices mechanically, without caring about the intended meaning of the sentence. This technique failed miserably as most of the medium to hard level SC questions play on the meaning aspect. The e-GMAT ""meaning based approach"" worked really well for me and I was able to see a huge improvement in my SC ability. Though this approach used to take some time initially, with regular practice it became a second nature to me and I was able to solve most of the SC questions within a minute and a half.   

In CR, e-GMAT's ""pre-thinking"" approach made life easier for me. As I followed this approach, my ability in CR improved form 44th percentile to 80th percentile. The detailed explanation in each of the CR questions helped me to master the pre-thinking skill.  

RC was a pain point for me. I used to take a significant amount of time to read and understand a passage and still used to make mistakes. e-GMAT's key reading strategies helped me to read and comprehend a passage effectively. The e-GMAT's RC course content instilled the habit of reading a passage in an involved and evolved manner.  

Though e-GMAT is more popularly known for its verbal course, I found that the e-GMAT quant course is as good as the verbal. The Quant 2.0 in my opinion is the best quant course available for GMAT today. In my quant preparation, I used to waste a good amount of time learning and relearning concepts I was already good at. The granular analytics in Quant 2.0 precisely predicted the concepts I was weak at, enabling me to spend most of my preparation time in only those areas. The Process Skills I had mastered through this quant course helped me a lot during the test.   

Scholaranium 2.0 is a major part of the e-GMAT course. Scholaranium is not only a question bank of hundreds of high-quality questions, but also a great place to get granular analysis on one's ability and performance in different sections. From Scholaranium, I was able to get precise information about what are my weak areas, on which topic I should work on, and in what type of questions I am taking longer than the ideal time. This level of detailed analysis helped me to work on my weak areas in both verbal and quant. The course also provides an OG Scholaranium, in which one can practice Official Guide questions. I found this really beneficial, as detailed analysis is provided for each OG question. The 5 Mocks (Sigma-X mocks) I got with this course were fairly representative of my actual GMAT score.    

e-GMAT is not only about its course contents and scholaranium. The e-GMAT support team, especially Nava and Dhananjay (DJ), helped me throughout my preparation by creating personalized study plans. I was fortunate enough to get DJ as my mentor in the LMP program, with whom I worked for the last couple of weeks of my preparation. The hyperspecif study plans and personalized strategy videos he made for me were immensely helpful.    

Above all, during my entire journey with e-GMAT, I felt that I was a part of a large family. The team reached out to me whenever I needed any help with my preparation. Such support is much needed during GMAT preparation, which can be really lonely and frustrating at times.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=72#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT prep at a stage when I was not good at Quant at all and I was pretty comfortable with SC, but wanted to improve RC and CR. I really needed help with the basic concepts of  quant. I went for e-GMAT online course which includes quant, verbal and IR. 
The concept files for quant are very thorough. They explain each topic right from the very basic, this was very helpful as I was able to build a solid foundation. The practice questions after each concept may seem tough in the beginning, but trust me, it really helped me in getting in the habit of solving higher difficulty level questions. So, quant section was a perfect fit for me overall.
Coming on to the Verbal part, the concepts are well structured and the learnings you gather from one section definitely help in doing better at the next section. The pre-thinking exercise in CR was a game changer for me.  However, I do feel that idioms concept file can be improved. I found that there are very few idioms and you will often find yourself facing a question with idioms not covered in the lesson.
Scholaranium is again a very good tool to practice the questions for every section and every difficulty level. The tool points out the specific areas/topics you need to work on and that comes really handy and helps to follow a targeted revision approach.
Now, coming back to my journey. After 2.5 months of prep and decent scores of 710 and 760 in the official mocks, I wrote my exam and scored a 670 (Q49, V33). I was disheartened to see this score on the screen. But that's when e-GMAT's 'Last Mile Program' came into help. I was invited by DJ from the e-GMAT team to have a discussion around my preparation and to chalk out the path for score improvement. I explained to him the specific issues I faced during the exam and he prepared a detailed step by step 15 day study plan for me. This included very useful exercises such as reading news articles to improve RC passage reading time and comprehension. He also recommended to try changing the section order on the exam and it worked for me.
After a rigorous revision and practice, I wrote the GMAT again and scored a 720 (Q48, V41). I was elated to see the score. I felt the e-gmat course combined with their last mile program was exactly what I needed in my GMAT endeavor.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I'll start with my realization of the GMAT. Through my GMAT journey, I realized that being good at Quant in Verbal in general does not necessarily translate into a great GMAT score. What one requires is the correct guidance, tips and tricks to tackle each question type, and the grit and determination to keep going even if things don't go your way.

•	Where was I when I started?
My Quant ability was above average, and I consistently scored 49/51 in any mocks I had given up to that point. My Verbal ability was at 32/51, and I often got confused between few answer choices across all three sections (SC, RC, and CR), and ended up choosing the ‘second-best’ (and hence, incorrect) answer choice. I had solved GMAT Official questions at this point, and although I did see some improvement, it was not consistent, and my score hovered around 670.

•	How I got to know about e-GMAT?
I was recommended e-GMAT by someone who went through the program themself. Its Verbal course, specifically, came highly recommended. Since I wanted to give the complete mocks as part of my preparation and cover possible concept gaps in Quant, I decided to go for the complete course (Quant+Verbal).

•	How I went about it?
I started with Verbal since it was a major hindrance to my score. I finished watching the concept videos on SC and RC completely. I watched 1/4th of the videos in CR. I also covered some topics in Quant which I felt I was weaker on. Then, I decided to give some quizzes and scored fairly on them. I thought I was decently prepared, and so decided to give the GMAT. I scored a 660 (Quant: 48; Verbal: 33) and was naturally disappointed at the score since I was aiming for a 700+.

•	What I did after my 1st GMAT attempt?
I reached out to e-GMAT support asking them to chalk out a study plan to go from a 660 to a 700+ score. They were extremely spontaneous with their replies. I was in correspondence with a couple of their team members, but it was ultimately Dhananjay Lowe (DJ) who worked with me. He prepared a complete plan with the study process which included finishing the concept videos, giving their subsequent quizzes, and giving ability quizzes in Scholaranium to understand my strengths and weaknesses. e-GMAT’s ‘Strategic Review’ for each of their Verbal sections included a detailed process to understand the errors I was making, pinpoint the source of those errors, and make myself consciously aware of those possible errors in future questions. This helped me immensely once I realized where I was going wrong. For example, through the strategic review for CR questions, I realized I was going wrong because I wasn’t able to identify the conclusion correctly, and even if I did, I wasn’t able to choose the answer choice that was related or relevant to that conclusion. e-GMAT’s analysis on each section and question type provided extensive insight into my strengths and weaknesses. Through this, I was able to identify that I was weaker on assumption and inference questions, and hence, took subsequent steps to address those.

Although my Quant was consistent at 49/51, to reach a great score, I needed to score at least a 50/51. In Quant, I gave ability quizzes on Scholaranium to fill in the gaps in my weaker concepts.

I attempted questions from both e-GMAT’s Scholaranium and GMAT Official. A lot of times I felt e-GMAT’s questions were excessively difficult, and I scored nearly at the threshold set for each level of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard level questions). However, when I gave the same difficulty level questions on GMAT Official, I scored far better than e-GMAT’s quizzes. Every time I gave an e-GMAT quiz and scored lower than required, I was left frustrated. However, when I scored decently well in the GMAT Official questions, my confidence grew. 

In the last week before my 2nd GMAT attempt, I gave Official tests every day at the same time my GMAT test was at, and reviewed questions the same day. This made me extremely comfortable and confident heading into my GMAT exam. I scored a 720 (Quant: 50; Verbal 38) in my 2nd attempt.

•	What I did after my 2nd GMAT attempt?
I reached out to DJ for a final study plan that would see me score higher than 720. DJ prepared a plan according to their LMT program which included giving an e-GMAT Sigma X-mock, revision of questions I got incorrect, custom specific quizzes on areas I was weak at, test readiness quizzes in Verbal and Quant, intermediate quizzes, and repeating the cycle. At this point, I knew the type of questions I was getting wrong, where I was going wrong, what I needed to concentrate on, where to spend more time on, and what I could do to make sure I had an airtight analysis for my answer choice. I gave my 3rd and final GMAT and scored a 730 (Quant 50; Verbal 39).

•	What helped?
When I began my GMAT journey, I felt my abilities were above average to score decently well. However, I realized that GMAT was not a test of how well you think you know stuff, but how thorough your concepts are.

When I purchased the e-GMAT’s online content and went through it without any guidance, I had two minds about opting for their service. However, it was the right decision ultimately. e-GMAT helped me throughout my study process and DJ was immensely supportive right from the start, all the way to the end. Learning the concepts through extensive and exhaustive videos, the sheer number of quizzes (both Quant and Verbal, but primarily Verbal in my case), reviewing the incorrect questions and the Strategic Review process, all helped me get from a 660 to a 730. Although Scholaranium questions felt tougher and sometimes long and drawn out, they ultimately helped my improve on GMAT Official questions.

I’m sure if I can get from a 660 to a 730, anyone can. Just make sure you have the right support, which in my case was provided by e-GMAT and DJ.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","","","","","",""
"July 23, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","GMAT 690 to GMAT 740 using e-GMAT","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","I came across e-GMAT through an online seminar hosted on YouTube. Initially, I felt that the course was too expensive and went for a cheaper alternative. I appeared for the exam last year and got a score of only 690. I gave another attempt within 2 weeks and got a score of 710. Using that score, I got selected for the Young Leaders Program of the Indian School of Business. I was elated and decided that it would be the end of my preparation.
However, a part of me forced me to improve my score and try for the best universities outside India. Since it was going to be my last attempt, I decided I wanted to use the best available website for preparation and so I enrolled for the e-GMAT Online Course. Let's now break the review into smaller parts.

1) Course Material:
Since I came from an Indian engineering background, I knew that I would not face a problem with Quant and so I focussed all my energy on Verbal. The Verbal course material was divided into the 3 main sections - RC, CR and SC - and each section had multiple videos and practice files. The course material is truly the best because the videos cover all the concepts in thorough detail and avoid giving generic shortcuts which fail during difficult questions. Learning concepts will help you to face any question. The small practice modules in between the videos were indeed useful and helped in reinforcing the concept. Lastly, the practice files helped in testing the concepts learned in that module.

2) Scholaranium
This is by far the best e-learning product I have seen so far. Firstly, there is a large question bank with more questions being added after finishing a mock test. Secondly, the option of creating custom quizzes and completing them in a time-bound manner is really helpful and I would recommend everyone to attempt all questions in Scholaranium in a time-bound manner to simulate the real GMAT experience. The quality of solutions provided for each question is top-notch and clears even the silliest doubt you can have. Moreover, you can view the time spent on each question and modify your strategy accordingly. I spent a large proportion of my time here strengthening my concepts.

3) Sigma-X mocks
These mock tests replicate the actual test algorithms accurately. I scored 730-740 in the mocks and scored a 740 in my final exam. This shows the accuracy of the algorithms used. Again, the quality of solutions is just too good. Moreover, the analysis provided after each mock test is invaluable.

4) Mentorship
Notwithstanding anything mentioned above, I feel the real increase in my scores is because of my e-GMAT mentor, Atreya Roy. He was really calm and analysed all my weak areas and made plans. Initially, he made weekly plans and analysed the results. A few weeks before the exam, he started making daily plans for me and continuously kept analysing the results to find even specific areas within topics that I should improve. He even shared relevant links for me to read and improve my understanding of the concepts. This level of micro-management has made all the difference. I don't think any other company provides such amazing mentors who have such a strong grip on GMAT.

To conclude, you must only use e-GMAT when you prepare for GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","","Location","Hello All, 

The e-GMAT course is a fun roller coaster ride.. it gave me a chance to learn and at the same time enjoy the whole journey. It is highly interactive and you will not fail to notice the cute animations integrated in the video lessons. It is power packed with information and quick tips and tricks. The detailed approach styles customized for each course helps a lot in deep diving. 
The course also includes a lot of questions midway. These are a true blessing and as Payal says, we should not cut any corners while going through the course. Each question has detailed discussions which we can access while reviewing. 
The best part is that you don't feel alone at any given point of time. The data is always there for you.. guiding you throughout.
Also, the LMT program is great. I was mentored by Atreya who helped me in the last days with a hyper specific plan and I worked accordingly to score a 690.  He also helped me tailor my plan in the last couple of days so that I could best utilize them. It was good to have someone available to help out Wien I got stuck.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","After an unsuccessful GMAT attempt, I became the typical ‘GMAT pessimist’, believing I am not cut out for the test, and questioning my capabilities to get a higher score. After some soul searching, I garnered the strength to read up a bit on the web, understand if I was alone in this battle and other’s experiences. On multiple platforms, I saw many people speaking very highly about DJ. With a demanding job, I was always against the idea of taking coaching / external help, but as I read the powerful stories of previous candidates, I decided to try e-GMAT and scheduled a call with DJ. While I will detail out the reasons below, but to put it out there – HE IS BRILLIANT. HE IS MORE THAN JUST A GMAT GUIDE – A FRIEND, A MENTOR, A LIFE COACH, and at times that support just becomes more important and helps you pull through 😊

 

After my initial consultation call, we both agreed that while my quant was strong (I was consistently scoring Q50 in mocks / actual test), my verbal needed improvement. For me, this was surprising given I am quite eloquent with English and use it as my first language, but DJ has an uncanny skill of telling you exactly what you need to improve (ofcourse, along with telling you how to do it). In my case, he immediately pointed out that my CR was weak, and as I spent more time than required, I lost out on other sections, causing me to rush towards the end. We designed a personalised course for me, and we started within a few days.

 

For CR – I started from the basics. First the concept files, which I think are super useful. Seeing Payal solve the questions, pre-thinking becomes second nature and often you figure out the answer before even reading the choices – this actually helps you save a lot of time– EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED IN CR. Also, I think the modules for CR are extremely well structured as they gradually increase difficulty and build upon concepts, making it easier to understand the process.

 

Next, I took up SC. As I was comfortable with SC, DJ asked me to only go through specific files, which again, I found brilliant. In hindsight, I should have actually gone through all the files because I have heard from multiple sources that the e-GMAT SC course is unbeatable!!

 

Once I finished the concept files, DJ guided me to start taking quizzes. Again, he drew out a methodical plan – starting with cementing quizzes (to build ability) and then gradually moving to custom quizzes (to apply the concepts in GMAT time constraints). After every test, I would send him a report with my attempts, and he would send me detailed video analysis or guide me on how to track progress. I think this is very important, because GMAT prep needs to be tactful – if you aren’t working on your pain points, you will never get better! DJ is super responsive in his e-mails and you don’t really feel like he’s guiding you remotely – I think that’s very important, particularly when you are preparing in a crunched timeframe.

 

After completing the quizzes, we went on to the mocks. Again, DJ would help me analyse each mock and suggest remedial steps. His insights into the psychology of candidates and the test make his suggestions and analysis highly meaningful (if you follow them entirely).

 

While I have spoken about his great tutoring skills, DJ is a great mentor and a friend. For me, that was the game changer…because of covid I had to postpone my test multiple times, and often got frustrated with the experience, but DJ helped me keep calm and guided me on how to navigate this situation. I feel it’s really helpful to have someone give you moral support during the stressful prep - it makes the journey enjoyable and keeps your spirits high; for me, that was DJ! 😊","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Background: I am a married 32-year-old individual working in India’s biggest manufacturing enterprise in the energy sector for 10+ years. I was completely out of touch with exam preparation. I started with a score of 560( Q46 & V21) in the eGMAT SigmaX mock. I would recommend that you try eGMAT for its data-driven analysis.
Preparation:
1.    Quant: I started with a score of 46 and always scored above 49 in all the mocks after going through the basics. (except some GMAT club practice tests). Please take my advice in this context. 
·         Resources: Inline with commandments of Slingfox (https://gmatclub.com/forum/gmatclubbing-administered-770-50q-45v-86239.html) build a very solid foundation in GMAT centric maths. Even if you have a very solid background in Maths, it is worthwhile to refer to Manhattan GMAT Maths books and refresh your basics. These guides are enough to reach a score of 48/49. For more advanced concepts, refer to GMAT MATH BOOK in downloadable PDF format by Bunuel and be grateful. I would refer Manhattan Advanced GMAT Quant for cementing the score of 50/51.
 
·         Practice: I solved all the OG questions using the GMAT club error log (very important to use a timer). If you are looking for Q50/51 score, solve the most difficult questions of any source on GMAT club with error log & timer.
 
·         Practice Test: Build your Math Muscles with GMATClub Tests. DO NOT TRY THIS BEFORE FINISHING THE BASICS. These are one of the hardest questions available on quant. Initially try to solve without a timer and don’t get disheartened if you cannot solve questions even in 10-15 minutes. I found most of the questions much harder than Official prep questions. 
 
·         Actual Exam: I found actual GMAT Online quant questions were much lengthier and harder than official questions. It served me very well that I had attempted almost 20 GMAT club quant tests.
 
2.    Verbal: I started with an ability of 16% in Sentence Correction, 16% in RC, and 63% in CR as per eGMAT Sigma X mock. Harshit recommended me the e-GMAT course for verbal and I cannot thank him enough. 
 
·         Course: eGMAT Online Verbal course is very structured and comprehensive. I religiously followed the order in which I needed to study the individual sections. I believe that it is the best course for SC. I devoted 2 months totally to the Sentence Correction module. The animated modules of eGMAT improve upon the efficiency of a student and for this reason, the retention ability remains on a higher side. The success of Sentence Correction is your ability to understand the meaning, logic and learn core skills. The 3-step approach to SC is extremely helpful.  eGMAT sentence correction course takes the journey from basic concepts to advanced skills very smoothly. 
 
In CR, Structure and pre-thinking steps gives a solid understanding of the argument. In RC, the solution technique for Inference questions was best. In my opinion and as in my case, you will have to practice a lot (I limited my practice to official questions of GMAT only on GMAT club). You can also attempt LSAT questions. 
 
The team at e-GMAT is extremely helpful. Payal always promptly responded and helped me. The eGMAT team is very friendly and really invests in your preparation.
 
I owe an increase of 15 points in my verbal score (from my mock score to actual score) solely to e-GMAT. The process and structure of the course really helped me improve my skills. The way the concepts are taught, I am sure I will carry this knowledge throughout my MBA as well.
 
·         Practice: Practice on Scholaranium. The quality of the explanations is very high. The level of data insights on your accuracy & ability is pure gold.
 
3.    AWA: Like me if are not good at writing and you are happy with a score of 5 or 5.5, just go to this page 1 or 2 days before the actual exam and write one AWA answer based on these templates (https://gmatclub.com/forum/how-to-get-6-0-awa-my-guide-64327.html).
 
4.    My Story: I started my preparation in Sep’20. After 3 months of preparation was ready to book the exam in Dec’20/Jan’21, but fate had some other plans for me. I got Covid-19 in December and it took me one and half months to recover and regain my strength.
 
I started preparing for GMAT again from the last week of Jan’21. In Feb and March, my work schedule went crazy. I could hardly study for 1 hour or less during this time. With a proper study of 4-5 hours in April & May, I booked the GMAT exam on 17th June at Hyderabad Test Centre. One week before the scheduled exam, my scheduled test was canceled by Test Centre without providing any reason (I assumed that it must be owing to Covid-19).
 
I immediately scheduled the test again on 23rd June and it was canceled again by the Test Centre.
 
I really wanted to finish off the exam when I was scoring high in official GMAT prep. I was exploring the option of the GMAT Online Exam. I read a lot about the online experience on GMAT club and it helped. 
 
GMAT Online Exam Requirement: 
Physical Whiteboard: I ordered one physical whiteboard from amazon but the quality was average and I received a damaged product  You must order very good quality fine-tip marker. 
 
Duster: I struggled a lot for getting a good quality duster and could not get a good quality duster. I ordered and checked these dusters. They were useless. I tried other dusters too from a local shop. I stuck a bundle of cotton cloth on three dusters and used them. In quant, I am a step by step solver kind of person, so I write a lot, it was not supposed to be an issue at the test center, but it became an issue in GMAT online exam. As I had limited space of whiteboard to write and I had to erase many times during Quant section, non-availability of good quality duster did cost me at least 2-3 minutes in the quant and 1-2 minutes in verbal section.
 
Backup wifi connection: Arrange for a good wifi connection as the primary connection. I would suggest that you arrange for a backup connection too. I arranged one backup jiofi device (4G Hotspot device in India). It is better to be prepared with backup wifi or a Hotspot device. I did not need a backup connection during the actual exam. I showed the backup device to the instructor online and he had no issues with it.
 
GMAT Online Experience: The experience was good but not great. The exam started smoothly. I went for both scheduled breaks after Quant and Verbal.
·         Difficulty Level: I felt that Quant was super difficult compared to GMAT official prep questions. However, the GMAT Online exam was forgiving and I scored 50.
Verbal was also very difficult for me. I had improved my RC accuracy to 90% and solved most of the 700+ RC official passages on the GMAT club, but I was stumped by the difficulty level of RC. I got short but very convoluted RC passages and questions were very difficult too. It was very difficult to eliminate even 2/3 answer choices. CR & SC were difficult too. 
 
·      System Hanging Issue: This was one teething problem throughout the exam - the system was hanging for a few seconds whenever I clicked the answer or submitted the answer. I was using a Lenovo legion 8 GB Intel i-5 laptop with Windows 10. I lost approximately 2-3 minutes on each section due to this issue. It was very frustrating.
 
During AWA also, the system was hanging and I lost more than 2-3 minutes. It did not matter that I lost time in AWA but it was frustrating to wait for few seconds for the text to appear on screen after typing.
 
Overall, the experience of GMAT Online was average. Finally, I completed the exam and a score of 720 appeared. I breathed a sigh of relief!! I was expecting a lower score!!
 
Final Advice:
1.  	Value your time and choose the right material/course for yourself: There is a lot of material available for GMAT preparation and research very well before you commit your time. The eGMAT team is very friendly and really invests in your preparation.
Aim high. Track & monitor your performance (Use two types of error logs)
One type of error log to track your ability, accuracy & timing. I used the gmatclub error log 
The second type of error log is a simple excel sheet to keep the list of mistakes and learning. This type of error log comes very handy in identifying blind spots and mistake patterns. I cannot recommend this enough.
Persevere – Be ready to hit few bumps along the way. But persevere and Do not lose hope. Book the exam only when you are ready and have already scored at least 20-30 points higher than your target score in the official GMAT prep mock.

																			by score report","","Location","The toughest decision GMAT aspirants face at the start of their preparation is which course to put their trust in. I too lingered over this decision for a fair amount of time and after a lot of research I decided to go for E-Gmat. I attended many of the free GMAT strategy and verbal seminars conducted by E-Gmat and was really impressed by its structured approach to solving the questions compared to other courses which focus mainly on getting to the answer and not on how to actually get there.
What worked for me?
The verbal course is absolutely fantastic. It leaves no stones unturned when it comes to covering concepts essential for GMAT verbal. It starts with Master Comprehension which tells you how to approach all the verbal subsections in general and lays a solid foundation for things to come. The SC course is a life saver and covers everything related to SC comprehensively. Just knowing grammar isn’t enough to excel on GMAT and that’s where the meaning-based approach emphasized by E-Gmat comes into play and is the best way to solve hard SC questions.

CR is just all about application and hence the method to approach the problem Is of utmost importance. E-Gmat helped me in solidifying that method by introducing me to processes such as Pre-Thinking and negating the statement to find what breaks the conclusion. I was often stuck between two answers until I got the hang of pre-thinking.

RC is more about paying attention, getting immersed into the passage and being patient than anything else. The E-Gmat reading and note-taking strategies help a lot in these regards.

Coming from an engineering background, I didn’t need help as much with learning concepts as with streamlining my process skills. The E-Gmat quant has accurate diagnostic quizzes right at the start of each topic which helped me identify my skill level in that topic and hence enabled me to pay more attention to my weak areas. I was really struggling with DS questions before as I used to jump to conclusions and ignore important information but with the quant course, I was able to identify and work on the gaps causing such issues.

The scholaranium is an amazing platform which not only acts as a question bank but also as a private tutor. The data provided by it is really commendable as it helps to pinpoint the actual gaps in your knowledge and also keeps track of your performance in various sub sections. I can safely say that sigma-X mocks are the best mocks out there as the data insights and performance analysis it provides is unmatched. You can not only pinpoint which section you are weak in but also the particular sub-section where you are facing difficulties. So, if you are looking for mocks that are a very good replica of actual GMAT and which can tell you your areas of improvement as well as provide best possible solutions to all the questions, Sigma-X mock is your answer.

The course is tremendous but what impressed me the most was the kind of support which E-Gmat provides. I was lucky enough to be contacted by Dhananjay, my mentor during the LMP program. I got in contact with him after I finished the course and he has helped me at every step since then whether it be providing me with hyper-specific plans, highlighting my weak areas or motivating me. After my second attempt which was disappointing to say the least, he got in touch with me on his own accord and let me know that he backs me 100% and believes that I can achieve my target , such trust shown by him in his students is really commendable. His continuous support, even now, has been a major boost for my ongoing preparations.
To sum it all up, looking for a course which takes care of everything for you and lets you focus entirely on studying? Look no further than E-Gmat!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=73#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Background: 

I am a non-native speaker from India with an Engineering background. I was always confident about my Quant ability but was sceptical about Verbal ability.  After taking an Initial Mock, my hunch was confirmed in which I scored a 640 ( Q48 and V26). Even though I scored less in verbal in my Initial mock, the thing which boosted my confidence that I can score well in Verbal was that Verbal in GMAT is more logical play than a theoretical play. Having given GRE before, the one thing I didn't like in GRE prep was the requirement to remember a lot of information which can lead to exhaustion very easily. 

Course Shortlist: 

Knowing I had to mostly concentrate on my Verbal ability, I was searching for the best Verbal course for non-native speakers ( I was looking from utter basics to advanced level). I came across the E-GMAT course while I was researching for courses. I took the trial to see the user experience of the course to decide if it is fit for my likings and I immediately liked and enrolled on the course. 

Preparation: 

I started with my Verbal prep carefully going through all the videos, tests and practise questions in the course. After done with Verbal course completion I skimmed through the Quant course to brush up on my Quant knowledge. After I was done with all the concepts, I started with scholarium for practising the concepts.  Initially, the score was low in all three sections in Verbal, but with scholarium analytics, I slowly improved on my weak areas. 

Mentorship:

E-GMAT mentorship played a crucial point in my journey by giving structure to my preparation. Archit has been super helpful in devising an improvement in each of the three sections in Verbal. I would strongly advise getting mentorship as it will be helpful to have a mentor to guide you in the right direction based on their experience. 

Result: Scored 730 on The Day with V38 and Q50. Scored 95% in CR, 90% in SC and 28% in RC. My average RC percentile has been around V40 but scored only V22 on exam day. Clearly, there is scope for improvement in RC, so will be giving the exam again. 

Things that helped immensely: 

Pre thinking approach for CR was a game-changer. I improved my accuracy from the mid-'60s to above 90's with the approach. I scored above 90% in all the mocks and also in the final exam with the help of the approach. 

Sentence Correction takes time and there is nothing to worry about your ability. Your ability will increase with practice and you will notice an increase in accuracy and speed with more practice. Attention to detail in sentences is very important to spot errors. I cannot stress this point more as we usually tend to skim through the sentence. The meaning-based approach also helps in improving speed and accuracy. 

Jotting down points and summarising each paragraph helps to remember more information from paragraphs. A comprehensive reading course by E-GMAT helped me realize the need for easily understanding each statement.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=74#","0","0","","","","","",""

But, I was proved wrong! The course is curated in a very structured manner. The personalized study plan actually works! It helped me pace myself efficiently. Best part of e-gmat course was the SC component. It helped me secure a 98th percentile on the particular section. The meaning based approach yielded dividends on the exam. CR and RC materials are on point as well. The Scholaranium made a huge difference. Cementing, Custom and Ability quizzes really prepped me up for the exam. Overall, the course was amazing.

I was approached by the e-gmat team for the Last Mile Program and Atreya Roy ( big kudos to him) turned out to be my mentor. The best parts of the LMP are the guidance and review sessions. Atreya spent a good chunk of time curating the right personalized strategies for me to implement. He was always reachable (even for the silliest of the doubts). The plan was easy to grasp and follow. The constant monitoring and the push from the mentor's end definitely helped me ease through the last mile of my preparation. Big thanks to Atreya and his team for guiding me through my prep journey.

I attended a few of those and realised that their strategy and tips were fundamentally better than my previous coaching and so decided to go ahead with the E-GMAT course. It turned out to be really helpful, with all its specifically categorized modules, quizzes and concept skills. I was able to recognise my weak areas through the multiple sets of quizzes and their detailed analysis, and work on them specifically. The course is amazingly insightful when it comes to analysing your mistakes and reviewing them.  

The verbal modules -  SC, CR, RC, have very detailed concept files which gives you a clear understanding of each. For me the major strategy that helped was Prethinking. The concept and its constant practice made me improve my verbal score evidently. Additionally, the modules on how to go about the different sets of RC questions helped me follow different strategies for each and answer the questions with a logical approach. 

The Quant section helped me with the detailed analysis of my weak areas so that I could just improve the specific concept gaps and keep practicing the overall quizzes consistently. The huge number and the large variety of questions kept me on my toes throughout. 

My mentor, Atreya, had been really helpful as he devised such specific study plans for my prep. He was consistent with me and extremely supportive throughout. He helped me analyse the various aspects of my performance, which I was unable to focus on initially. The last mile in my prep, the Sigma mocks, were incredible in terms of their level of questions, their appropriateness and of course, the detailed analysis available to review my attempt. 

To sum up, I am extremely satisfied with my decision of choosing E-GMAT for my preparation and highly recommend it to anyone starting their preparation as well!

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I started preparing for my GMAT in early July 2020 and gave my first attempt at October 13th 2020. I had prepared well, I was scoring 710-720 in official mocks and I was hoping to convert the same in my real test, but I got shocked when I ended up with a 660. Now, I have always had a fear of tests, I tend to do well in prep, mocks and solve questions with high accuracy during my practice in a limited time frame, but the D-day is where it all goes wrong. So I decided, I will go with a nothing to lose attitude and attempt gmat once more in a month. In my second attempt, I ended up with a 670. One month and 10 point improvement was not what I was expecting. I thought since I have a good momentum going, I will focus on gmat for one more month completely and try to just beat my current score, whatever it maybe. I subscribed to the egmat course and I ended up with a 680 (Q50, V32). I wasn't completely satisfied but I took it in my stride and started thinking of applications.

I decided to give one last attempt in July 2021 before I start my applications, and that's when I resumed my egmat subscription in May and asked for help from a mentor to guide me through the prep and correct me in case I go wrong. And since the first day itself, Atreya was as involved in my prep as I was. I was given a complete day to day plan with instructions on how to review the errors I was making. Since I had lost touch in the last 5 months, it was not easy to pick up right where I left off. But within 1 month, my mock scores went from 690s to 740s. My verbal improved from V34 to V42  in my mocks and my Quant stayed consistent at Q49. I was given a constant push from Atreya to hit Q50 in every mock I give. And that is when the error log and going through the explanations helped me a lot. Through the data analytics after my each test, I was able to understand that I was making a lot of errors in the Number systems and word problem sections and I went back to the drawing board to do concept cementing quizzes to better my quant performance. And it worked within a week of consistent effort.  For verbal, what helped my performance was patience to go back and do the questions using the correct approach. Trust me, meaning based approach to solve SC questions is a miracle. It surpasses the need to find flaws in a sentence and saves a ton of time and effort. Similarly reading skills are really important for CR and RC. Having a proper approach really helps in answering these questions.

I was still super afraid of the tests as a lot of it was banking on the score, but one thing that sigma mocks helped me do is to gauge my performance in a gmat and gain some confidence. The mocks are really close to the gmat exam, especially the verbal section, which will test your test taking temprament very well.

In the final 2 weeks, all my weak focus areas were pointed and Atreya was able to get me help from all the subject matter experts in a very short time frame. He very dilligently helped me everyday with my doubts and questions and kept the motivation up till th every last day of my exam. It helped me a lot to get over my nerves and do better.

I would recommend e-GMAT to anyone who is planning to start their prep. It is always helpful to have a constant guiding light when one is confused about so many things.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=74#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took the e-GMAT course in June 2021 after I had taken an attempt in early June. I had prepared a fair bit and did well on the mocks however the main exam made me realise some fundamental gaps. 

I lacked a process to solve the questions and also lacked section specific guidance to improve on my ability. e-gmat and Dhananjay came in and helped me improve my ability a fair bit. I improved from a 38 to a 40 in verbal within 10 days of starting work with egmat. 

What I love about e-gmat: 
Fantastic portal that gives you excellent insight. You do not waste time analysing, you only learn, cement and perform

The exercises are built methodically after completing each section I could see an improvement in my ability. 

The personalized support that the team offers. They peer through your performance and give you sectionwise analysis on what to focus on. DJ offered me his personal number. I continuously kept in touch and troubled him for doubts. This is super helpful for a scattered person like me. 

The sigma X mocks are fantastic

The methodologies that e-gmat have pioneered - pre-thinking, meaning based SC and critical reading skills. (I was able to get 98th and 91st percentile in SC and CR respectively)

I think e-gmat is the best solution out there for retakers. I am now working with the team to get a better score than what i have landed. I am sure I should be able to achieve it with their help and guidance. I keep wishing I had started the prep with e-gmat many months ago! 

Above all, e-gmat does not judge or make you feel uncomfortable. They are matter of fact and mission driven towards helping us achieve our goal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=74#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","When I started off with my GMAT preparation, I was under the impression that I would not need a structured program to get 700+. Afterall, how difficult could high school math and elementary verbal reasoning be? Right? WRONG! 

GMAT, across both quant and verbal sections is a test of one's logical thinking prowess and mental stamina. A structured preparation is a must and I realized this the hard way in my initial endeavor. 

It was then that I reached out to eGMAT and was told about the LMP (last mile push) program which is aimed at providing the right course content along with highly personalized 1-to-1 coaching. I was glad to get assigned DJ (Dhananjay) my mentor who promptly put me on a study plan comprised of the right combination of video lessons and practice on Scholaranium. 

Since I had already got a head start in my preparation before subscribing to eGMAT, DJ advised me to go through specific lessons in Verbal while focusing on practicing questions under time pressure. However, I was so enamored by eGMAT's brilliantly crafted verbal section that I ended up completing the entire course - every single video lesson and practice question.  

eGMAT's structured approach to cracking CR is extremely helpful in hitting a high accuracy in difficult 700+ level questions. And their SC methodologies are almost guaranteed to enable 90%+ accuracy on even the most convoluted and tricky questions. One just needs to trust in the process and remain patient while the course builds up the ability to take on even the most difficult questions head on. 

Since I was focusing mainly on improving my verbal performance, I did not go through the entire quant course. However, the sections that I did go through were very comprehensive while retaining the trademark eGMAT structured approach. Their frameworks are gold standard across topics - the meaning based approach in SC and the pre-thinking mandate in CR being a couple of top-of-mind examples. 

Scholaranium 2.0 is a massive upgrade and an extremely useful tool and throws trenchant insights into one's strengths and weaknesses. In terms of making one cognizant about areas of improvement, it is just about as subtle as a sledgehammer! With the level of granularity of inputs it provides on sectional ability and the pointers for improvement it assists with, it is the best ""digital coach"" that I have come across to build test readiness. 

And talking about coaches, I cannot thank DJ enough for all the support and multitudinous insightful recommendations he shared with me throughout my preparation. He was very prompt in responding to my queries and gave sharp weekly action plans for me to execute. With a fortnight to go for my test, he helped me with a hyper-specific, completely personalized plan basis the insights that Scholaranium 2.0 had thrown. This helped me focus on areas of improvement at a time sticking to a sagaciously chosen study schedule mattered the most.  

In my first attempt, I got 720 (Q48, V41). I could have done better in quant and will go for a retest. In verbal, I was consistently in the 35-38 zone in prior mocks and the 40+ score in the actual test was thanks to the rigor I was exposed to in the well rounded eGMAT course and ofcourse to DJ's inputs. 

All in all, try as I may but I find it hard to critique eGMAT's offerings. It is a rock solid, profoundly well-thought through, robustly crafted, comprehensive course for GMAT preparation and test readiness. In my opinion, easily the best course out there. I would highly recommend it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=74#","0","0","","","","","",""

The e-gmat courses on verbal are best suited for people looking for a considerable improvement in their ability in SC, CR and RC. My personal favorite is the SC course with detailed applications for each of the concepts to cement the learning. The approaches provided are really handy and I would recommend this for aspirants with weak SC.

CR and RC for me were majorly about slight improvements here and there and I felt the course structure is straight forward to build your skillset specific to GMAT. 

Scholaranium acts as the guiding tool for measuring your ability. 
Important tips :
1. Do not jump into scholaranium practice before finishing at least Level 1 of any course. I made that mistake and ended up losing a lot of precious time. 
2. Attend the onboarding session which is conducted regularly. This will help structure your preparation. I attended the session by Nava later in the preparation and it helped not lose valuable time. 
3. Do go through the comments/questions in each of the lessons, you will end up clarifying most of your doubts.
4. Work with the mentors and create a personalized plan tailor made to your needs. This is really important and can save significant time in your preparation.

GMAT Attempt 1 - 5th November 2020 - Q49, V36 - 700
GMAT Attempt 2 - 30th June 2021 - Q48, V40 - 710
GMAT Attempt 3 - To be given in July 2021 - I'll update my score in this review at the end of this month.

Preparation:

I am an engineer by education and work in the Venture capital industry for the past 4 years. Owing to my engineering background, I had assumed at the beginning that I'll need more preparation in Verbal than in Quant. It turned out to be partially true. 

For my first attempt in November 2020, I started preparation seriously in August first week. Before that I had already spent some money on Experts Global course, given 1-2 mock tests with passive preparation, and had acquainted myself with the exam structure etc. 

I started my CR prep with Powerscore CR - which was an amazing resource to start with. It was too long a read, because it explains everything in absolute detail, but it was worth it because it cleared my concepts about CR questions and how to approach them. With some practice, I could already see some improvement in CR. I was still not practicing pre-thinking though. Although I had a fair idea of what the right answers could be like. 
SC - I started with Manhattan SC book. It was good for grammar basics, but beyond a point, it didn't help much. I think SC is my strongest section today and I give full credit for that to GMAT Club community. I practiced a lot of SC Questions and analyzed every choice for every error in both the questions that I did right and wrong. Over time I created a framework for myself and practiced that framework on every question. While reading the sentence itself, I was able to identify the subject, verb, and different clauses in the sentence. Then while scanning for differences in the options, I could choose between the right and wrong options. Until this time, I wasn't absolutely clear about the meaning-based approach. 

RC - I will admit, I thought it will be the easiest bit and in the beginning, I didn't pay much attention to it. But by the end, RC is what became the bottleneck. I wasn't writing any notes in my RCs, I was reading the passage and comprehending up to 70% of it before I moved to answer choices. This approach, as I later found out, would not take me to V40+.

Quant - I was foolishly overconfident about this in the beginning. I thought that with little practice, I could get to Q50 and I wouldn't settle for anything lesser. But I was so underconfident about my quant preparation in the end that I got nervous in the exam. I still don't know how I managed to get even Q49. 

I gave one mock every weekend for 8-9 weeks and I finished all GMAT official mocks, a few free mocks by veritas, manhattan etc. because I didn't want to leave anything before the final exam. I was scoring 710-730 in my mocks. And I was aspiring for 750+. At 700, I rejected the score then and there and decided to give the exam again.

But I took a long break for some personal and work reasons and started the preparation in March end eventually by taking the e-gmat subscription.

Second Attempt -

I started from March end/April beginning. e-gmat team recommended that I give their Sigma-X mock first, so I did and scored 670 on that, I was out of practice after 4-5 months. I wanted to improve my RC in the beginning so I spent 2-3 weeks only on RC. Finished all RC modules that e-gmat had. I was severely lacking in my RC skills which improved only once I started taking notes and practiced e-gmat's method of solving RCs. It was revolutionary for me, and I'm not being paid to say this lol. 

I also knew about e-gmat's pre-thinking approach for CR and I wanted to see if it helped. After doing only a few question types with their standard pre-thinking approach, I could feel the difference. The understanding of the question and the answer that you're looking for becomes multifold once you pre-think the answer. It reduces the chances of errors, and improves speed eventually. I also started taking few notes in CR. 

After that, I started focusing on my quant too. I did a couple of their modules but frankly, it was taking too much time. I was impatient and always tried to jump the gun by skipping modules here and there. It ensured that I never got the concept right and always faltered in difficult questions in almost every concept. I realized this too late. After consecutively scoring 710-740 in my mocks, I realized that I am in the same situation as the last time, and I sought help from e-gmat. Dhananjay (DJ) from e-gmat got in touch with me, helped me make sense of my scores, and prepared a broad-level plan for me to reach my target of 750. I can say that I tried to follow his plan but I couldn't take the complete value out of that mentorship. I should have reached out to him more when I wasn't getting the desired results. I started giving custom quizzes every day and took a false sense of satisfaction in decent results in them. But the reality is, GMAT is tougher because of the actual exam pressure. 

I was confident that my preparation is such that I cannot score below 730. But I did. And for better or worse, I cannot settle at 710, so I will be giving my retest this month. DJ is still helping me with another customized plan and tells me that I have to follow it this time and I can reach my target score. :)

I'll let you guys know how it turns out.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=74#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Working in management consulting, I have received many different recommendations from my colleagues on how to best prepare for my GMAT exam. However, there was one of these recommended paths that most resonated to me: the e-gmat course. After taking the enhanced GMAT online and scoring 780 (Q: 50 V: 48 IR: 8 AWA: 6) I feel that I have to pass these recommendations to all my fellow gmatclubbers.

What I liked the most?
Hyper personalization
I was invited by Archit Bhargava to be part of LMP (Last Mile Program), a program where he would support me as a mentor. I cannot thank Archit enough for his support during my GMAT prep. He analyzed every single part of the Six Sigma X Mocks I took, beginning with my initial diagnosis one, and designed personalized improvement plans for each of the sections of the exam. He helped me understand where I had conceptual gaps, where I had to focus on process skills, and what areas I had already “conquered”. Archit also supported me until my exam day, helping me overcome any fall, to arrive at the GMAT with full confidence. Also, my GMAT study plan was designed so that it worked around my tight schedule of working 11+ hs a day.
Archit designed daily milestones for me to complete, taking into account the time that I had available for studying in the different days of the week.

Approach
e-GMAT has a very structured approach to achieve test readiness. Each of the subtopics of both Quant and Verbal is structured around a three-step learning process: (1) concept, (2) process, (3) GMAT skills. This method allows one to be certain of the readiness to move to the following step, and to calibrate the time dedicated to each subtopic in a very personalized way.

Platform
The Scholaranium 2.0 is a very powerful platform. It provides as many KPIs and metrics as one can imagine to identify the process flaws and knowledge gaps at a very detailed level to know exactly what to do to improve. It keeps track of the results for the different levels of questions. With Scholaranium 2.0, one can design custom quizzes and can even choose the subtopic! For example, one can design a quiz only on hard-level questions on modifiers within the SC section. The explanation of how questions should be resolved is very detailed and allows one to identify what went wrong or to confirm a correct. 

Sigma X Mocks
The Sigma X Mocks very well represent the real exam. The adaptative software makes the experience very similar to that of the GMAT. From my own personal experience, I can say these mock exams even have more difficult questions than the GMAT, which allows one to be confident that when preparing for this hard questions, one is for sure covering the difficulty that will be find in the exam. In my best Sigma X Mock I scored a 750 (Q50 V42) which translated into a 780 (Q50 V48) in the real exam. 

My study mentor: Archit
My journey would not have been the same without Archit. He was there to take my phone call at whatever hour each time I felt I would not make it in time, to adapt my study plan around my crazy work schedule, to help me define concrete next steps. Archit was the game changer in my GMAT journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=75#","4","0","","","","","",""

E-gmat has been a game changer for me. Its meaning based approach for SC and pre thinking approach for CR just puts verbal in your favour. Moreover, the master comprehension module just helps getting the base right.
The course is great for anyone starting their prep and wants to get into verbal. It is a very thorough course and along with the OG guides, it's the only prep material I used.
Scholaranium is the best tool available to any GMAT aspirant to judge your performance and find areas of improvement. It has amazing data analytics pointing to your need and area of improvement.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I took a diagnostic test from the official GMAT back in August 2020 and scored a 570. I knew I needed a course that will help me with all the aspects of the GMAT. I came across e-gmat and liked the trial version so went ahead and purchased the full course. 

The course is great for anyone starting at a similar level. It is a very thorough course and along with the OG guides, it's the only prep material I used. 

I think the verbal course is slightly better than the quant only because sometimes my approach to tackle quant was very different from e-gmat's. So I skipped some of the explanations and stuck to what I knew. Perhaps that would explain my Q49 score? Maybe I could have got a 50 or 51 by following the e-gmat approach? 

The verbal course, however, is the main reason for me scoring a V44 (from a V27 in my diagnostic). I highly recommend following the approach detailed in the e-gmat videos. 

I took my first attempt in May 2021 and scored a 690 (Q46 V39). I reached out to e-gmat for help. The 2 things I didn't do before my first attempt which were game changing was: 1) use the e-gmat scholaranium platform properly. I found the questions to be slightly harder than the official ones so i skipped it. In hindsight this was a bad decision. I think by practicing harder questions, you can really hone your approach to solving different types of questions. Also if you are targeting a high score, it makes sense to tackle the hard questions. 

The second thing I didn't do was keep an error log. I was encouraged by my e-gmat tutor to keep one. I initially found it time consuming and didn't see the benefit. However after repeatedly scoring 66% accuracy in CR, I decided to start an error log. I instantly saw my score improve. Obviously, you need to carry out a strategic review of your errors (not just keep one), e-gmat have lots of helpful videos for the error-log which are particularly helpful for the verbal section. I highly recommend. 

The 3 weeks between my 2 attempts, I exclusively used e-gmat's resources (scholaranium, error logs, strategic reviews) and this was what helped me increase my score to a 750. 

Another thing worth mentioning is e-gmats mentorship program. After my first attempt I was assigned a mentor who guided me with my prep. Aditee (e-gmat mentor) was very patient and helpful with my prep. Sometimes it helps when someone else can view your weaknesses objectively and direct you in the right way. 

I highly recommend e-gmat to anyone looking for a good overall prep course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=75#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Hi All,
My name is Pooja and I recently took the GMAT and after a year and half of constant hard work, repeated failures and a super stressful work environment I was able to score a 710 with V38 and Q49. I initially began my journey by self-studying and taking help from two other courses on separate occasions but I realized that none of them actually gave me the improvement I needed. After a few days of sever self-criticism and depression, I came across e-gmat. I tried its 7 day trial and I found that the free videos and lessons were already helping me figure out what incorrect approach or concept gaps I had (when I resolved a few incorrect questions I had attempted earlier). 
The first concept that absolutely blew my mind away is their staunch focus on meaning based approach in SC. Prior to that I always focused on splits and grammar which is fine for certain questions, but absolutely wrong for a majority of hard level questions. Once I adopted the strategy I observed that my application ability increased immensely compared to before and I was more comfortable approaching the questions. The best part about this is that the meaning based approach principles can also be applied while solving CR and RC questions. In verbal, I also loved their approach to pre-thinking using the falsification strategy (a true knight in shining armour I would say). 
In quant the lessons are so easy to understand and cover quite a few strategies which show their brilliance while solving hard level quant questions. I have always been weak in quant and have had a squeamish approach towards it. But e-gmat converted this feeling to confidence through their methods like maintaining error logs and conducting strategic reviews on every incorrect question. Originally maintaining an error log seems like a tedious process but soon you do get used to it and open your eyes to a whole new approach to your GMAT studies. 
In addition, I was approached by e-gmat for their mentorship program and jumped to undertake it as I really needed a second pair of eyes to understand the possible areas where I am faltering as I surely could not figure it out myself after 3 GMAT attempts. Here I was introduced to Archit Bhargava my mentor and in six months he completely changed my ways of dealing with the exam. I was given precise study schedules which covered what should be studied, revised or a quizzed based on my grasping ability. One of the major issues I faced was timing, despite being aware of the fact that when faced with a question were you are confused or unable to solve, just take an educated guess and move on. I, however never did that and it led me to sometimes spend 3 to 4mins on questions which resulted in a race to complete the quiz at the end. In order to tackle said issue, Archit suggested a timing matrix which tells you at what amount of time you should have completed what number of questions. Like for example: In quant when you are in question 10, the timer should be reading around 49mins.
This matrix really helped me. It took me a while to adapt it but with Archit’s constant support and my dedication to not give up on my weakness, I was able to adopt it. In my actual exam I managed to finish even the hard level questions which originally took me 3-4mins in 2mins as per ESR. 
I would genuinely recommend e-gmat as the course to undertake by all the GMAT novices as it is the perfect platform that can help you launch in the direction of your perfect score. They are not only focused on GMAT preparation but also provide support in areas like mental frustration. In addition anyone opting for the mentorship program should definitely choose Archit as their mentor because his structure and guidance is very straightforward and very helpful for students who are more anxiety driven. Two thumbs up for sure!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=75#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","After my third attempt in Jan 2021, my confidence was at its lowest and a 700+ score only seemed like a distant dream. This was until I met Dhananjay (DJ) who completely changed my outlook towards the exam. 

In our first call, he broke everything down for me from my ESR analysis and identified my gaps - RC was a weak area, there were some process gaps in SC and issues in quant which were collectively affecting my score. In addition to this, he also pointed out how my habit of not letting go of questions was keeping me away from achieving my target score. 

Since I had gone through the egmat course for verbal earlier, he did not ask me to go through everything again but rather made small achievable goals for me. 

I started with quant, as egmat launched its quant 2.0 course right around the time I started my prep. This was a total game changer. The course is extremely exhaustive and teaches you all the concepts you need to know along with the RIGHT PROCESS you should follow, which is key and something I didn't pay attention to earlier. I immediately began looking at my mistakes in quant in a different way - I could identify what step I made the mistake at - translation, inference, constraint, visualisation, simplification etc. 
After finishing each block in quant, I would update DJ and share my error log with him and he would send me an analysis and detailed next steps. 

For verbal, egmat taught me way more than just concepts:
- importance of meaning in SC
- visualization and prethinking in CR
- reading slowly by applying learnings from master comprehension in RC and making para summaries 

One difference in my prep this time around was the emphasis on error logs - both for quant and for verbal. I learnt that it's okay to make mistakes, but not to make the same mistake twice. In all my previous attempts, I was crazily chasing accuracy and was doing questions after questions. It didn't take me anywhere and I was stuck at 680-690.
Making a concrete error log and focusing on my mistakes is what took me to 710! Another helpful strategy was to really learn the art of letting go of questions, which is where DJ helped.

Key takeaways:
- Follow the egmat plan exactly as prescribed
- If you don't understand a concept, don't rush through and move to the next one. Understand it completely before moving forward. 
- Make error logs! They are supremely helpful
- Solving 100s of questions wont help, doing them right would
- Learn to let go of questions if you too are someone who struggles with timing 

Lastly, I want to take this opportunity to highlight that this won't have been possible without DJ - the first call he had with me to analyse my ESR and share an action plan and the countless videos and emails he shared with me analysing all my mistakes, timing, scholaranium stats!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=75#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","It's my third go at GMAT and I've finally got a score, which falls in my desired bracket. I've scored a 640(Q48 V30) and 670(Q50 V29) in my previous two attempts. I just couldn't fathom my scores, because I did considerably well on the official GMAT mocks. But after a thorough analysis of my ESRs, I understood that the approach I had is not enough to fetch me high scores. After taking around 4 months of break, I again started planning for my third attempt. That's when I've decided to purchase e-gmat's online course.

Some of the best things I've learned while using the e-gmat course:

1. Meaning based approach for solving Sentence Correction problems - Knowing in our mind that meaning is an important aspect in SC while solving the questions is one thing and having an approach which encapsulates that step and makes it a second nature while solving the questions is another thing. I have missed this trick in both of my previous attempts. e-gmat does an amazing job in this aspect and the questions in scholaranium polish our skills in using this approach.

2. Visualisation and Proper understanding of the conclusion for answering Critical Reasoning Questions - I cannot stress this enough. Even if pre-thinking is not feasible for each and every question, if we can visualise the passage well and have a proper understanding of the conclusion, it will open doors to the correct answer.

3. Analytics provided by Scholaranium - Two aspects standout the most with scholaranium. The detailed analysis provided for all the practise you do and the quality of the questions. If you don't have a proper approach, then the questions you solve in scholaranium will let you know that.

4. Mocks - (Note: Unpopular opinion incoming) I am not a huge fan of the official mocks. In my view, the Sigma-X mocks are more closer to the actual exam than the 6 official mocks. I think the official mocks can only get you around maybe 670/680 in the actual exam. I've scored 730-750 in my official mocks, only to score 640 and 670 in both my attempts. But my sigma-X mock scores are around 720-750, which more or less is same as my actual score. The insights you get after the exam will definitely help you identify the weak areas you have and thus make your preparation efficient.

5. LMP - Having a mentor who can guide you down the right path would definitely help you after those 2 horrific experiences. I gotta thank DJ here. He definitely knows what works for a student, and he is quite fast in responding to the mails😌.

Because I am doing well at quant, I didn't do much of the quant courses and focused my preparation mostly on verbal. But the quant quizzes are definitely challenging. Taking a quant quiz once in three days during the prep would definitely keep up your skill-level.

I would like to thank DJ for his efforts and his consistent support. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn't even have the courage to book my exam, thank you for that😄. All in all, I would recommend this course for someone who just hates grammatical-fancy-jargons.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=75#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi Friends,

I had stumbled upon e–GMAT course on GMAT club during my early days of GMAT preparation. There were a lot of good reviews about the course and they looked genuine. Soon I attended a free workshop organised by them wherein they discussed about the GMAT straight strategy on how to score above 700. 

Although I was apprehensive about an online course as I had never attended an online course but the Covid -19 situation made it the right choice for me. I had a zoom call with e-Gmat team about the various questions that I had regarding the course and GMAT. Once all my questions were answered satisfactorily , I decided to enroll for the course. Now having achieved a GMAT score of 700 I can say it was indeed the right decision for me to invest my time and money In the E – GMAT preparation course.

Based on my experience, some of the salient features of the e– GMAT are: 

1. Strong verbal GMAT course: The e– GMAT is already known for its fabled verbal course. It is highly effective covers everything that one needs to know and follows an easy approach towards learning. The concepts like breaking down of an argument into premises , counter premises , conclusion et cetera and the pre- thinking concepts turn out to be very useful in the CR. The concept of active reading where you are immersed into the argument or the passage helps not just in critical reasoning but also in the reading comprehension section.
2. Greatly improved GMAT quant: The e– GMAT quant course wasn’t as good its verbal course when I had just enrolled but in the last few months the course has improved substantially. It is so comprehensive and elaborative that even a student who is not a pro in mathematics will be able to solve GMAT problems easily once he/she understands the concepts and the tips and tricks taught in the Quant course . it is the best improvement done in the last few months.
3. Freedom and flexibility: the online course comes with the benefits of freedom to learn anywhere and the flexibility to learn as per one’s own convenience. This is specially true for working professionals like me. The fact that the course is module-based makes it easy to start off from the point you last left.
4. Scholaranium : One of my favourite part of this course is scholaranium which has a vast collection of GMAT like questions for that additional practice one needs to master various question types and concepts. It also allows one to customise questions based on topics and difficulty levels.
5. Sigma – X mock tests: these tests are very similar to actual GMAT tests in this course you get are generally a fair representation of your likely GMAT score. I generally scored around 720–730 in my Sigma X mock tests and 700 in GMAT.
6. Prompt response from e-GMAT team: during the entire course the eGmat team was very proactive and quick to reply to any doubts about the course, individual questions or about the strategy to improve my performance. Generally the team replies within 24 hours of receiving the mail from you so it helps because you can keep getting course correction whenever you need and the response is prompt.

Finally, I would like to recommend all the prospective GMAT takers that  e–GMAT offers a comprehensive, effective and flexible way to learn and master your GMAT prep. Please attend their free webinar or zoom call before you buy any online prep course. My only suggestion is to be calm and confident while taking the test as it does play an important role in your performance. E – GMAT provides all there is to learn about GMAT and my 30 points dropped from SigmaX score is  primarily attributable to the exam centre stress. So please be calm, prepare well and give your best shot. 

Good luck to everyone!

																			by score report","Points","Location","After a few months of unstructured prep and no improvements or understanding of my strengths and weaknesses, I came across the one of the eGMAT debriefs on youtube. After going through a few debriefs, I realised that the key component of GMAT prep is structure. While I had initially signed up for eGMAT just to add structure to my prep, the course offered so much more. A lot of which I was totally unaware of.
Key Strength:
I want to start with the strongest suite of the eGMAT course. The Sentence Correction module. It is hands down the best out there with no close second. The SC module is curated so beautifully to get you an in-depth understanding of the concepts of sentence correction while keeping you engaged. I remember when I started the SC module, I spent about 22 hours on it in the first week without even realising it. While a lot of GMAT courses get carried away from the grammar aspect of SC, eGMAT, with its meaning based approach, does a very good job of reminding the students that the verbal section on GMAT is called Verbal REASONING  and not GRAMMAR.
Without exaggerating even one bit, It is THE BEST course out there and if you are someone who is struggling with sentence correction, take a leap of faith with eGMAT and you will not regret it one bit.

The CR module, eGMAT does a very good job of making the students go through the Master Comprehension module before delving into the details of the CR and RC course. This acquired skill of UNDERSTANDING what you're reading combined with the eGMAT Pre Thinking approach helped with the really tough CR questions.
The RC course, again my biggest weakness on RC was skimming without understanding the meaning of what I read, The eGMAT application files pushed me to maintain the balance between skimming and over reading, thus helping me save time and improve accuracy on RCs.

The Quant course, being an Engineer, Quant was my strength on the test but after a few mocks, I realised that there were certain conceptual gaps in my preparation. The eGMAT course definitely helped with that. The overall level of eGMAT quant is higher than the actual test so it prepares you for the tougher questions. 
 
Moving on to the strongest suite for TEST READINESS out there, Scholaranium 2.0 with its flexibility to create custom quizzes and its data backed insights is a beautiful platform to improve your ability to test yourself. The quality of explanation for each right as well as wrong answer just add to the perks of the platform.

Sigma X Mocks, On a personal note, I feel the sigma X mocks are the right representation of the actual test, I would even go on to say that the official mocks are a bit easier than the actual exam. The quality of questions on the Sigma X mocks along with the adaptive algorithm do a very good job at simulating the test taking experience.
Having said that, in my GMAT journey the key has been the support that I have received from eGMAT, their Last Mile program gets you in touch with brilliant mentors like Dhananjay (can't thank him enough) who help you with hyper specific feedback, personalised improvement plans and support to just help you maximise your potential on test day. 
On that note, I would say my experience with eGMAT was nothing short of amazing and I would strongly recommend every test taker out there to go for the course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","After scoring a disappointing 610 (Q47V27) on my first attempt, I identified 3 key areas on which I had to work on to improve my GMAT score.

1) Verbal, as I scored very low on it and I knew I was having conceptual gaps.
2) Speed, I was not able to finish any of the sections and simply had to guess the last 3-4 questions in each section.
3) Stamina, I was exhausted halfway through the verbal section which was my second section.

To overcome the above, I knew I had to give mock tests and need to get a verbal course,

I did my research and e-gmat stood out when it came to verbal preparation, so I planned to enrolled to the Verbal course of e-gmat, however, I ended up enrolling to the entire course (Verbal +Quant) after I heard about the scholaranium section of e-gmat because I knew I had to practice quant with time limits setup.

It turned out to be quite a good decision as I was able to increase my score by 80 points to 690 (Q47V39) with a massive improvement of 12 points in the verbal section.

Using e-gmat, I attacked the 3 key areas I had identified.

1) Verbal: The modules for SC and CR are exceptional, they really helped in understanding the key concepts which I was missing. In terms of RC, I was able to grasp some new concepts in it, however not as much as in the SC and CR section. For RC, I think it's just about being a good reader, so I just worked on improving my reading skills by reading random articles and practicing on E-Gmat scholaranium. The verbal course is very well structured overall, there are concepts videos, quizzes, application quizzes, cementing quizzes and the scholaranium, also the explanation for every question is very thorough. I followed the approach that e-gmat team guided me with and it helped me a lot.

2) Speed: From my perspective, the best and most powerful thing about e-gmat is the scholaranium, this tool is a blessing. I used scholaranium to get my timing right, in the scholaranium you can create your custom quiz and give short exams setting up a timing limit, I really found it very very helpful, not only it allowed me to practice and get my timing right but also it allowed me to give quick short exams in between my busy work schedule. They have a huge pool of questions with different difficulty levels, I found the questions slightly more difficult than what I got in actual gmat which was perfect as it made the Gmat test look slightly easier. The dashboard of scholaranium was also very helpful, I was able to identify my weaknesses using it and work on them.

3) Stamina: I got access to 6 adaptive tests which helped me work on my stamina, again the adaptive tests were slightly more difficult than the actual gmat, the highest i scored on e-gmat mock test was 670, on the official gmat mock test i had scored 710 and on the test day I scored 690.

Overall, I am very thankful to the e-gmat team for providing support wherever required, I asked numerous questions on different modules which e-gmat experts replied to and helped me clarify my doubts.

If you are someone who is looking to improve on verbal and who is looking for some practice to improve speed and stamina, I would strongly recommend e-gmat, their verbal course as well as scholaranium has really helped me and I hope it will help you too.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","1","0","","","","","",""

e-GMAT changed the game for me - their lectures were super insightful and very easy to follow and retain concepts. I really liked the course on SC which really helped me solidify these concepts. The application files and review files which feature between various concepts ensures that you retain what you've learned.

e-GMAT also teaches a strategic review process which is one the most sophisticated forms of maintaining an error log. Strategic review is what really helped me improve on my mistakes and build confidence as I answered problems in their Scholaranium (which has a very good and large set of questions).

The last piece I would like to highlight is the mentorship - they assigned me Atreya Roy who was supremely helpful in guiding me through the process. The mentorship program helped me analyze my tests and quizzes with a fine tooth comb and identify concept gaps at a sub-topic level. He also helped me 'break out of a rut' every time I faced roadblocks by suggesting various targeted exercises. I also really appreciate the motivation and support provided by these mentors - really helps ride through pre-exam anxiety.

All in all - I have recommended e-GMAT to all my peers who have faced similar issues with GMAT, and are looking to improve their score by 50-60 points.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","4","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

I reviewed the entire sentence correction twice and every time I walked away with something new in terms of learning. I was able to identify my knowledge gap and build on the skills that were lacking. I did questions from algebra part of quant and enjoyed doing those questions too.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I came across E-GMAT’s course when I was struggling with CR with just a week to go for my first GMAT attempt. I got to attend a free webinar and I really loved the use of pre-thinking, a concept that I hadn’t come across before. My CR score immediately improved in just 2 days. Unfortunately, I had other skill gaps and ended up scoring only 640(Q44 V34) in my first attempt at GMAT. My prep had been very random, without any structure and I wasn't able to figure out what was going wrong and I decided to give E-GMAT a shot because I liked the way the course was structured. 

Within a month of using the platform to learn and practise questions my score improved to 700 and then to 720 in my mocks and stayed there for a while. However, things didn’t go well in my second attempt too as I wasn’t mentally prepared to take the test then and I got a 660 (Q48 V33). My third attempt was just 16 days after this attempt and I was completely down but I religiously followed the strategy laid out by DJ (E-GMAT Mentor). Thankfully, everything went well and I got a 700 (Q49 V35).

Some aspects of the course that really worked for me – 

# The Verbal section of the course is really good. E-GMAT emphasizes on the importance of understanding the right approach to solve questions. Whether it is the meaning-based approach in SC or pre-thinking in CR, once you understand and master the approach, the entire process of solving Verbal questions becomes more enjoyable and effective!

# One thing that I loved about their Verbal course was that it became easy to understand why the wrong answer choices were wrong. Every question and answer choice had a detailed explanation and understanding the same made it a lot easier to pick the right answer even though it might seem wrong at first. This is particularly useful when you are stuck with the last two choices, especially in 700-level questions.

# The Quant section was detailed and covered almost all the important topics with an emphasis on conceptual clarity. There are multiple quizzes in every single topic that when you finish a module you would have covered every possible type of question that could be asked and that too in a way that you become super comfortable with the topics. Again, detailed explanations for every question and answer choice helped me a lot as I needed that extra bit of understanding. 
I would say that my quant score improved from 44 to 49 only because of the conceptual clarity and variety in terms of practise that I got from the course. 

 # My favourite part of E-GMAT is SCHOLARANIUM 2.0, their question bank with its precise analytics. It has a wide range of questions in every single topic and for each level of difficulty that enables you to get enough practise and also to  get test-ready. It also has multiple types of quizzes with accurate analytics. Just observing the analytics provided there made me understand what kind of mistakes I was doing and what my weak areas were, time and again. It made my practise really easy and effective because I didn’t have to waste time on deciding what material to use, where to hunt for satisfactory explanations, analyse my error-types and weak areas - Scholaranium 2.0 was doing all of this for me. Just one thing here, make sure that you use it effectively – focus on quality over quantity.

# DJ's Mentorship -  I am really thankful for the support that I got throughout my prep period from DJ  (Mentor at E-GMAT). He would analyse each of my Sigma-X mocks and give a thorough de-brief of what went right and what went wrong. His suggestions and tips really made me effectively focus on areas that needed improvement. This is something I couldn’t figure out when I was prepping by myself. DJ’s support especially helped me push through the last leg when my score hit a plateau and I lost my motivation. When we figured out that I am not able to perform as effectively on the actual exam as on my mocks, he asked me a lot of questions and finally devised a strategy that would help me during the exam to stay more focused and guess what, it did! 
DJ laid out weekly plans that were tailor made for my requirements and following these plans really helped break the frustrating plateau. It honestly helps to have someone guide you this way to inch towards your target score, in my opinion!

Overall, my experience with the course has been great! I used the course to the maximum extent possible and it honestly helped me finally get to 700. 

If you are someone who is looking for good conceptual clarity , structure in your prep, a solid question bank with really good analytics, and constant support you can definitely consider E-GMAT.

All the very best :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","Let me take you through my GMAT preparation journey.

I took my first GMAT attempt without entirely appreciating the depth of the ocean called GMAT and rather unsurprisingly I drowned without getting close to my target.

It was a proper jolt and I quickly realized that I needed help to get over the GMAT hurdle. Thankfully by that time GMAT Club was my trusted guide and going through the GMAT Club community, looking for members who did well on the GMAT and the resources they used, the name that kept popping up was that of e-GMAT.

So I reached out to e-GMAT and my first interaction with the team was the free e-GMAT one-on-one ESR review where I was blown away by the depth of insights that the mentor was able to derive from the ESR. I went ahead and booked my subscription to the e-GMAT platform on the same day.

Thankfully, the platform was all I could hope for and more. Not only did the coursework have a lot of depth, the ample amount of application files and practice files meant that I could cement a lot of the concepts in the first phase of preparation itself.

Talking of specific courses, in Verbal CR was always my Achilles heel and the e-GMAT concepts of pre-thinking and spending more time with the question stem, properly analysing and breaking down every part of it proved to be a gamechanger for me. In addition to this, in SC understanding the meaning-based approach gave me an extra weapon in my arsenal to go along with process of elimination to deal with SC questions with more confidence.

But the most crucial value addition of the e-GMAT platform is in the Scholaranium 2.0 section. From my experience, beyond a point, most people struggle to raise their score or get out of a rut that they are caught in because they aren't able to figure out where they are going wrong and this is because they are unable to perform structured and deep-rooted analysis of their mistakes. This is where Scholaranium 2.0 comes in handy and acts as a personal guide, walking you through every mistake, every block, every topic that needs further work. The interactive charts help you map out your ability improvement across sections and sub-sections as time progresses. It tells you which kind of questions are draining most of your time and how can you go about correcting them. It really makes life as a student very convenient and answers the what and how when it comes to making improvements in prep strategy.

Besides, what sets e-GMAT apart is how responsive the mentors and experts on the platform are in responding to student queries. In my personal experience, I have never had to wait for more than 24 hours to get a response to my queries, and just the mere knowledge that there are experts ready and willing to promptly respond to your doubts and queries leads to a much more relaxed and focused prep.

So to close the loop, I would highly recommend e-GMAT to anyone who is in the GMAT prep journey and is looking for a comprehensive platform to cater to all their prep needs.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I had the opportunity to be a part of e-GMAT's LMP mentorship program. I started preparing after enrolling myself in the e-GMAT course. This itself took some time as I had to go through various demo classes by other institutes and obviously chose the best finally.

Reasons for choosing e-GMAT: 
1. As a working professional, I do not have much time for attending live classes. Also, recorded classes do not make sense to me. e-GMAT 's concept file format and practice/application quiz after each concept appealed to me greatly. 
2. I gave  the first free sigma-x mock from e-GMAT's portal to gauge my level before starting the preparation in which I had scored 600. I approached the e-GMAT team with the same and they were very helpful in providing insights and how to proceed further.

Talking more about the course:
SC: Best in the market filled with slicing approaches. Clear and crisp meaning-based approach with zero corner cutting strategy. Each answer is explained as to why it is correct and other choices wrong. Not that it is important, but this course will help you eliminate apps like Grammarly if you have them 😊 
CR: This course will truly clear the doubts in terms of logical gaps if any. The best part about CR course is its pre-thinking approach and understanding of what exactly has been asked and protects you from falling in traps which may be contextually similar but is very different from what the question demands.
RC: Honestly, this was my favorite as I feared this one the most. I have a slow reading speed. But what this course did for me is that it taught me to extract the meaning very efficiently as I read. There are multiple passage explanations which analyzes in depth why the author has written this sentence and what is the intent behind it. It actually builds your muscle memory of searching for transition words and linking the previous part to the next one that you are about to read. 
Quant: The question level exactly matches of the final examination. The OG questions are somewhat easy compared to what is asked. I would recommend to at least practice the questions from the wonderfully curated Scholaranium 2.0 for quant (and of course Verbal) to improve the score.

After 3 months of preparation and finishing the Verbal and Quant portion, I went on to give my 2nd Sigma-x mock. I wrote to the e-GMAT team again for how to proceed with mock strategy. This is when Archit, an expert from the e-GMAT team approached me for the e-GMAT Mentorship program – the Last Mile Push. 
Archit went through each of my mock performances and gave me suggestions of where I am exactly faltering. He went through the process of making a personalized video for me after each mock and mentioned the exact reasons for score dip. The personalized feedback of where I am lacking and what are the exact things I need to revise and focus on helped me to stay on track without losing time. Also, the insights he gave helped me to improve my sigma-x mock performances from 680 to 750 (Average score of 720 which is close to my final score)

I would surely recommend e-GMAT to any serious aspirant.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Since I started my preparation with E-Gmat itself, my verbal concepts were fairly clear. The meaning based approach to sentence correction and the pre-thinking approach to CR questions proved to be an optimal technique to solve GMAT verbal questions.

I used the quant sections to brush up my maths since my undergrad course did not have a math component. It  proved to be a boon for students looking to refresh their math concepts from scratch.

The best part though about the E-GMAT course was the scholaranium that provided insights into my mistakes and provide me actionable steps to improve my performance. I can't thank the E-GMAT enough for their constant encouragement and involvement to improve my score further.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I purchased the eGMAT course after my 2nd official try, in which I scored a 710 (Q48, V40). I felt I was close to my target score but not quite. After reading reviews online, I settled on eGMAT as the course to help me with my final push on what would eventually be my last official try.

eGMAT shares personalized plans on the basis of an ESR/ most recent mock test and puts you in touch with a mentor (thank you DJ!) who guides you through the process. I got a 2 week plan, with the focus in the 1st week on ironing out some kinks and the focus in the 2nd week on practicing and cementing methods. The meaning based approach in SC is very helpful and the diagnostic quizzes in each Quant module enable one to complete the course at one's pace. In my opinion, the SigmaX mocks are harder than the Official mocks and the Official exam, but it's always a good thing to be prepared for something harder than the actual version.

I got a 30 point improvement in ~2 weeks. If you stick to the plan, know your starting point and your target score, an improvement in a short span of time is possible. However, don't expect the eGMAT team to simply wave a magic wand and help you get your desired result - you will have to put in the team and your timelines to hit your target score will depend on your starting point.

I would recommend eGMAT to individuals who feel like they need external support through the GMAT journey and to those individuals who are at the last hurdle of their GMAT prep and just need to improve some processes to get to the end goal.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I got introduced to the e-GMAT platform on GMAT Club whilst I was looking for resources to help me improve my score by a couple of points to reach 99th percentile. I had used a few different test prep resources in the past but those test prep resources lacked the structure and analytics that e-GMAT provides. For the same price, e-GMAT’s course is structured in a very methodical manner, with the opportunity to receive direct mentoring and a very specific study plan suited for your target score. I have had the privilege of working directly with DJ (Dhananjay Lowe) from e-GMAT, who has been a great support so far. I remember reaching out to him a couple of months ago and received an immediate response. He laid out my strengths and weaknesses and devised an action plan for me, which made it very easy to for me to track areas I needed to work on and the level of improvement that I should be targeting.

I would also like to highlight the CR technique that is unique to e-GMAT and honestly a game changer. The pre-thinking approach, although slightly tricky to adhere to at first, ensures that your approach to CR questions is very logical and ensures a high level of success. Moreover, the e-GMAT quant course is definitely one of the best out there - the syllabus armours you with enough skills to tackle the hardest level GMAT questions. Although I thought I knew all the concepts in Quant before signing up for e-GMAT, I was surprised at the nuances in techniques and skills for different topics quant that I wasn’t even aware of before going through the e-GMAT course! 

Finally, Scholaranium 2.0, e-GMAT’s interactive question bank, is definitely unparalleled when it comes to preparing in timed conditions. The topic by topic split helps you isolate your weaknesses and tackle them. The sheer number of questions and video explanations for almost all the questions show just how much effort has gone into building this and is definitely the best you can find in the market. What I also liked about e-GMAT’s question bank is the flexibility to select the topic you want to focus on that a lot of other test prep companies do not have. 

The Sigma-X mocks are also slightly harder than the actual GMAT exam, and hence the perfect prepping tool given the actual Official GMAT test prep mock exams are slightly easier than the actual exam in my experience. 

I do hope that more people sign up to e-GMAT as I continue to work with DJ towards my target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=76#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

I did not waste any time or energy exploring any other service providers as I knew how amazingly e-gmat taught it’s verbal content, so I went ahead with the e-gmat complete test preparation package, and I was lucky to have Archit assigned as the mentor for me during the course. 
After getting a very specific analysis of my first Sigma-X mock (600, Q44, V28), Archit recommended I follow the CR & RC course, which would create a good base for increasing my Verbal score, along with cementing my quant and SC concepts. He provided step by step guidance on what to do when and how long should it ideally take to complete that step. Upon completing this course I felt a lot more confident answering Verbal questions, it started to become a second nature to me and I could improve my quant efficiency by a lot. However, my speed was not up to the mark and missed a few questions when I attempted the next e-sigma mocks. Archit provided guidance on how to improve TAKT time and move past the ridiculously tough questions. Archit mentored me very carefully throughout the last few days of preparation, which helped me to really get the most out of my time. This included a very specific video-analysis of my most recent mock test which pinpointed the lowest hanging fruits as well as coming with a step-by-step plan for the last 3 days. 2 days before the exam, Archit gave me quick tips on how to be well prepared for the online exam set-up, which really helped me as I was most nervous about the online set-up.
I am grateful to Archit to help score well in my GMAT exam, it was very useful to have someone who could provide the right strategy to study and improve the score. He provided a lot of feedback by providing a lot of insights from my performances in the quizzes and mocks. I would highly recommend the e-gmat program for all the GMAT test-takers because I feel it will definitely save you from all the hassle and doubts about the GMAT exam, prep strategy and mentors here will provide proper guidance.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My GMAT score was stuck between 640-660 from last three years. I had taken the egmat subscription earlier , but i did not utilize it fully that time because of my overconfidence. 

After my 6th attempt in Dec-2020, I was completely devastated. I was not able to figure out what was lacking in my prep. I thought to give up on GMAT. Luckily, while searching for GMAT debriefs I came across one of the egmat’s debrief with title ""730 on 6th Attempt” by Vinayak.  Had I not seen that 1 hour debrief, I would not have attempted GMAT again. After seeing the debrief, I realised that I need expert’s advice. So I reached out to egmat team for the first time for help.

The detailed ESR analysis and feedback by DJ- gave me a ray of hope. Without further delay, I enrolled for the course again and this time with a ""BEGINNER'S MIND""

How egmat changed my entire study approach and utimately my verbal ability for my last attempt?

1. Verbal course content - ""TO GET THE CONCEPTS CORRECT AND MITIGATE APPLICATION GAPS"" 

Example- 

a) SC- Meaning based approach improved my SC accuracy and the timing to solve question was reduced.
Egmat verbal expert Shraddha'S SC videos are just great!! It gave me right approach for SC. I always used to listen her in-detail analysis of SC Questions.

b) CR- I never knew before that mastering assumption type question is key to other kinds of CR questions(Evaluate/Strenghten/Weaken)
Prethink - helped me to comprehend and visualise the passage clearly
C) RC- Para summary and linking the para contents.
Egmat verbal expert Harshavardhan's video solutions were very helpful for me to correct my approach for CR/RC questions and for prethinking.

2. Scholaranium and Questions forum- ""TO GAUGE PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSE WEAK AREAS""

There are three kinds of quiz : Cementing, Custom and Ability quiz.
I used cementing quiz to strengthen the topics i was weak at. Custom quiz - for when I wanted to do mixed set of question types.

Scholaranium 2.0 also had great features like statistics of my performance. For instance- after each quiz I got a review list( with comparsion between recommended and actual time u took).It was much easier to pick the questions for review.

The main advantages of practising questions in Scholaranium were :I got detailed solutions and systematic approach from egmat-experts to solve each question; if i had doubts i used to go through all the past queries from different students ; Many a times i had posted my own queries and the replies from Verbal experts-Harshavardhan/Bikramjit/Stacey/Aarthi were to the point and cleared my concepts.

3. Egmat strategy support team - "" TO SEEK IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND FEEDBACK""

At one point i felt even after completing the intense verbal course my scores in scholarnium were not up to the mark.So,I reached out to the egmat support team for help.

The most important advice I got was from Archit(Egmat strategy team member) . I am just copying his words as is “Identify Root cause –Strategically review the last 30 questions you have d one in CR(any quiz taken). This is non-negotiable. Create an error log, make notes and revise both.""
I started to see patterns in my mistakes. Slowly, I was able to see that I was making similar kind of  mistakes repeteadly. I followed the same approach for all verbal and quant sub-sections.For a particular section/subsection, I revised all my previous error logs (even 4 months old error logs) before my next study session/quiz . My main aim during the process was “NOT TO REPEAT ANY MISTAKE”. I followed this method deligently and it worked like magic for me :)

I strategically reviewed two types of questions as suggested by Nava and Archit(Egmat strategy team members) 

i)Incorrect ones - What was the root cause that I made this mistake
ii)Correct questions solved in more than recommended time(TAKT time) - Why did I take more time? Was it the comprehension issue? Or Options visualisation issue? or something else

4. Egmat Bookmark and Notes features - "" TO REVISE FREQUENTLY""

5. Egmat Webinars - ""TO LISTEN FROM EGMAT EXPERTS, GET A GROUP STUDY FEELING  AND KEEP THE MOMENTUM OF STUDY""
   The weekly webinars by egmat team are just a great initiative to engage students. Through those webinars i got more insights about certain concepts and strategies.

6. Last Week unexpected help from egmat-  just  1 week before my GMAT date. They invited me for the egmat milestone program, and even though only 1 week was left for my exam I enrolled for it ( because this time I wanted all the help I can get). Atreya Roy was my mentor. He analysed my last mock and provided me 1 week improvement plan and sequence of execution for topics to study. This last minute help gave a extra confidence for the actual GMAT day.

I would not have achieved 700+ without egmat’s extended support.

I have learnt that it's important to seek help and learn from other’s mistakes. Life is too short to make them all yourself.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","1","0","","","","","",""

Having been a bright student throughout school and university, I couldn't settle with such a low score. Soon, I came across the ESR Analysis service provided by e-GMAT and signed up for it. They scheduled a video call with an expert who helped me analyse my ESR thoroughly and meanwhile, I registered for the e-GMAT free course post which I decided to enrol for the full course.

The e-GMAT prep program stands out in terms of - 
1. Meaning based approach for solving Sentence Correction problems - The emphasis is not just on correcting grammar but also on making sure that the chosen answer choice conveys the intended meaning per the original sentence.
2. Visualisation and Pre-thinking for answering Critical Reasoning Questions - Dissecting the argument in terms of background information, premise, and conclusion helps understand given information better.
3. Process Skills for solving Quant questions - I feel just applying formulae consumes a lot of time while attempting hard Quant problems. So, application and process skills need to be sharpened to reach your optimal potential.
4. Analytics provided by Scholaranium - The tool keeps a track of accuracy and average time you spend on questions (question-type wise, subsection wise and section wise). Each question is supplemented with detailed explanation which helps you solidify your concepts as you get to check your thought process behind rejecting options and choosing the correct one.
5. Mocks and LMT Program - Sigma-X Mocks provide great insights into your performance and as and when you attempt a mock, your mentor helps you analyse it further and provides the course of action ahead.

On scoring scoring 700 (Q50 V34], I had a chat with DJ to discuss the specifics of the exam I had appeared for and to chart the plan ahead. He believed in my abilities and was of the opinion that I could have done much better. So, he advised me to take another shot at the GMAT in 16 days. This time he took up one micro issue at a time and provided a plan to sort it out. For example, I was facing a problem with Humanities RC Passages so he suggested me to read about 2-3 articles from any reputed newspaper daily for about 2 weeks and this really improved my Takt Time and accuracy. Further, this time the plan wasn't as hectic as the last one and it just involved 3 mocks with strategic review and revision of notes. It felt as if I was doing too less but DJ had the optimal plan to pull up my score and he was confident about it. As per the charted plan, I booked a date for the exam and ended up scoring the coveted 740 (Q50 V 40).

I would like to thank DJ from e-GMAT for consistent support and guidance all through the process. He helped me analyse my sectional tests and mocks. He also provided video feedback for the first two mocks, explaining the areas that need improvement and created a hyper-specific plan. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor.

e-GMAT is a one stop platform for your GMAT prep needs. You are covered in terms of concepts, application skills, and even periodic motivation; you just need to be disciplined and follow the plan.

Useful Tips:
1. Start your GMAT preparation with a target score and make a precise plan and stick to it.
2. Take notes of the points you'd like to revisit and add the questions you get wrong or spend extra time on to error logs (E-gmat provides templates), I cannot emphasise this enough. It played a huge role in preparation.
3. Do not rush to solve questions as the question bank has only a limited number of questions. Focus on understanding and internalising the concepts first.
4. Learn the art of letting go questions. I learnt this the hard way. Spending say more than 4 minutes on a quant question is not wise until you have those extra minutes in hand as you'll end up skipping the questions you might know to finish the test in time.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

The main USP of the course structure is its focus on meaning based approach and learning from the problems solved. In the GMAT preparation, probably the most vital step is hard work in the right direction, and for me E-GMAT was that partner for me.

Although I was scoring well on Quants, Verbal was a major issue. I was struggling to cross 32-34 range. I had borrowed some other prep work and practiced OG questions but nothing seemed to help. I came across E-GMAT and then thought of taking the 1 week trial. I liked the feedback points that they give and try to drill the solution method in every module that you do. I personally saw a lot of benefit with the structured approach that E-GMAT teaches. 
The analysis on which topics to target and the AI based study plan were good starting points. 
I had only taken the coursework for about 4 weeks before focusing on the Mock tests, and was not able to use the quant prep as much. However, I would surely suggest this course if you are looking for 90+ percentile scores on verbal at the very least. 
Overall, if you are struggling to target the right weakness, I would strongly suggest E-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","0","0","","","","","",""
"June 16, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","E-Gmat Course Review","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","So My journey with GMAT started in Feb when I bought the E-Gmat subscription as suggested by a friend. It took me around 3-4 months to give my first attempt on GMAT and score a 720 (V38 Q50). I had given one official GMATPrep Mock before starting my preparation and scored a 670 (V31Q49). So that shall give you an idea where I was before beginning my attempt. I used only the E-Gmat course and Official Guides for my preparation. Apart from these 2 I used to practice GMATClub practice question banks occasionally as well but I seriously do not think they helped me much. 

I will talk about how the course helped me:

SC: This was my weakest area in verbal, but I think E-Gmat's course is as fundamental as one needs to build his/her grammatical concepts. The way the course starts from the most basic blocks and build on most complicated concepts like modifiers is great. I do not think one needs to supplement this course with anything else. Once you have learnt all the fundamentals from this course, what is left is just how well you apply those fundamentals. There again E-GMAT does a great job in laying out a process for you to follow. Meaning is super important in GMAT SC and I have learned this the hard way. If you can develop a knack of comprehending the intending meaning early on, as the E-Gmat course teaches, applying grammatical concepts will become way easier. I suggest taking this aspect super seriously from the first sentence you read in your prep. Once you have built a habit of rushing through the meaning analysis part, it is very tough to train your mind to go the other way round. I still struggle with that just because I was complacent about this aspect in the beginning.

The questions scholoranium provides for SC encompasses all fundamental concepts of grammar application. If you do all of them and get 100% learning from their explanations, you will rarely learn anything new on SC. The only area of improvement I see here is that meaning based or rather hard meaning based questions in E-GMAT are a little less and those get tested heavily in GMAT.

CR: The CR course again is super conceptual. The way the course covers each question type is great and can help anyone learn from the scratch. The best take away from E-GMAT's CR course was Pre-Thinking. Though the term gets used in the GMAT world like a scientific concept, but it is not. It is a super elegant/simple way of solving CR problems. It is because of this simplicity that many students just ignore its importance (like me). I learnt from E-GMAT how important it is to read the question stem slowly and carefully and plan your line of attack. The E-Gmat course stresses on reading the stimulus as thoroughly as possible and I do not think there is any better advice possible for CR questions. I still fail on questions but only when I rush through the stimulus or through prethinking. Pre-Thinking becomes natural after a while, so you may need a little patience there. I don't think one needs to anticipate an answer in prethinking, planning a line of attack is just fine. Once you are sure about your line of attack, irrelevant options/ trap options would be visible to you. Thanks to this approach, by the end of my Prep CR had been my strongest suit. 

RC: Even though I considered SC my weakest area, it turned out that RC was as weak as SC for me. Somewhere it still is weak. I was neither a voracious nor a fast reader. All my life I had read just simple texts. Even the books I used to read before GMAT Prep were mostly non fiction and had very simplistic language. E-GMAT course again offered the best advice of reading slowly upfront and understanding the passage thoroughly before going to questions. You may find other techniques such as reading passages in 2.5- 3 mins with 70% understanding and then rereading information each question asks but I strongly feel those strategies work only for people who already are good readers, who would anyways do good on RC. I tried all the approaches and worked super hard on RCs but the only approach that worked for me was one suggested by E-GMAT: Read the passage thoroughly in 4+ mins and then go to questions.

Quant: Overall the course teaches even the most fundamental things, I was already at 49 when I started quant so I kind of skimmed through the course but the way it has been made, it is good to raise quant score from any level. I believe the course fundamentals are explained in as simple ways as possible but the questions are tricky and lengthy. If speed is your problem on quant, E-GMAT can help as it throws super lengthy calculations at you at times. Even the explanations given by E-GMAT usually involved the theoretic approach of solving mathematics. This is a place where I feel E-GMAT Quant can do better. I find it doesn't teach you many smart ways of getting to the solution quickly. 

Scholoranium: This is a great tool and by far the best I have seen so far in GMAT Prep. It gives you insights at so many levels that tracking your progress becomes super easy. It can even tell you what your accuracies are in each subsection such as Modifiers, Verbs etc. This just makes your prep more focussed. At last, the best value add of scholoranium is its explanations of each and every question. Even if you have a doubt you can just raise it to experts and they will answer that in a day. In most of the cases you will find most of your queries have already been answered in the doubts forum as some other student would have already raised it. Takt Time (and my struggles with it) was the most useful metric for me during my whole Prep.

Mentorship from DJ: For me, this was the most valuable part of the course. I was constantly in touch with DJ (E-GMAT's mentorship team member) over emails and I think this was the most valuable addition to my prep  Yes course material and all helps but a guide there to help you charter out your whole path is of worth unexplainable. By the end, I had more than 100 emails in my email conversation with DJ. When to attempt questions, how to analyze a quiz, when to do revisions, when to give and not give mocks, how to track your progress are only a few of the aspects DJ helped me address. I never used to bother about revisions but I think that is one thing DJ used to stress a lot on and it does wonders many people like me did not expect.
 I think at the end of the day you have to back your plan with data and given the sheer amount of data mentors on an E-GMAT team would have, they can clearly tell you what generally works and what doesn't. I always made it a point to validate my plans with DJ and that was very helpful.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","1","0","","","","","",""

He analysed my ECR report and gave me a to-do list. Once I used to complete it, he used to give me the next steps and this is how it progressed.
My earlier score was Q47 and V28. So my major weak point was verbal and thats what he made me target. The SC and CR files are especially helpful. They made the answer analysis almost automatic.
The CR prethinking files help you in understanding how the argument needs to be analysed.
The quant files take you from the basics to the advanced files and help in revision too.
Now, I am coming to the part which helped me the most. The scholaranium. The ability and cementing quizzes give you a correct estimate of your current ability in each topic.And later  one can practice the custom quizzes. The scholaranium mocks give you the most accurate score that you might get in the actual exam with deviation of 10-20 points.

																			by score report","","Instructor","When I was starting my GMAT preparation, I was totally confused about the direction I should take to ensure that I have a decent score. I consulted my friends & family, did heavy research on the internet, watched hundreds of YouTube videos but could not decide on one. Confused, I tried one Paid subscription of one company after another (Jamboree, Experts Global, MGMAT Mocks ) but there was no appreciable increase in my ability. I could feel that while solving questions, I was missing the right approach. 

Then I decided to try out e-GMAT and boy-oh-boy, was I surprised!! The quality of the teaching is definitely much, much better than the rest of the others in the market. And this is coming from someone who has already invested more than Rs.2 Lacs in buying and prepping for the GMAT. 

The best part of e-GMAT is that it relies on reasoning and reasoning alone to solve the questions, much as in real GMAT. Even in Verbal SC (a section that people think is about grammar), e-GMAT showed me how Meaning based approach can help in solving questions faster. In RC & CR, their concept files of Pre Thinking and Process of Elimination helped to quickly gauge and eliminate the wrong options. The Quant section is decent enough to cover all your bases, neither too hard nor too easy. My only complaints were that the IR section is not properly developed and there is no support for AWA.  But overall, the e-GMAT course is still the best in business. I will be recommending it to anyone who is serious to crack the GMAT. 

Finally, the support by the personalized e-GMAT mentor Mr. Archit has been great. He was able to find out the gaps in the armor which would have taken me a long time to figure out. he helped to develop a strategy for every mistake.  

So, for all the upcoming aspirants out there, if you are reading this message - do not do the same mistakes I did. Go for e-GMAT subscription now! It is definitely worth it. You can check out their Free Trial version as well, if you wanna test the waters.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=77#","0","0","","","","","",""
"June 09, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","GMAT 690 - 740","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","Points","Location","I gave my GMAT in July 2019 and scored a 740 (Q49, V41). However, my GMAT journey began much before that. I knew that I was weak in the verbal section (especially SC), and hence when I started my prep, I used a number of book-based resources. As I went through these resources, my confidence that I could tackle the SC questions went up. I absorbed all the concept related information across different SC topics from the modules. After 3-4 months of studies, as I started with my mock exams, my performance was not that great. I would score a 49/50 in quant. However, when it came to verbal, my score was consistently in the 27-35 range. I continued to blindly solve more and more questions thinking that practice would help me achieve my target score, but my verbal score didn’t improve. I had my GMAT scheduled for Jan 2019. I went ahead and gave the GMAT and scored a 690. I immediately cancelled the score.
After this failed attempt, I was not sure how to proceed. I decide to study for a few more months and take the exam again. I continued to use the same materials for studies, until, one of my friends told me about e-GMAT. I had not heard of the company and hence wasn't sure whether it would be helpful. However, after reading a number of reviews on the GMAT Club, and talking to the friend, who was already using it, I decided to go ahead and register for the verbal live course. From the point of view of GMAT preparation, this was one of the best decisions.
As I started the course, I was introduced to the meaning-based approach for SC. When I prepared for the exam earlier, I used to concentrate on the grammatical rules that one would need to know to solve SC questions and thought that meaning was secondary. I do not disagree that grammatical rules are important. But what e-GMAT's meaning based approach made me realize was that meaning is the primary aspect one would need to focus on in order to solve SC questions. e-GMAT brought this meaning aspect, which I had considered secondary, to the forefront. Post that, I slowly started realizing that SC was less about grammar and more about logic. I realized solving a GMAT SC question meant identifying an option that conveys the correct meaning in a most logical and concise manner. Grammar was just a tool to be used to achieve this objective. I continued to diligently follow the meaning-based approach as taught in the modules and actually started enjoying the process of solving SC questions. 
After I finished the concept modules with SC, I moved on to CR. Here I was introduced to the process of pre-thinking. Again, this was something new that I had never heard from the book-based resources. As I went through the course modules, I slowly started realizing the importance on incorporating pre-thinking while solving CR question. Initially it would take some extra time to solve questions as I would have to consciously make an effort to pre-think. But slowly, the idea got ingrained into my process. Pre-thinking actually helped me solve CR question more effectively with greater level of confidence. When I look back and think about it, the idea is very simple but, at the same time, very effective.
Once I was done with learning the concepts, I moved on to Scholaranium. This is e-GMAT’s practice platform where they have put together hundreds of GMAT like questions. The platform offers many capabilities such as custom quizzes, sectional quizzes, ability quizzes. I made extensive use of ability quizzes (which simulate the verbal section) as they helped me understand my standing (in terms of percentile) in the verbal section. It also provided tons of analytics that helped me identify my weak areas so that I could work on them. Additionally, I made extensive use of the forum discussion where e-GMAT experts clarified doubts for almost all the questions that are there on the platform. Scholaranium was the perfect platform for me to put my conceptual learning into practice and improve my verbal ability. 
I saw a dramatic improvement in my verbal ability in my mock exams. I gave my GMAT exam again in July 2019 and scored a 740 (Q49, V41). Whenever my colleagues or friends have asked me for recommendation for a GMAT prep course, I have always recommended e-GMAT without thinking twice. 
e-GMAT also has a very stealth like program that helps students like me build hyper specific plans to create milestone drive study plans. I am working with DJ right now and let us hope I can improve my score to a 750 now! *Fingers crossed* As a student this is all I can ask for and more.

I hope this review is helpful if someone is not sure which prep provider to use.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=78#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

It was then that I decided to enroll to a verbal course to enhance my CR skills and got in touch with DJ from the E-GMAT team. 

DJ encouraged me go through the CR videos and helped me by finalizing a timing strategy. He asked me to maintain an error log. I sent across the error logs frequently and DJ would closely analyze those and suggest remedial measures. The scholarnium 2.0 platform was really helpful in diagnosing weak areas and keeping a check on timing issues. I also learnt a lot from Stacey's guidance on the SC forum in E-GMAT as well.

That is when I cam across e-GMAT and the fact that they are considered to be the best at Verbal. I had a call with Vaibhav from e-GMAT who detailed me about the benefits that the GMAT Online course had to offer. 

The verbal course overall is structured in an amazing way starting all the way from Master Comprehension. The detail with which the Sentence Correction concepts are explained is unparalleled. The Pre-thinking approach in CR just changes the game altogether. Before understanding the approach, I used to have a lot of difficulty, but going through the CR course made it probably my strongest suit in Verbal. As for RC, I always used to have trouble staying concentrated throughout the passage, but the reading strategies helped immeasurably. 

It was not just the quality of the course that was amazing, but the guidance and strategy by DJ were also equally great. He himself used to spend time analyzing my errors and devising a strategy for the future. He even helped outside the course by providing my resources to help me concentrate. Ever since I completed the course once, he helped every step of the way. 

I believe one of the biggest differentiating factors is the new Scholaranium 2.0. The detail down to which it helps you identify weaknesses is incredibly helpful. Another thing that helped me a lot were the strategic review guides. They helped pin-point the type of error I was making and what was the ideal corrective action for that error type.

The accuracy of the Sigma-X mocks was probably another feature that not many other course providers can manage.

																			by score report","","Location","After one month of studying with one of the most traditional programs, I was feeling that my preparation for the GMAT was taking me nowhere. I had taken 3 mocks and my score in the last 2 was flat. In spite of putting in the required hours to study, I felt that I lacked a solid strategy to help me identify and improve my weaknesses. At this point, I came across the E-Gmat platform in Google and decided to give a try to the free materials. I liked them so much, that I immediately scheduled a call with one of the experts and he gave me the confidence that E-Gmat was right for me... And he was absolutely right. Simply put: it was a total game changer, since it gave me a structured plan to follow, constant support as I followed that plan, and the most awesome testing and analytics tools to train and track progress. 

1. The process

The team at E-Gmat has come up with a very structured plan in three stages that really helps you build solid foundations to tackle every single question and then practice, cement your knowledge and improve your ability to answer hard questions. The plan is really easy to follow and you don't have to invent the wheel: they guide you step by step so that you always know what comes next and can track your progress along the way. You just have to put in the hours and a learning attitude and you will certainly improve in every area that is testen in the GMAT.

2. The constant support

The E-Gmat team is very responsive via email. I reached out to them several times during the process and always received an answer within hours. I also loved that the answers they gave me were always customized: they took the time to review my progress on the platform, identify very specific opportunities for improvement and give me a detailed action plan. Most of the time, the answers also included explanatory videos that helped clarify certain things. They really make you feel like you are not alone on the process and they've got you covered. Therefore, the day I actually took the test, I felt confident about my preparation process. I still remember my first conversation with Dhruv and the confidence I felt that my target GMAT score was within my reach. Now that I actually took the test, I am super thankfull to him, DJ, Archit and the rest of the team for making me feel supported during my GMAT prep time. 

3. The tools

One of the most amazing features of E-Gmat is their testing and practice platform called Scholaranium. It is a very structured platform where you can find lots of practice questions of all topics and difficulty level. But they not only give you questions, they give you a tool to build your own custom quizzes according to your needs and then give you comprehensive analytics to evaluate your performance and identify plans for improvement. After each quiz, they help you identify the set of questions that require a strategic review, and they teach you a review technique so that you actually learn from your mistakes and do better next time. Moreover, in Sholaranium you can keep track of your progress over time not only in accuracy but also in timing matters. That way you can easily identify your strengths and weakneses. Additionally, E-Gmat also gives you access to 5 mock tests with very detailed results analysis and step by step explanations for every question. The tests are so realistic that when I took the real GMAT, I felt my score was really predictable, according to what I had seen on the E-Gmat platform. 

All in all, E-Gmat was a really good fit for me and helped me get one step closer to my goal of getting an MBA from a top university. I would totally recommend it to anyone looking to build a solid foundation in Quant and Verbal to take the GMAT full of confidence.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=78#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey back in 2019 and I joined an offline course (deliberately not mentioning the name) however, I did not felt confident at all specially in Verbal section. I tried few mocks and I observed huge variations in scores. I realised this is probably because I did not had any strategy in mind before attempting the exam and in Verbal section I was spending too much time in CR and RC section.

I postponed my plan as I had to travel to UK for work. I came back in 2020 and I decided to start my preparations afresh. I started looking for the best online courses and everywhere I could see just one name ""e-GMAT"". I decided to try it out first using the free trial and I really liked the intuitive yet simple structure of the course. I then decided to subscribe for the GMAT online course and not just Verbal as although my Quant concepts were clear, I did not had a good strategy in mind. I was scoring good 700+ in official mocks and e-GMAT mocks but I got nervous on test day in August 2020 and performed badly scoring a 610. I reached out to e-GMAT team to understand what went wrong and Archit helped me with the strategy for next attempt. He sent a detailed plan on how to use Scholaranium to cement my concepts and improve my accuracy. I also watched many youtube videos to prepare a test strategy and tested it in my mocks.
Today, I feel so happy to take that right decision at the right time as I converted both my dream colleges (IIMA and ISB).

What I found most helpful in the course was:

1)	SC - Meaning based approach is something that can make your life way easier. I was too afraid in the beginning because I never felt confident with grammar rules no matter how much I revised and practiced them. E-gmat taught me that it is okay to not be 100% versed with all the rules (though there is no harm). What you need most for GMAT SC is logic and understand the meaning behind the sentence. With grammar rules you may be able to eliminate 3 out 5 options but the right answer will test you on meaning.

2)	CR – I feel pre-thinking is key to all CR questions in GMAT and this is what e-GMAT CR course was focused on . I really liked how the course does not confuse you with so many types of CR questions that are there in GMAT but instead teaches you basics and organically makes you capable to solve all types of questions with same approach at the end.

3)	RC – The best thing about RC course was writing down a short summary while reading the passage. With enough practice it doesn’t take much time and in fact overall I used to spend just 5 minutes at the end for long passage set.

4)	Quant – I improved my accuracy a lot using Scholaranium. The team provides different target percent that one should achieve in the practice before moving to next practice set. This helped me a lot in cementing my concepts.

I would highly recommend the e-GMAT course to all GMAT aspirants regardless whether you are starting afresh or have some experience with the exam. The course totally changes your perspective towards the exam. Also, the team is highly responsive I used to get all my doubts clear in the portal almost the same day itself. If you are facing any other challenges (apart from concepts/problems) even then you can reach out to the team and I am sure they will have some solution.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=78#","0","0","","","","","",""

After reading many positive reviews of e-gmat and going through free modules on e-gmat, I scheduled zoom call with team and got all my queries answered. Satisfied with every aspect of e-gmat, I decided to enroll for E-gmat online. I completely trusted the course and scored a 700 :D.
E-gmat provides a very comprehensive and well-structured and cover most of the basics. The concept files have pre quiz, concept and a post quiz. This structured approach helps to understand if we have really grasped both the theory and application of concept. I would like to specially highlight their methodologies for the verbal sections. Pre-thinking in CR questions, Breaking Down of sentences in Sentence Correction Questions and reading strategies in RC helped me in improving my Verbal score significantly. Quant course of e-gmat helped in brushing up my concepts and provided a structured approach in solving DS questions.
Scholaranium 2.0 provides a vast variety of questions and great analytics. It gives us the flexibility to create custom quizzes to test and build concepts. Solutions provided are informative and helped me bridging knowledge gaps.
Sigma-X mocks available with course helped me constantly gauge my progress and gave accurate prediction of my score.

LMT Program by e-gmat really provided the most required final push towards my GMAT. Thanks to Dhananjay. He provided me an in depth analysis of my mocks and pointed out gaps.  Day wise strategic study plan devised by him helped me in addressing my weak areas. :)

"May 31, 2021","Joined:","Posts:","Kudos:","Verified GMAT Classic score:","Thanks to DJ and e-GMAT for being part of my GMAT Prep Journey","REVIEWER IDENTITY VERIFIED 

																			by score report","","Instructor","Someone once said in a video with Rajat, “GMAT is the first exam you study for yourself”. It resonated with me, because you are right this was in deed was the first time I have wanted something for myself; not for mom, not for dad, not for anyone else but me.

Helping me in this journey, as my coach and mentor has been e-gmat and especially DJ. I continue to be baffled at the quantity and quality of help. The mentorship, analytics and a treasure trove of top quality practice questions that helped me along the way has been huge. I know just how grateful I am for their help, because e-gmat was not the first course I turned to for help. I enrolled in 3 other ""prestigious"" institutions, but, felt very alone and very lost in my prep. And, thanks to DJ, I got my sense of direction, a unique strategy tailor made for me, and a personalized coach invested in my success. With all the guidance & motivation I received over the course of several months, I scored 710 (Q50, V36) in my first official attempt. With that, I personally felt like I let DJ down. That’s how involved he has been throughout this journey for me! And now, as I prepare for my 2nd attempt, all that is in my mind is to make him proud. Can you believe it? Imagine if Virat Kohli or Sachin Tendulkar came to coach you for cricket.. that's how I feel about DJ. He helped me with a plan when to schedule my re-take exam, and made a complete plan for me. I never felt like I was alone on groping in the dark or alone at any point during this journey.

Have you used Nike Run Club app? If you have a marathon in say, 2 months, it will tailor make a training schedule for you on when to do the runs and when to rest. Just like that, DJ gave me a personalized training path, keeping in mind the D-date, and when to re-take the test. It helped tremendously, because you don’t get too many shots at this. Unlike a marathon which you can participate year after year, you only get 7 shots at this life changing exam. With DJ as my coach, I literally feel I have everything I need to go after my target score. I never once felt like I was shooting in the dark. I just hope that I don’t let him down in my next attempt. Right after my 1st attempt, I came back home completely blanked out. I sent him an email. And within a couple of hours, I had a promise from him that he will help me plan my next few days before my 2nd attempt. And as soon as he saw my ESR, within a couple of hours, I had an email from him detailing exactly where I went wrong and how we will try to correct the areas where I lack.

Coupled with DJ, e-gmat also offers an amazing analytics dashboard called Scholaranium 2.0. Believe me, you won’t find a better valuable trove of information anywhere else (not any of the other ""prestigious"" prep schools!) It’s like your personal JARVIS telling you how well you have fared in each test, with a perfect tool to drill down topic wise and find out your weak zones, and improve them. It tells you everything - how long you took for each question, and it puts that stat in comparison with the mean time to solve that question. Deriving meaningful insight from this, it helped me figure out exactly where I was going wrong and focus on how I needed to improve - this is so valuable to have. It helped me improve my accuracy, and focus on concepts I needed to master. I bought into e-gmat's philosophy when it comes to solving SC questions based on meaning based approach and no shortcuts. e-gmat's SC course is truly phenomenal. Their strategy for RC's, ""pauses"", was a game changer for me - it helped me comprehend passages faster than I used to and become more efficient. Without their quant material, I wouldn't have been confident to score Q50. With its incredibly detailed stats, I was able to plan and prioritize my preparation really well. Also, the fact that you take a concept assessment quiz right after learning a concept ensures that you have grasped everything there is to be learnt from the concept. I doubt there are many GMAT prep companies out there that have this methodology of teaching. 

Many of the questions even have video answers (thanks!), which is really great. You get to listen to the thought process of the teacher, and how the right answer was arrived at. And I must mention, Rajat's other motivational videos are impressive. You get to hear all about your fellow student's experiences and triumphs. You never feel alone in this journey with e-gmat. The sheer quality of explanations and the level of data insights you get from the new platform is breathtaking. It’s all available to you as you aim for your top score.

My only wish list for e-gmat is for them to have more mocks. At 5, I am left wanting more (so that I wouldn’t have to spend extra money trying to buy more for 2nd attempt). Other than that, I feel it’s a package that can help with your success, just as it has for me so far. Personally, I feel that e-gmat is charging much less than the value it is providing to people who want to work with its team. Looking back, I don’t mind paying more than I did. They are worth each penny (and more) that they are charging.

Invest in them, they will invest in you. Good luck for your GMAT journey. Mine isn’t done just yet.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=78#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I had already written 3 attempts of GMAT before I enrolled in e-GMAT with my highest score was 640. After about 2 months of preparation geared mostly towards verbal, and 2 Sigma mock tests with an average score of 680, I booked a date for my 4th attempt. I chose to go to a test center to write the test since I was skeptical of consistent electricity supply at my place but the test at the center this time felt really tough, especially Quant. The difficulty level seemed higher even in Verbal. Sentence correction was my strongest part but I remember the first question was an SC question which took me about 4 minutes to answer. It didn't take me long to realize that the score this time will not be very different than the previous times, and I was right. Yet again, I scored a 640. This time my Quant score had reduced by 3 points to Q44 and my Verbal score had increased by 3 points to V34. It was shattering. I remember coming out of the test center completely dejected. I thought of giving up again very seriously as I felt I had given everything I had to the test. My performance in the 4th attempt was just marginally better than my performance in the first attempt. But after getting hope from my mother and gathering myself a bit, I decided to write the test again. I gave a Sigma mock test and scored only a 630 (Q46 V30). But I was genuinely unable to concentrate during that test so I knew that I could have done better than that. After a few days of more preparation, I wrote my last Sigma Mock and scored a 730 (Q47 V42). I was happy with my verbal score but I knew the score was a little inflated as I had guessed a lot of the Quant questions that miraculously turned out to be correct. With so much variation in scores, I was unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so I wrote to e-GMAT asking for guidance.

The next day I got reached out by Archit, an e-GMAT mentor, who was willing to provide me mentorship. I readily accepted the offer and we began the very next day. Archit looked at my performance history in Scholaranium and even though my accuracy was respectable in medium and hard-level questions in verbal, he still found loopholes to improve. He also pointed out that I just had not practiced enough in Quant and laid out a plan to adequately practice quant. This was very convenient as I was able to have a focused approach. I knew exactly what I had to do each day and there was no time wasted in figuring out daily goals. I diligently followed what Archit asked of me but time was running out for me. I wanted to apply to LBS MIM, the deadline for which was just 2 days far. So Archit considering such a peculiar situation gave me fruitful advice and laid out a plan for the last day before the test, to have the best attempt. He also sensed me undertaking pressure and talked calmly on the phone which in turn relaxed me. I followed his advice and wrote the test, this time online due to lockdown. The test felt easy this time but my test was lagging and I was unable to register my answer on the last question in the Quant section even though there were about 10 seconds left. This made me really worried as I thought I'd be penalized severely. Although during the 8-minute break, I tried to calm myself as much as I could to be laser-focused in the verbal section. The verbal section went pretty smoothly but I had to guess about 3 questions of an RC at the end due to time constraints and the fear of the test lagging again. But soon I saw the score and it said 680 (Q47 V36 IR 5). I was elated. I had definitely performed better in mocks but in an official test, this was my best performance, considering I could not answer the last Quant question and had to guess the three RC questions at the end of the verbal section. Plus 680 was the average score for the LBS MIM program and I had met it just 2 days before the application deadline. I immediately called Archit after the test and thanked him. 

But it doesn't end here. Archit stayed in touch even after the test to help me figure out a way to secure the test report which was required in the application process. This was very encouraging and highly unexpected.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=78#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I have never seen an educational service as good as E-GMAT. It is a one stop solution for cracking the GMAT. Their process-oriented approach makes results just a simple by-product rather than the goal.
I had purchased the two-month pack for both, verbal and quant, which came with 3-month access to GMAT Club and 5 mocks of 800 Score and Sigma X. I was studying full-time for the GMAT and this one purchase gave me so much resource that I could practice each and every type of question at various difficulties.

Coming to the Course Content:
•	Starting with the SC Module, the meaning-based approach makes the process of elimination faster and more accurate. The course will gradually build up your ability to dissect each and every word of the sentence and to figure out the role it plays.
•	The CR and RC course will teach the critical step of pre-thinking which with time will help you find out what the correct option may contain even before you read the options
Scholaranium 2.0:
The testing software of E-GMAT, Scholaranium 2.0, is way too insightful. It wont just give you your result, but also a complete analysis of the weak areas, timing, corrective actions and plan to target. I found myself referring to this data very frequently to check if I am on the right track and course correct when needed.

Sigma X Mock:
These mocks are a very close representation of your actual score. The question quality is also very reliable and the analytics provided are extremely useful to figure out an optimum test taking strategy.

LMT:
If you get into the mentorship program, there is an extremely high probability that you will see a score starting with 7.
I was assigned the mentor Aditee Biyanee, who was an excellent mentor and regularly helped me with every minute detail right from test taking strategies to timing exercises. Gradually, my GMAT journey became even more enjoyable and I could sense a sharp improvement in my abilities and confidence. All thanks to Aditee!

Overall, I feel that this purchase was worth every penny spent.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=79#","0","0","","","","","",""

I had a strong grip on Quant (>48 on initial exploratory mocks) but Verbal was where I needed skill development. Thanks to my peers, Mehak, I was led in the right direction to enroll in the E-GMAT online course. Counseling by Karan Kantharia was immensely helpful which helped me identify my gaps.

The Verbal course is brilliant; it helps you build your skill step-by-step based on logic, rules, and methodologies. I assure you, you can solve any question of SC, CR, or RC with the application of the methodology in the course. For me, the verbal methodology (especially CR; which many find difficult) of the E-GMATs course is the MVP.
Sectional Ability quizzes are a must to develop the ability and before attempting the SigmaX mocks.
SIGMA-X mocks are of the highest quality ( tough as well :P) and they are the closest to the actual exam.
Thanks to Aditee Biyani (LMT program) who helped me in my final weeks of exams after I had completed the course and all my other mocks.

																			by score report","Points","Location","eGMAT truly stands out amongst all the GMAT test prep platforms. I’ve spent countless days across multiple prep platforms, including 6 months completing the full course at one. I had followed every guideline that they laid out and yet, I was unable to get close to my desired score or simply make any progress. Till then, I had been hesitant to go with eGMAT due to their video format, but I finally took an eGMAT subscription after exhausting all other options. I could immediately tell the difference, and haven’t looked elsewhere since. I realised that while the other big name companies are content with preparing you for a 700 score, eGMAT is the only one that can prepare you for 740+ and push you to get there. For example, I consistently got a Q51 across all mock tests on every other platform, yet my quant score in the actual GMAT was stuck at Q49, Q50. Funnily, eGMAT’s Sigma-X Mock was the only one where I had scored a Q49.

The folks at eGMAT really put in a lot of effort to be the best in the industry. Alongside their self-paced course, they’ve instituted a “Last Mile Program” to handhold students on strategy and other aspects of the preparation through one-on-one mentorship. I got to be a part of the program and was lucky to have Dhananjay (or DJ) personally guiding me. He made it super simple for me to go through the course and selectively work on the competencies that I needed. I started out with a tailored study plan with set milestones, making modifications along the way based on my progress and time availability. Amazingly, my ability in CR and RC started improving in a matter of days, despite not having moved at all in months. It gave me the confidence that I could really get to my higher target and I want to thank Dhananjay and eGMAT for that. I was however running a bit short on time and took the exam before I could complete the planned modules. I scored a 720 (Q51, V36), owing to not working on my Verbal timing. It fell short of my target score but did give me more clarity on my next steps. I’m continuing to work with Dhananjay to address the gaps and move towards a higher score in my next attempt.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=79#","2","0","","","","","",""

Not only did it give direction to my preparation but also the mentorship and the course as a whole made this endeavour worthwhile.
The following course features helped me during my GMAT Journey :
1. The Course Structure : The course has been aptly divided into various concept files followed by the application files and practice files. This structure helps in breaking down a subtopic into manageable pieces for any test taker. 

2. Solving The SC & CR Conundrum :  The two sub topics most of the test takers dread are SC and CR . 
E-GMAT helps in resolving these with utmost efficiency using the Meaning Based approach for SC and Pre Thinking approach for CR .

3. The LMT Program : In my opinion this was the highlight of the course and this is what makes it the most comprehensive course available.
One of the best strategists at e-Gmat , Dhananjay helped me identify and target my week areas. This hyperspecific targetting helped break the 700 barrier in no time.

4. The Scholaranium & Sigma X Mocks  : This feature is the X factor , that E-gmat has. This tool is behind the pin point detection of weak areas and if there are any issues with your strategy. The 5 Sigma X mock tests, each of them having its own question pool, are more than enough to evaluate and if required to navigate one's preparation.

I started with a score of 590 and the above features of the course and the right mentorship helped me cross the 700 barrier in my first GMAT attempt.

																			by score report","","Location","I came across E-Gmat on YouTube when I was looking for a specific GMAT topic. I somehow landed on their website and it was the best thing that happened to me in the entire 2020. 

I had an introduction session with one of their team members. He very politely told me that they way I was studying for my GMAT was not correct. You see, I was studying to learn, not to score. It's the worst strategy for any competitive exam. I knew absolutely everything in the course but could not translate that to a decent score. 

I purchased their GMAT Online package. Their course is so well designed that it almost programs you to do well. It is self-paced and it tests you on the smallest concepts before you proceed. You learn in a way that your scores become ironclad. Say you are getting a 700 in their mock tests, there is absolutely no way you would get any lower on your final exam without a solid reason. 

It works well for someone with a weak quant/verbal ability as well as someone with a strong ability.

Another brilliant aspect of their course is that it creates a dashboard for you that can tell you EXACTLY what your problem areas are. For example, it doesn't just tell you that your sentence correction is a problems. It will tell you that you are weak in a very specific type of modifier questions. It is a very scientific approach to studying. Honestly, it has changed the way I approach many other aspects of my life. 

Let me try to sum up in a few points:

Pros:
1. Very structured approach to the course
2. Minutely detailed dashboard that helps you pinpoint your problem areas to a tee.
3. Very prompt team in case you need extra help or guidance or just moral support
4. Large question bank across all topics.
5. Both, verbal and quant, sections are robust. 


Cons:
Honestly, none. I did struggle with their platform in the beginning because it's extensive. I wrote to them and got an explanation in less than 30 mins. 

Who is it for?

-Anyone looking to take the GMAT without wasting any time. There is a lot of material out there and I have tried it all. My advice, just take this course and that's all you need. A very unpopular but gold advice - you do not even need the The Official Guide for GMAT.

																			by score report","Points","Location","e-GMAT's Quant program is great for people with no Maths background!

In my current job, I only use basic maths and I rely heavily on Excel. As a result, I knew that I had a long way to go in Quant after seeing just a few practice GMAT questions. I did heavy research online and found that e-GMAT had many great reviews in both Quant and Verbal, so I signed up!

After starting the Quant section, my belief that I have a long way to go in Quant was confirmed. e-GMAT's lessons are well structured, with videos and clear explanations. However, at first I found there to be a giant leap between the concept files and the practice questions (the practice questions got hard for me, really quickly!). e-GMAT's Quant questions are actually tougher than the actuals GMAT's Quant questions, but this is great preparation and people who are serious about getting a high score should embrace this.

e-GMAT then rolled out Quant 2.0, which is a substantial upgrade over the original Quant files. Quant 2.0 takes more time to assess your current skill level, before then recommending next steps. If your baseline knowledge is low, Quant 2.0 does a great job of slowly teaching the concepts from a foundational level. My Quant reached another level after completing some Quant 2.0 materials. However, due to the time crunch before my GMAT date, I only used Quant 2.0 for Number Properties and going into the exam, I knew that I still had some work to do on Algebra and Geometry.

When it comes to Verbal, I made the mistake of believing that a native English speaker like myself will fly through the Verbal section. Hence, I put a heavier emphasis on Quant and my GMAT score clearly displays this.

Moving forward to the exam day, I decided to take the exam anyway despite my gaps in Algebra, Geometry, Verbal and mental stamina. I wanted to get the first crack out the way and experience the exam pressure first-hand. I completed the GMAT Online on Monday 4th January 2021. My overall score was 670 (Q49, V32, IR6), which is significantly lower than my target score. On the bright side though - I achieved a Q49 by doing Quant 1.0 and only Number Properties in Quant 2.0, so I still have plenty of new, useful content to work through as I prepare for my retake.

Looking ahead, as I am not happy with 670 and I know that I can achieve a higher score with the right preparation, I now look forward to completing the rest of Quant 2.0 and digging deep into Verbal, before retaking the GMAT on 4th March, 2021. I strongly believe that by completing Quant 2.0 in Algebra and Geometry and by completing the robust Verbal program, I will achieve Q50+, V40+ and my target score.

What is even greater about e-GMAT is their commitment to their students' success. e-GMAT are now helping me craft a study plan to help me achieve my target score, which is outstanding support in my opinion.

I will be back to update this amazing community again after my GMAT retake :)

EDIT AFTER RETAKE - 12/MAY/2021

I started my GMAT journey in July 2020 with quant capabilities in desperate need of development. After a couple months of frustrations, I started e-GMAT in September 2020.

By the time December  rolled around, my Quant still was not up to par. However, my online exam was booked for 4th January and I felt that instead of postponing, I should get sit the exam anyway just to get the first shot out the way and make myself feel comfortable moving forward. Whilst doing some last-minute revision, I noticed that e-GMAT had upgraded their Quant course, Quant 2.0. I completed part of the new Number Properties and realised how much of a massive upgrade Quant 2.0 was over Quant 1.0, so I emailed e-GMAT with some positive feedback and a few questions. e-GMAT then offered to put me through their mentorship program, with Archit as my mentor.

I ended up taking the GMAT three times – the first two online and the last one in the test centre. Archit helped me from just before exam #1 all the way to exam #3, and I cannot begin to explain how valuable his guidance and support was. My exam results were:

1.	4th January 2021: 670 (Q49, V32) - Online
2.	4th March 2021: 690 (Q47, V38) - Online
3.	7th May 2021: 740 (Q48, V44) – Test Centre

With the ESR not available after the first attempts, Archit and I had a couple debriefs then he would recommend next steps. Archit would also check in from time-to-time to see how everything is going. Archit not only held me accountable, but also took the time to analyse my quiz and mock results to recommend the best possible next steps.

Overall, I strongly believe it would have taken me much longer to score 740 if I had not worked with Archit from January. A big thank you from me, and a strong recommendation for all reading this to consider e-GMAT and their mentorship program!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=79#","25","5","","","","","",""

I give a 10/10  for improving the fundamental skills ,the first aspect,especially your verbal . And as most of them already know e-gmat follows a step-by-step process, there is not much i could add up to its value which has proven the test of time.And regarding Quant i dint much stress on my preparation, may be i should've , thats what is reflected in my gmat Quant :47. By the way , I got a score of 680 (V35,Q47) , I dont want to stress much on how i got here or the score , becuase i want to emphasise more on the improvement you can make through the course. So no complaints so far with material , scholaranium and approach.

On the second point i have some reservations the stategy , the plan . This is the most underrated thing in GMAT , As when i started the prep i thought i could win with brute force skill. I Wouldnt recommend that. In this particular aspect , may be e-gmat could provide some help. And the mock gmat scores might represent the actual score.they have tendency to show high score. Having said that , may its too much to ask of it since the strategy needs are dynamic from person to person.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","0","1","","","","","",""

As I have mentioned that this course will give you all the topics and the theory related to them, but It is not the only thing which you will need in your preparation, I mean you will need help from couple of other sources specially for practice. 

I really liked the Critical Reasoning part. I will say with respect to CR its pretty much a bible/Geeta. 

Overall, its a very good course specially verbal section.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","My first attempt at GMAT was with an unstructured on and off prep using the manhattan guides and a marathon of randomly solving questions on gmatprep, which ultimately yielded a score of V28. For my next attempt, my biggest takeaway was that I needed a structured course provider to add some method to this madnesss. I started prepping first for Quant with one of the other test prep companies, but their verbal course was not striking a chord with me. So, I started looking for other test prep companies specializing in their verbal course offerings and came across e-gmat on gmatclub. I saw their reviews on gmatclub and as some folks might experience, I was immediately skeptical by seeing the sheer number of positive reviews. “How can a company have such a fanfare?? there is definitely a lot of marketing going on here”, was my thinking. I thought that all the reviewers were being compensated in some way. Now that I'm writing my own review, I feel so silly of having such thoughts earlier.

I had tried to find other alternatives, but none seemed to match the e-gmat question explanations and their content available freely on gmatclub and youtube. Watching the webinars hosted by Rajat over youtube, I kept thinking that these guys definitely have broken down the GMAT prep to a science, so I convinced myself to sign up for their free trial and have an experience. Although the free trial gives access only to a few chapters, the following quickly became apparent to me:

1. Most of their content is in video format – I used to hate video lessons due to the time commitment. But considering that most of us are visual learners, the video format actually turned out to be very helpful for me as I could quickly recollect a lot of the animations and illustrations while trying to recall concepts.
2. There are a lot of chapters – This meant that they have broken done the entire GMAT content to various subject areas, down to bite-sized lessons. This also meant that I could be flexible with my daily study commitments.
3. Content is extremely simplified – A wide audience ranging from native speakers to folks having English as their tertiary language can follow-along and learn effectively.

During the free trial, I noted all my concerns and sent an email to the e-gmat support team asking for a consultation meeting. Sundeep reached out to me and was very kind to address all my concerns. I then took a lap of faith and signed up for their ‘Verbal Online’ course.

For my experience through the course, I will summarize my thoughts based on each of the content areas and the e-gmat value offerings.
1. Induction – The lessons here are frankly under-rated. Apart from introducing the subtleties of the GMAT, there are some extremely important concepts introduced here, such as the ‘Takt Time’. This concept had a major influence on my skipping strategy for test-day.
2. Master Comprehension – This is the first section in the Verbal area of the course and is supposed to be taken prior to any of the SC, CR or RC sections. This section addresses a pain-point for majority of non-native test-takers, the ability to quickly and accurately comprehend written content. The strategies focus on how to breakdown any passage or sentences in order to fully grasp the intended meaning and information.
3. SC Section – Truly their strength. This section represents the most unfamiliar content for non-natives, but the e-gmat team have done a remarkable job of breaking down the subject area to a level that is extremely easy to grasp, remember and apply.
4. CR Section – They advocate the process of ‘Pre-Thinking’ for approaching all CR questions. This concept was totally new to me and frankly didn’t work for me in the beginning. But as you follow-along with the CR chapters and consciously apply the pre-thinking approach, it starts to become a sub-conscious activity. This approach definitely requires faith, but does pay huge dividends.
5. RC Section – Content is fairly simple and well-organized, the lessons are geared towards acclimating the students to the question types, common error types, and the strategic reading process to effectively comprehend the information within a short time.
6. IR Section – Lessons provide a good introduction to the 4 question types and highlight an effective way to approach each question type.
7. Support (Subject Areas) – Each of the lessons has a forum section included in the same page where a lot of previous students have posted queries and the e-gmat experts have answered them. A lot of the doubts during my study were already found to have been addressed here.
8. Sholaranium (Tests) – It is their platform for generating various types of practice quizzes. The options for selecting the specific types of questions allowed me to perform targeted practice of my weak sections. For anyone starting to use this tool, I need to point out that all quiz types use a common questions pool, so I would recommend planning the quizzes in order to avoid exhausting the number of available questions. The quality of questions is very identical to what I experienced in the official tests.
9. Sholaranium (Insights) – Apart from the practice tests, the performance is used to generate valuable data analytics. As a matter of fact, the areas identified by scholaranium as my weaknesses were a bit unexpected, but the insights turned out to be accurate when I reviewed my performance across the official practice tests. I used this data to plan my skipping strategy, quickly guessing on question types that I was most likely to answer incorrectly. 
10. Discounted Official Practice Tests – Official mba.com practice tests can be purchased at a discounted price via e-gmat. Another value offering of subscribing to an e-gmat course. 
11. Support  (Testing Strategies) – Another under-rated offering of e-gmat. Once I had completed all the subject areas, I noted that I had become very good at answering the questions correctly in practice tests, but under timed test-taking conditions my accuracy was being severely impacted. My performance in the official practice tests was also varying from V35 – V41 for the same reason. So, I reached out to the e-gmat support team for some guidance and DJ responded and offered his mentorship to help me maximize my performance. DJ and other members of the strategy team have done a remarkable job of mentoring a lot of students,  a bunch of success stories can be found on the e-gmat youtube channel that highlight the impact of the strategy team.
12. Sigma-X Mocks – DJ from the e-gmat strategy team had me attempt the first Sigma-X mock and analyzed my performance to point out some insights that pretty much were replicated in the official GMAT ESR. Although I cannot vouch for the sigma-x test algorithm or the questions pool (since no test company can accurately replicate the algorithm or the official questions), for me the biggest value was in the insights. Although DJ had analyzed the insights and pointed out my gaps, I couldn't change my testing behavior much as my official test was just days after this mock, so the gaps from my mock pretty much repeated in the official test. The key takeaway was that the Sigma-X mocks can reliably be used to identify gaps in test-taking behavior that can make or break your score on test-day, and it would be much wiser to leverage this feature ahead of your test day.

As I write this review/debrief, I am working on the insights and gaps pointed out by DJ and am preparing to give another attempt in order to further boost my score. 

During my GMAT prep, whenever I was going through a phase of self-doubt I used to read the reviews on gmatclub and watch the debriefs on e-gmat youtube channel, which served as a constant source of motivation and boosted my spirit thinking that if they can achieve it, so can I. 

Closing out, I want to give a huge shout out to the entire e-gmat team for not just making a great product, but also for actively working hard to support their students through thick and thin of their GMAT journey.

I hope that my progress from a V28 to a V40 provides you with a similar experience and instills a belief in your ability to achieve the score that you desire, and that me delving into such depth of my GMAT journey persuades you to make a quality decision of trusting the e-gmat team as a reliable partner in your endeavor. Know that there is a big team of subject-matter experts, strategy-experts, etc. who are dedicated to this subject and are completely vested in your success. 

Wishing you all the best in your prep, good luck.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I was lucky enough to be recommended e-gmat right when I was starting my GMAT preparation by a friend who had scored a 730 through them. So, I did not waste any time or energy exploring any other service providers and went ahead with the e-gmat complete test preparation package, and I don’t regret this decision.

I love the way the modules are structured on the portal. Both the Verbal & the Quant sections have sufficient chapters / sub-sections built in to ensure that a student is thoroughly taught about the necessary concepts. After each section follows a practice test which further solidifies one's understanding of the concept. All these modules are visually very attractive and interactive as well - use of charts, arrows and colors really do help to clearly understand the topics being discussed, highlight errors that sample questions have, and bring it all together with suggested corrective processes.

The main highlight of the e-gmat subscription is their Scholaranium, which contains sections for both Verbal & Quant questions built by the e-gmat team, as well as a repository of Official GMAT questions available for practice. The Scholaranium gives you valuable insights about your performance - on average time taken to solve questions, sectional accuracy, topic-wise accuracy, performance graphs over a shorter period of time, etc. When you properly analyze these insights in tandem with your performance in these practice tests or performance in the sectional modules, you are able to draw very clear inferences about your weaknesses and areas requiring improvement.

SigmaX Mock tests are available on the portal, which further help the student acclimatize to the official test environment. The questions you solve in these mock tests are very closely representative of the type of questions that are thrown at you in the official GMAT test. Just like the scholaranium, the SigmaX module also provides you with sufficient insights about your performance in these tests and areas one needs to revisit or improve in.

Lastly, I would like to talk about my experience interacting with the e-gmat team. If you have any doubts arising across the length of your preparation, the e-gmat team has provided multiple points of contact across the module to reach out to them, and the response is very prompt – generally within a day. Moreover, when I reached out to the e-gmat team requesting an analysis of my official test performance, they were happy to deep-dive into the ESR, chalk out areas that I need to focus on and also build a customized study plan with targets. I worked very closely with Dhananjay from e-gmat who was very kind to make a video analysis about my 690 score on the official test. Dhananjay was the first individual who made me realize that I had a problem of “letting go” during the official test. He also laid out topics I need to revisit from the preparation modules, suggested weekly targets and also helped design the practice tests that I need to be taking, to further improve my test taking performance. 

The net result is that I scored a 710 and I could not be more grateful to the entire team of e-gmat for helping me navigate through every step of the way for a 700+ score. 

I hope my review helps prospective candidates in their decision-making process for GMAT Preparation. I also wish team e-gmat the very best for the road ahead!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Hi everyone!!

So I had written my first GMAT and scored a 640 (V35 Q42) The real shocker for me was my verbal score. In my GMAT prep official mocks I had scored upto 690 and had gotten verbal marks in the range of V35 to V40. 
Post the exam, I knew I had to try again. I was genuinely confused about how to proceed as I had already exhausted most of my resources - OG guide 2021, Quant guide 2021, Verbal guide 2021, Kaplan 800, Barrons. 
That is when I kept seeing reviews of E gmat verbal score improvement all over GMAT club and decided to buy the course. 
Cut to 2nd attempt.  I have scored a 700 (V40 Q47) and the credit for ensuring that V40 definitely goes to E-Gmat.
Ask anyone who performs well in Verbal it comes down to developing your gut by having the right methodology and knowing the rules.
E-Gmat helped me internalise a flow chart on how to approach different types of problems.
CR - pre thinking method helps you by ensuring that you have absolutely understood the question and are picking an answer you have already thought about than go blindly looking in the answer choices.
SC - their comprehensive set of rules and explanation videos help you identify the flaws and when left with maybe the last 2 choices, you employ the meaning based approach to finalize the aNswer.

The quant improvement was thanks to GMAT club tests. 

If you are looking to improve your Verbal score,I genuinely recommend E-Gmat. It helps solidify a structure kn your head that ultimately after enough practice turns into your gut!

																			by membership","Points","Location","I had first considered attempting GMAT in 2019, just a year into my new job. I set a date 4 months in advance, thinking I would have ample time to devote to my preparation. A couple of hectic projects and several early mornings and late nights at the office, I realised I had just over a month to go to appear for the test. I also took measure of my practice performance and saw that I was nowhere close to achieving a satisfactory score. That is when I started frantically looking for prep courses to guide me in my preparation.

After attending various free seminars and watching tutorials of prep companies on youtube, I decided that e-gmat was the best fit available to me. They offered a unique feature of one-to-one mentorship to help students stay on the right track. A conversation with Karan Kantharia, who analysed my mock test in great detail and provided valuable insights, confirmed my belief in e-gmat.

As I signed up for the course, I received regular emails from my mentor Ashutosh. He mentored me on the kinds of questions I needed to practice given my ability at the time and the resources I needed to peruse to fill in the conceptual gaps. This is the greatest advantage of the course in my opinion. Any course has a large volume of resources and question banks both and picking the resources and questions needed for one's individual ability is crucial, when one is faced with severe time constraints. 

I was recommended to attempt the Master Comprehension and RC modules since my mock test had revealed gaps in that area. Master Comprehension is an answer to prayer when it comes to reading long complex sentences. I would recommend this module not only to GMAT test takers but to anyone who wants to improve their ability to really understand the nuances of complex sentences. In addition to this, the question bank Scholoranium helps in keeping track of one's performance in various sections and sub-sections and keeps one motivated to get better at solving questions correctly and speedily.

After one month of juggling work and prep, I appeared for the test and got a 680. I was not satisfied with the score and attempted the GMAT again this year (January 2021) using the notes I had made when my course was active. In this attempt, I scored a 710. I credit e-gmat with building all the basics essential to get a 700+ score on the test. 

To conclude, if anyone has lost direction with respect to their prep or is looking to build a strong foundation of GMAT concepts, this course is the first step in the right direction.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Amazing to have you here. If you are reading, we are probably sharing a love for cracking the GMAT. Trust me the process is worth it. I want to share with you a little about my story and hope this adds value to your preparation. Let’s start with some context.

I always knew I wanted to study an MBA. My mind is trained to think about businesses and my heart has always been towards seeing business as tool towards positive change. 

I knew it as I studied my bachelors in mechanical engineering, that I will be doing the MBA route down the line. I did my masters in powertrain engineering in France because I am passionate about how mobility sector has been revolutionizing and impacting every other industry. I got involved into the tech sector and a product developer and it was not long before I could see the difference between my thought process and the 100 engineers in our group. Business viability to the future, its positioning and impact mattered to me. As I got busy learning about cultures, languages moving continuously across borders I realized the craving to expose myself to like minded people. I wanted to be among peers discussing the next big entrepreneurship idea and I chose to move to city that would give opportunity to head along the process. 

This the beginning of my GMAT journey. Though I had played around with the GMAT idea back in 2018 it was December 2019  when I finally decided to go in for the exam. Little did I know it was going to be a year and a half before I would be prepared to take the exam. I started of my preparation doing some market research and getting in all the recommended books (GMAT Prep, Manhatten Prep). The Manhatten Prep guides were a joy and would recommend you to definitely read the Roadmap, because that prepares you mentally about GMAT. However till summer I was heading nowhere. 

My first GMAT Preparation test I got a 670.  I had tried to go through the Manhatten book and I was definitely not feeling confident about the verbal section. I made a decision at this point to go all in for the Exam and that was the mantra that carried me all along. I loved the interface, the explanation that experts global provided and I took several tests in the platform, focusing more on my test taking strategies and timing and I was plateauing in the 700 zone. I was there far too long and I was clueless how to go forward. Keen to go up, I persisted to look for solution and it was such a blessing that I found eGMAT. Initially I had planned to take my GMAT in a couple of week from the point I took the eGMAT course. I resonated so much with the approach I decided to postpone my exam and only focus on re inventing and building myself. I attended the webinars, watched their debriefs, went though the course structure, and just looking at their approach I had complete trust in the eGMAT process.

This debrief Is about eGMAT and why I think this is going to add value to your preparation. It was a huge value to me and I want to ensure that you can take value from this. 

So what does eGMAT do that it gave me the right pedestal. Here are my 5 point synopsis based on the value I took from eGMAT.

1.	Clearly SC: I will start with SC because that was the main reason why I signed up for eGMAT. I had no clue how, Why answers were wrong and WHY answers were right, I hated the approach to memorize and eliminate based on rules. And when I found about eGAMT meaning based approached I could so relate this to my own necessity to understand. I just gave me a lot of joy to finally understand. It gave me an appreciation for the test makers designing the exam. I started to love the SC problems. eGMATs approach Is systematic, clear, elaborate and through. You do have to trust the process and invest the time but the impeccable support from Rajat, Payal and team have that sorted having the approach customized for every single user who reaches out to the service team.

Hats off to the eGMAT team for pulling off such an excellent SC course. I would recommend you to do it just for fun, it will improve your appreciation for language. 


2.	Counter intuitively RC: When I started with eGMAT my RC was mediocre and I knew that to get a decent score that I needed to weed out why I was going wrong. Where was I making the mistake. The eGMATs Master comprehension course and clear structuring of the questions gave me a perspective that I missed out in my previous preparation. With the complete emphasis on understanding the meaning, I knew realized the key aress for me to improve on my RC was actually very counter intuitive. Not to worry about the timing as I read the passage. This is so hard to ingrain and trust this process but actually reading the passage thoroughly made me faster in completing the RC section with higher accuracy. I need to give huge credits to eGMAT to support me in driving this into me a habit. I picked this up from the eGMAT course and it has become a life skill. 

3.	Critically CR: I had always maintained CR to be one of my strong areas. Coming from a physics and engineering background I love CR. I enjoy this and have been so proud to answer CR questions. My own failures in the CR part of verbal I had related it to the lack of timing.  

So it was a huge surprise for me when DJ from the e GMAT team reached to me and asked me to focus on CR because that was turning to be my weak area. While the data was telling me that my own conformity bias was not allowing me to see the real picture. I owe DJ a lot to ask me to go through the CR course completely. The pre thinking which was something that I was doing organically became something that I because conscious off and paid attention to how I was structuring it in my head with relevance to what was needed from the question. This helped me to get my accuracy in solving the Hard question correct high. The scholarinium at some point became very addictive to me. I cant wait for the upgraded version to with more analytics in it! This will be a huge plus to all the new test takers.

The second aspect on my CR that eGMAT added value was to look at my ‘takt time’ or my natural time that I was spending my time on getting the question correct. The video analytics which DJ provided me solidified my thesis that I needed a process improvement in approaching the question and also helped develop a sense of structuring. 

4.	Hard Quant: I am a natural math lover and I trust my process how I work with numbers so I did not take the math course even though DJ kept insisting me to take the newly launched quant program which I thought covered the basic in a well structured manner again focused on really understanding whats happening behind the numbers. Which is something I love about eGAMT. Where I took the most value from is the Quant scholarinium which can be timed and readily available solution to any question. I loved the way eGMAT structured Quant into 5 sections and I could use them individually to raise the difficulty level to hunt down my weaknesses and improve my speed. This was one of the key take-aways. I actually love the hard questions in eGMAT which tend to take a lot of time which I were I learnt he hard lesson to let go of questions that are taking a lot of time. Again this was a huge challenge to the ego when you pride yourself of your quant. This actually helped in my exam where I could pace myself and make a better decision with the exam. 
5.	The support : The one big value I took from eGAMT especially during the entire process is, there was always someone I could talk to during this whole journey. At time during the process you a bit by yourself and need that comforting understanding and analytical conversation which the eGMAT support team so excellently delivers. They supported me on weekends late hours and I always had the confidence that I would get a reply in the next 24 hours. This reliability is hard earned and as a business thinker I appreciate how well Rajat, Payal and team have developed this. 

Other than the aforementioned points eGMAT turned out to be the only resource I started to use and the only thing that was necessary for me other than the GMAT Prep test to get the feel. I loved the SIGMA X mocks actually more and wished there were more than just the 5 available because they give you a detailed analysis as much as your ESR and give you a real visual of your performance. Also the Strategic review which eGMAT keeps repeating through the course was a game changer in my prep approach. This helped me shoot from a 670 in one of my first GMAT PREP mocks to 750.

I hope you take a lot of value from this analysis and good wishes in your preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","3","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I enrolled with e-gmat after a friend's recommendation, which turned out to be a very good decision. I was mightily impressed with how structured the course is.

I would like to highlight the sections that I found helpful in my preparation.

Sentence Correction - If you are struggling with sentence correction, this is the course for you. The course builds the foundation and takes you through the details through an application-based approach, which worked pretty well in my case.

Critical Reasoning - I was particularly struggling with this section initially. The pre-thinking approach helped me a lot in streamlining my answers before diving into the answer choices and I was straight away able to eliminate the wrong answer choices.

Sigma-X - This is the closest to the actual test that you are going to get after the official mocks. The block-wise analysis at the end of each test helps you analyze each section in detail. The analysis is presented in a manner it is presented in the final ESR, which will help you assess the time you spend in each block/type of question.

Overall, I would highly recommend e-gmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=80#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Instructor","I signed up to eGMAT in February at a point when I was feeling quite lost in terms of where to take my eGMAT preparation next. Close to a year after starting my GMAT prep my score had been stalled at 670 for several months and despite trying another online course, reading countless posts on the GMAT club forum and even a 1-1 tuition session I couldnt figure out how to make my mark budge. In particular my quant score was stuck at a very low percentile.

Coincidentally I came across the eGMAT youtube channel and after watching a few of their free webinars I was convinced this could be the missing ingredient in my preparation. After finally breaking the 700 barrier this past weekend I can confirm that that intuition was absolutely correct.

I'd like to highlight and elaborate on three key areas which were of mostly value to me in the course:
- A methodical and systematic approach to preparing for GMAT problems
- Tailored study plans further enhanced by adaptive modules that match the content to your level of skill
- Timely and personalised support from the wonderful stragey team - shout out to DJ!

Begining with the eGMAT methodology this is what really stuck out to me when I initially came across their webinars. The curriculum is thoroughly structured and well thought out, building from learning of basic concepts though to cementing of those concepts and finally test readiness. This process really forces students to learn topics in detail and really to leave no stone unturned which is essential for answering higher diffculty questions. In particular I loved the use of the process skills concept which breaks down GMAT questions into the requisite key sklls which apply across topics - this really was a game changer for me in understanding where I was going wrong on questions and allowed me to adress those specific issues, be it translating the question or drawing inferences. All in all the curriculum really changed my mindset when it came to preparing for the GMAT and made all the difference.

Secondly the curriculum was very tailored, prompting the student to input various data points prior to starting the course and also each module - this in the form of mini quizes to assess proficinecy. I loved thie way this allowed me to be efficient with my time and focus in on weaker areas. This was further supplemented by the amount of data points available from the Scholiranium platform which is eGMAT's in built question bank. Upon completion of tests I could see anything from average time to answer incorrect questions to a breakdown of accuracy by question type and module. This data made all the difference in preparation as I was able to really understand where I needed to focus my time.

Finally and most importantly was the support of DJ and the strategy team who were just an email away through the whole expereince. At multiple points in my preparation I was able to raise any doubts or concerns and was always met with friendly, personalised and insightful suggestions. Mot helpful were the personalised videos I would be sent providing analysis on my performance on quizes and instructing me on how to use the vast amount of data the eGMAT platform provides to enhance my performance.

All in all eGMAT was the game changer for me in my preparation and I could not recommend them more. My only regret is I ddin't find them sooner!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","","","","","",""

Quant : with the updated course material, the Egmat quant package is possibly the most comprehensive out there. Its very rigorous in its approach and is a tad bit more difficult than the actual test. The good news is that if you can do the Egmat quant, you can definitely do the GMAT quant :)
Verbal : well, what more can i say to an already cult favourite in this domain? Egmat verbal is the most lucid and structured course. It boasts of non-native speaker success and rightly so. It breaks down a seemingly absract subject into steps. (basically converts verbal into quant!)
Mentors at Egmat : I have only good things to say about the mentors here. They are extremely prompt. They even reply on sundays and the most important thing is that they are effective! My assigned mentor (Archit Bhargava) was a treat to work with. Archit gave me the confidence that i could ace the test with a very detailed feedback and easy-to-follow steps in my preparation.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","In February of 2021 I had given my first attempt of GMAT whilst preparing for the exam myself and on the D-day after the I completed the fourth section of the exam the computer displayed a message: 

“You’ve have scored 660 (Q48 V32), do you accept the score?”

Even before going to the exam, I had decided that anything less than 700 and I will cancel my score, no second thoughts required. After returning home, I was thinking how to go ahead for the second attempt. Now that scored a 720, I would like to give my review of the E-GMAT.

Why I chose E-GMAT?

During the preparation for my 1st attempt, I had attended Webinars from a couple of test-prep companies, amongst which, E-GMAT webinar hosted by Rajat S. showcased their approach towards solving the verbal problems using pre-thinking, meaning based approach, etc. This approach was what I was looking for if I had to confidently improve on the existing scores especially in Verbal. In the webinar he demoed a few questions and applied the above processes, thus instilling confidence in them.

So, I reached out to them over email and shared with them my ESR for the 1st attempt to know how deep in the water I was. Based on it, Dhananjay - the mentor – and I reached on the plan of action to follow for the next 8 weeks.



My Journey with E-GMAT in three parts 1. Course 2. Mentorship 3. Testing platform 

1.	Course 

Verbal course is one of the best out there, if not the best. In the learning phase it doesn’t put pressure on for the timing. Its priority is set i.e., accuracy first, speed second. And slowly and steadily my timings improved naturally as part of applying the process so many times.

Master Comprehension is an under-rated part of the course, it is first module that you go through, but in my Opinion is the most crucial one for it builds the base onto which other concepts would eventually function.

Meaning based approach (SC) and Pre-thinking method (CR) are no B.S. methods in that they don’t let you waste time on answer choice which are grammatically and logically correct but are not in line with the question (helps you in hard questions).

Though I did not spend enough time on RC (since improvement wasn’t required in this section), I had completed the core concepts of Reading strategies and these are perfect for any one who is struggling with the long complex passages.

Quant course has recently been revamped based on many user reviews and bringing it to the same high level of Verbal Course. The course itself is skill adaptive, once you take the diagnostic test for each module, you are given next course of action based on your accuracy, thus saving you valuable time so that you can focus on the areas which need your attention.

One of the greatest strengths of E-GMAT, in my opinion, is their forums, build over last 10 years; any questions you have would most likely have already been asked and answered, in rare cases where they aren’t, you post it there and get the answer usually within 24 hours. Whilst making the post you are asked to put forth your analysis so that they can understand if there is any flaw in your thinking. 


2.	Mentorship

During the course, the mentor assigned to me was Dhananjay Lowe. Since the very first call, Dhananjay knew what plan would be most effective and doing so what would be the next steps. As an example, I was worried what my timings would be in the exam as I was taking a long time in the process application initially, but he reassured me that I don’t need to worry about it, but still, that didn’t stop me from doing so. In hindsight though, his advice was correct as I had improved my timings in Test Readiness stage (more on that below). 

After each of my exam or steps of the process I used to get back to him over email/ Zoom and discuss the way forward. These steps were based on various datapoints and analytics of the tests you give and are then zeroed in on. You can ask even a silly question (I don’t recommend you do that often ) and get a reply.

In the last 10 days before exam, I got a high specialised plan day wise on what I needed to do and also got insights on those steps as well.


3.	Testing Platform

E-GMAT uses two platforms Scholaranium and Sigma-X, both serve their individual purposes in your preparation.

Scholaranium is the platform where you go to do your test readiness, cementing and ability quizzes done and get insights on your performance and take corrective action. Cementing really nails the head when it comes to the learning concepts outlined in the courses. Every question has the forum discussion below it, so you can go through it once you are done reviewing your responses. The way the learning is split in to ability, cementing and test readiness allowed me to master the concepts in a structured manner.

Sigma-X is E-GMAT’s mock testing platform, which is very close to the actual GMAT in my opinion and much closer than other platforms that I have used (I’ve used Expert Global and TIME CAT). It uses block-wise difficulty to adapt to the test takers’ ability. It will give you all the analytics and datapoints for each test. You can choose the section format and exam format (test centre vs Online) prior to the start of the exam. (My last three scores were 730, 690, 750).

The explanations of the answer choices are well elaborated along with the video explanations, in every explanation you get a proper reason that make a choice incorrect. 

Overall, combined with the insights given by the Mentor and the data form the various test you would give while preparing is what enabled me to improve the score from 660 to 720.


Where can E-GMAT improve on:

1.	May be increase the number of Sigma-X Mocks available (as of this review it is 5) 
2.	Have module for the AWA in the course. 
3.	The User Interface of the Sigma-X, if it is like the actual GMAT, then it would be better as you would get accustomed to the UX from the get go. Though, the current UX doesn’t hinder your test taking ability.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

I have gone through the GMAT club course reviews to finalize the same. After contemplating for such a long time I gave a shot at E-GMAT verbal online course. I am giving this review so that many students can be benefited. 

E-GMAT verbal course is very structured. As SC is my weakest part I have gone through the SC course. It focused purely on the basics of the SC and it meaning based approach is what needs to applauded. As we all know that GMAT verbal is basically not a grammar test and tests your reasoning skills like intended meaning E-GMAT course helps us to focus in that way. 

Pre-Thinking in Critical Reasoning helped me to reduce the time needed to answer and also very helpful. I struggled with Assumption questions for quite a time but with the above said approach I gained confidence and achieved 83 percentile in CR.

Also, needless to mention their scholaranium questions. These quizzes are customizable by topic/difficulty, but on top of that they have adaptive ability to develop test taking ability. The metrics that they provide has a lot of data that can can be used to identify any weak area with concept, timing or difficulty and work on it.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi Fellow Test-takers, 

Hope your preparations are going good. I just wanted to update you on how my GMAT journey has been. So, the milestone 700 has been in my target list from 2016, right when I got my first job.  To give a background, I am a finance guy with 4 years of Work experience based out of Bangalore aged about 24. 

Attempt1 :

Well, I did not research a lot about the exam and how I should prepare for it. Meanwhile, my work kept me busy and in the process the professional exams intrigued me and enrolled for a couple -CIPM and CFA. After finishing those, my focus got shifted to GMAT after gaining 2 years of work experience. So one of my friends who also struggled as I suggested that Princeton Review Private tutoring is good. So, me and him enrolled for the course. Well, it did not work for me as they have a very simple mindset and assumed everyone knows basics about the exam and the syllabus. 

After giving a couple of mocks I realized something's wrong in my preparation. So went to GMAT club read a couple of reviews and purchased  E-GMAT verbal course in 2019. I went through the complete course couple of times and took the Exam in Aug 2019 only to find out that my preparation was not good enough to beat the 700 score though my  performance  in Scholaranium was good. So I ordered the ESR and asked for Rajat's opinion. He said I should give it a try again. 

Sources: PR Material, E-GMAT Verbal Course, GMAT Club Tests, MGMAT for Quant.
Score: 600 (Q48 V25)
 
Attempt2: (2020 - 2021)

This time I decided that I will not spend a lot of money on Prep and hence completely relied on GMAT Club, Free webinars from various Test Prep Companies and  GMAT Club points to buy Veritas Tests and GMAT Tests.

So before starting my prep, I looked at my ESR and reflected on how I prepared myself in the past for the exam. I realized that I considered GMAT to be of the same type as those professional exams that I took and I prepared in the same way.  So, I realized that I need to approach it differently by going about practicing questions gave an official mock and my Quant score is still at 48 but my verbal score was 30. I started preparing in August 2020 focusing completely on Verbal SC and RC. I made sure that I do a couple of passages from GMAT club daily irrespective and trust me, it just increases your comprehension speed for SC and CR as well.   After a month into my preparation I got CORONA and luckily recovered from it. 

Post which, I started my preparation in February 2021 again, using MGMAT Quant and Verbal books, RON Videos, OGs for practice. I gave a mock sometime at the end of February and realized I could only get my score to 650. My major issues are with CR.

E-GMAT's Entry into My Prep again: 

I attended E-GMATs Quant Workshop during the beginning of March, post which I got a link for a free strategy call with one of their experts -Vaibhav, who showed me a profile of one their students in Scholaranium. I realized that there is a sequence to follow for improvements in each of the verbal and Quant sections. I saw a gradual progress in each of the sections using what they call Cementing Quizzes. He suggested me to take a Sigma X mock and shared the link for the test. In-fact he even followed me up to check whether I have taken the test. So, I gave it on a Sunday and got 660 with a very low CR score. I went through my performance using the analytics of Sigma X mocks. I think they gave me a pretty accurate representation of my performance in each of the sub sections. And then I had a call with Vaibhav again and we analyzed my score in Sigma X mock and he offered me a one month course. 

After a lot of speculation I decided to take up the course and pushed my exam by a month to April 22 2021. So, the first thing Vaibhav asked me to do was to drop an email to E-GMAT's support team for the plan and to decide how I should prepare. I tell you they are very prompt and they analyzed my performance again in Sigma -X mock and my ESR and they assigned me a mentor DJ (name sounds fancy I know) who  forwarded me something called E-GMAT's bible for preparing GMAT. It was pretty elaborate: mentioned when I should take Quizzes to cement my methods, what are the target scores I should aim for in each of the Quizzes and what I should do in case I did not get the target scores. I decided to follow it blindly and also built a study plan using the E_GMAT's platform.

Verbal Prep:  

I am not promoting or anything, I think everybody who's been through E-GMAT's verbal course would tell that the course's Master comprehension and SC module are really good. After going through the course I can see my scores improved in SC and RC tremendously but I still had trouble with CR. Here I reached out again and he gave me a plan as to how I should revise and take quizzes for CR. Believe me it worked. 

QUANT Prep:

To be very frank I liked their Quant course better than their verbal. It implemented something called XPert architecture in which every sub concept in Quant starts with a Diagnostic quiz including Medium and Hard questions and suggests you which sections you can skip and which you cannot based on your performance. I realized that I had gaps in Word Problems and Geometry and frankly I liked how Shwetha ma'am used real world explanations in Geometry. One small thing I didn't like about Quant questions in E-GMAT is that they are pretty dense and the actual GMAT questions are not that dense and focus more on logic and E-GMAT's solutions are more process oriented. There are gaps in the course, which you can cover from GMAT Club Quant book. 

Overall: 

I did not get sufficient time to go through official questions this time but I was sure that E-GMAT scholranium questions covered all the topics. What I liked about Sigma-X mocks is that for every test you take, an additional 200 questions get added to your Scholaranium. By today, I have about 1000 questions in Quant and 1000 questions in Verbal and I finished four of Sigma X mocks in which I score, 660, 680, 750 and 700.  The forum moderators are also prompt in answering the queries and it did cover all my doubts. 

Score: 690 (Q49 , V36)

I started with the verbal course. I did every video in the course. 
Out of the three sections, the content on SC worked the most for me. The meaning based approach helped me improve considerably on SC. 

For CR, Practicing from eGMAT Scholaranium helped me improve considerably on CR. 

Once I completed the course, eGMAT chalked out the number of quizzies that I need to give before I move to the next stage in the preparation - this really helped me as it ensured that I only move on once I am thorough with a section. 

For Quant, eGMAT has revamped its quant section. I had given the previous quant course, this once is more robust. I was able to drastically improve in number properties after the new course.

After finishing both the sections, I worked with DJ on how I can prepare towards the final leg of writing the exam. He helped me with a step-by-step guide. 

In addition, he would also help with the quizzies, the accuracy I should attain etc. This I thought was imperative to score well on the mocks. Once I started giving the mocks, DJ after each mock would send a video with an analysis of the mock along with the next steps to improve. 

Additionally, as and when I plateaued in a section, I received the inputs from the experts on how I can mitigate and improve. That again worked really well for me. 

I plan to continue to leverage Scholaranium and build quizzies to improve for my next attempt.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

While doing your research online, you may come across a lot of resources to study from. You tend to get confused, but this course is well structured in terms of concepts and practice questions for each of the sections under the verbal umbrella.  This course provides a systematic approach to solving the question; this approach helps one spot the correct answer than coming to the answer by eliminating the incorrect ones. The approaches not only improve the accuracy but also helps in time management as GMAT often puts similar options to confuse the candidate which will consume a lot of time in answer by elimination approach. 

In addition, what stood out for me was the constant support from the e-GMAT team. Their online support via email is great. The team is quite responsive and ready to help you as you proceed with the preparation. They will solve simplest of doubts and answer your questions thoroughly.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Today I received my GMAT score: 700/800, a 140 point increase achieved in little more than three months!! I couldn’t be more happy, but at the same time more grateful to the e-GMAT team.

Their support throughout my learning journey was immense. The strategy team is always (ALWAYS = 7/7) there to support you and provide corrective measures to your learning plan. The software itself, provides the ultimate in class teaching and mentor simulation. They prepare you for this ability test by indeed teaching those required abilities by means of diagnostic quizzes, concept files teaching the core concept skills, followed by practice quizzes to apply those concepts and eventually solve GMAT level 700+ questions. This method, they apply for all Verbal and Quant. Their Quant just got updated to Quant 2.0.  I got to know e-GMAT as the best way to optimise your Verbal skills; today I equally value their Verbal and Quant course. Both allowed me to excel!

In the last two weeks, I got additional coaching from DJ (Dhananjay Lowe). After my first GMAT attempt in March, he reached out to me to join the Last Mile Program. He provided me with a hyper-specific plan to boost my score and get that 700 score. E-GMAT allowed me to significantly increase my score, the mentorship by DJ gave this extra boost to excel truly.

What I really liked about e-gmat, is their data-oriented approach. Thanks to the data they collect and share with their students, there should be no surprises during your GMAT exam. Their know-how allows them and yourself to estimate your ability and therefore reflect an estimate of your score. The mock prep tests by e-GMAT (Sigma-X Mocks) also provided an accurate estimate of my score.

In short: I would have NEVER achieved this 140 point increase without the e-GMAT software, their strategy team, and DJ. First, I bought official prep content by GMAC, but soon I realised I needed more. E-GMAT was exactly what I needed. Although no one would officially recommend studying for GRE using GMAT tools, I also took GRE between my two GMAT attempts and got a score of 322 on this exam.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","","Location","I utilized e-GMAT for my first attempt and scored a 650 with 3-4 months of preparations. 

I found the course beneficial on two major fronts - 

1. Filtered study material - e-GMAT's prep material is refined to what you'll actually need for the test. Unlike the books, this course is straightforward and teaches only what is required and in an efficient manner.

2. Engaging - with all the analytics, prep videos, and routine targets, I found this product very engaging and keeps you on a defined timeline.

The SC course is hands down one of the best course out there. It teaches you the right error types and optimum process to boil it down to the right answer.

In CR, the pre-thinking approach is efficient and certainly helps when one is encountered a hard level CR question.

Scholaranium is a great question bank with exceptional capabilities. It's inbuilt analytics shows you exactly at which point you are faltering and which topics needs the most attention.

Sigma-X Mocks are one of the best mock tests out there in the market. The analytics is great and the definite time limit pushes one to replicate actual test conditions.

Finally the support is ""Extraordinary"" - answers to your queries are prompt and experts go above and beyond to help you succeed. I had calls with Payal, Rajat, and Shaarang for my re-takes and everyone was very supportive and gave me the required feedback based on my previous tests and eGMAT data.

After my first attempt, I gave couple more attempts but couldn't improve my score past 660. Though my quant was constant at 49, my verbal was fluctuating. I finally took help from a private GMAT tutor to help me increase my verbal score and was able to score a 700.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Location","I stumbled upon e-GMAT after taking my first attempt of the real GMAT exam and scoring poorly. I knew I had to dive deeper into concepts in CR and SC specifically and also improve my concepts in Quant to reduce ""silly mistakes"". After comparing a lot of courses, I finally decided to give e-GMAT a shot because of how well their material was presented and the  effort they had put into their course videos and mock exams (which I got to experience first hand during the 7 day trial period). The emphasis on collecting meaningful data from the quiz and exam performances and the elaborate reviews which followed were what instilled confidence in me that I had chosen the correct course to help prepare me for the GMAT. 

A few aspects of the course which I specifically liked and used were:

1. The verbal course: I think its the most exhaustive verbal course I have come across. The deep dive into the concepts of SC especially helped me tackle the harder questions which I previously had to guess my way through. 

2. CR - I understood that the different types of CR questions warranted a different way of thinking. The key learning of coming up with assumptions after reading the passage before looking at answer choices was a great tip which eventually saved me a lot of time during those questions. 

3. RC - I was relatively comfortable with RC because I enjoy reading hence I never had too much trouble here. However, the amount of passages in the course helped to sharpen my skills in reading passages of various topics/subjects quickly and to grasp the main point of the passages. 

4. The entire quant course was really helpful. If you're rusty with certain topics, definitely go through the quant course.

5. The part of the course which helpedme the most was the Scholaranium. It's basically a huge database of questions which help to ""solidify"" the concepts of both Quant and Verbal and the question bank is almost endless. This is what stood out to me and helped me the most. 

6.The sigmaX Mocks: The difficulty of these mocks is just right. A good feature of these mocks is the absence of a pause button, forcing you to prepare yourself to sit for a 3 hour exam with the same mindset as you would during the real thing. As mentioned above, the review at the end of the exam shows you exactly where you struggled, which type of questions took you the most time to solve and also which concepts you need to brush up on. I found this data very helpful because it saved a lot of time during the review and I was able to spend more time on working on those concepts. 

Lastly, the support e-GMAT provided was the best! Hats off to experienced coaches like Dhananjay and the others who replied to my endless emails about questions and concepts and even helped review my exams telling me which areas to focus on. 

Overall, I am very happy that I chose e-GMAT. I cannot talk about every online course out there but I would recommend this course to every single person who wants to succeed at the GMAT and start their MBA journey on a positive note.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=81#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I started my GMAT prep in Jan’21 and after reading through a couple of articles figured that 3 months should be the ideal time. I started with the official guides and Manhattan strategy books. Although these helped me understand the concepts, I realized that my improvement was limited and I did not have the right approach to confidently eliminate wrong options. At this point, I started looking at the various prep courses available online.

After attending a free 1:1 session, I decided to join e-GMAT course in Feb/M. They provided me with a personalized study plan taking into consideration my current strengths and weaknesses. This made sure that I was not wasting time on topics that I was decently good at and instead devoted that time to areas where I could make significant improvement.

SC – My accuracy was comparatively higher so I was not required to do this course entirely. However their meaning based approach (although it sounds like the most logical thing) really helps eliminate options that might be grammatically correct

CR & RC – I did both these courses and the eGMAT approach helped me reduce the time I spent on these questions and also improve accuracy

Mock Tests – I gave 4 official mock tests which helped me evaluate my performance at different stages of my preparation. They are probably the best estimates of the actual score. However, the official mocks do not provide a detailed analysis of your performance on each section and the time taken per question. In this regard, I really liked the SigmaX mock from eGMAT because they provide multiple statistics to gauge your performance. 

Since I have been working fulltime since the past 4 years, I did not know many people around me who had attempted the GMAT recently and could advise me on my preparation. eGMAT not only provided the online course and mock tests, but also provided continual guidance on my performance. Their strategy consultant DJ worked with me during the last 2 weeks before my exam and provided a day to day plan for the final leg of preparation. He also provided detailed analysis of my mocks, error logs and tips to improve my accuracy.

Test Day – I scheduled my exam at 7am in a nearby center. I was comfortable testing at this time and had given all my mocks at the same time. I started with the verbal section and found it to be a bit harder than the mocks. During the break, I was expecting the test center setup to be similar to the GRE exam which I had given a couple of years earlier. However due to the pandemic and our county restrictions, we were asked to go outside the building to have water or snacks during the breaks. Because of this, I misjudged the break time and arrived late after my first break. I ended up losing 3.5 minutes in the quant section and this led to panic which definitely affected my performance. During the 2nd break, I made sure that I arrive early however by now I was aware that my performance so far was not upto my expectation.

Final Score – I received a score of 700 (Q48 V38). Although not a bad score, it was definitely below my target score of 740+. I was consistently scoring Q50 on my mocks so I think Q48 was definitely a true reflection of my ability. 

Next Steps – I am planning to reappear for the exam in 4 weeks. I am hoping to not mess up quant as I did last time. Also, I think there is scope for improvement in my verbal ability and so I am focusing most of my efforts there. Hopefully I will have better news the next time I post an exam review. Fingers crossed ","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by gmat club tests","","Location","My GMAT journey started in the Spring of 2020. Like most other GMAT candidates, I started by studying from books by a big brand test prep company and the Official Guides. I familiarized myself with all the stuff that is tested on the GMAT and studied for three months, thinking that was enough time. I took a few mock tests in that period, but my score was never consistent. My best score was 670(Q48, V34), but I was never able to get that score again and was never able to break the threshold. After three months of prep, I took a break from the GMAT. Demoralized and frustrated, I thought that the GMAT wasn’t for me. 
Months passed, but I was not happy with myself. I always thought to myself “What if I was just following the wrong strategy until now?” Finally, at the beginning of 2020, I committed to preparing for the GMAT again but decided to change my approach this time. After a lot of research, I decided to sign up for the e-GMAT verbal course. I heard about the company several times on the GMAT Club forum, and watched some of their live sessions on YouTube, but I finally decided to give them a try. After spending a little over two months on the e-GMAT course, I can definitely see the improvement in my verbal score. I was able to go from low 30’s to high 30’s and even a 40 one time on the mocks. Below are some of the reasons why the e-GMAT verbal course stood out to me:
For SC, the e-GMAT meaning based approach is a game changer. I had gotten decent at eliminating wrong answers by noticing splits in the answer choices, but sometimes ended up with two answers to choose from and ended up guessing between those two. The verbs module was the most helpful and the content was delivered in a way that made it easy to visualize the timeline of events happening in a sentence. 
For CR, the structure-based approach helped me break down the passage and understand it better. I had studied the negation technique for solving assumption questions earlier but was never quite able to apply that well in an argument. The e-GMAT approach to pre-thinking falsification questions helped me apply the negation technique in a better way, and this approach helped me improve my CR accuracy. 
The RC section of verbal has been the trickiest for me. It’s something that you can’t guess on entirely and it can be the most time-consuming portion of the verbal section. I am not a fast reader and don’t comprehend well what I read. My biggest fear in the verbal section is getting two RC passages back-to-back, and then getting derailed for the rest of the test. The submersion technique taught by e-GMAT helped me get involved in the passage and this definitely helped me do better on RC.  
I found the e-GMAT’s scholaranium to be a great source for verbal questions. After exhausting the OG, I didn’t have a good repository of questions to practice from, but I was surprised by the level of questions that scholaranium has. The analytics provided by the e-GMAT tool is also great. It really helps you analyze your weak areas and helps measure accuracy. Also, the kind of support provided by the e-GMAT team is great. Though I didn’t ask a lot of questions on the forum, as the thread below each question had detailed discussions between students, who had similar doubts, and the mentors, the few times that I did ask a question, I got a prompt response from Kanupriya. 
Looking back, I think the e-GMAT verbal course added the most value to my GMAT prep journey. I would highly recommend it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","In a nutshell, E gmat is definitely worth every penny invested.
I chose it after going through several reviews on gmat club and going through their videos on youtube. The platform is really well designed and organized. There are numerous modules which covers every aspect tested on the gmat.

I was particularly weak in CR and my initial ability was in the 40th percentile. At the end of my prep, i was at the 85th percentile. The SC course is really comprehensive and beautifully planned out. It can help improve anybodys ability tremendously if the instructions and methodology taught is religiously followed. Overall, the Verbal module was incredible and is a huge strength on the platform. 

The new Quant 2.0 is amazing and really clean. It teaches the necessary skills required to tackle pretty much any kind of question tested on the gmat. I have used both the previous version and the new one and there is a significant difference in terms of the approach for the exam. The modules are systematic and the questions are of all difficulties to give you a flavor of what the exam will feel like.

Scholaranium is an absolutely amazing tool and question bank that gives you pin point details about the ability in various topics and subtopics and helps identify weak spots and rectify them. The attention to detail and the world class quality o fthe questions really gives you a good feel of the type of questions youd see in the exam. If leveraged right, this can save a ton of time during prep.

The sigma mocks are by far the closest mocks apart from the official mocks that i have written which resembles the actual gmat exam. The insights that the sigma mocks offer are so so valuable. Even the official mocks dont give this much data about timings and weaknesses. It is an absolute necessity to gauge progress from time to time and validate your ability. 

Lastly, the mentorship program that I was invited to be a part of was the icing on the cake. DJ has been a fantastic mentor and has guided me throughout the process. His key insights into my progress from time to time gave me a clear direction to move in. It adds a lot of value to the preparation. Making a structured plan and identifying my weaknesses. Video analyses of the performance of my mock gave me a new perspective of my performance and what I needed to do to overcome those minor challenges.

I highly recommend EGMAT to anyone who is serious about their MBA and who really want to achieve a high score. It is worth the money.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

Disappointed, I began trying to figure out how to improve my score and stumbled upon e-gmat. After using their program for my second attempt, I can say for sure that if you are on the fence about signing up with e-gmat then- GO FOR IT!.
Verbal
1. SC- One of the best section with foundation building concept videos. I think this is the best module prepared by them. Meaning based approach is really great.
2. CR & RC- Entire approach was around understanding the passages and thinking critically with out of box solutions.
PS: No mugging up (most imp :) )

Quant
Their Quant course gives all the concepts required for the test and trains us on the process which makes solving difficult questions in less than two minutes easier. E-GMAT’s quant question bank is very comprehensive and difficulty level of the questions is higher than that of the ones in the official guide or GMAT prep. Once we get used to solving harder questions, quant in the actual test turns out to be much easier.
Another good feature that helped me the most is their doubt forum- it has so many already solved doubts that it'll only help you learn more.Go through the already solved doubts of a tough question and you will see different approaches and why the provided solution is the best one. Their courses need no introduction, their verbal and quant will prepare you for everything that will be thrown at you during test day, the scholaranium will help you improve your accuracy and the sigma x mocks will help you fine tune your strategy for D-day.I wish they had more mocks.Their support has always solved my doubts within a day, If you need help ,email them, they WILL help you in any way they can.Ill highly recommend them for any serious aspirant.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

I had been struggling alot with the verbal section before subscribing to the E-gmat course but the the way their verbal section is structured is just amazing. If you follow it as they you'll definitely see an improvement in your ability within 10 days. The prethinking skill in CR section is just amazing. Once you get the hang of it, it works like magic. You just have to be patient while preparing for the course. Initially when I subscribed I did not like the quant section as much but later on they have moved on to a new platform for quant known as ""expert"" which gives you rigorous practice and just embeds the concepts in your head. The strategy team is always ready to help you and you can mail them anytime and they will book a strategy session for you. The scholaranium of E-gmat if used efficiently is a gem.

																			by membership","Points","Location","Hi Everyone, 
I decided to prep for the GMAT in January 2019 and booked my GMAT exam for the 31st of March, 2019.
I thought three months will be enough for me to ace the paper and get a 700+ score. I did join an institute in New Delhi the institute had given me access to approximately 10 mock tests on its portal. 
I gave my first attempt and I got a 620. I was very surprised to see my score as I was doing pretty well in the mock tests given by this institute I had joined. 

I decided to start the Egmat course immediately after my first attempt and spent quite a lot of time on the verbal section. The online lectures really helped me out and made me feel extremely confident. After a month or so, I started solving questions on the EGMAT scholaranium and I was able to improve my accuracy each passing day. I again gave the GMAT in August 2019. This time I ended up scoring a 610. 
I was taken aback but I was still determined to get a better score. 
I decided to refer other online material in order to widen my horizon and get exposed to more number of questions. I gave my next attempt in October 2019. I ended up scoring a 620 again.

It was only then that I decided to share the enhanced score reports with the Egmat team so that I could get some clarity on why I was getting such poor scores even after putting in so much effort. 

I was advised to just concentrate on the time I was spending on each question. Thats about all. I was advised to create tests on my scholaranium account and time them well.

I gave my 4th attempt on December 9th, 2019. I finally scored a 710. The only reason why I was able to score a 710 was because of the little change I had made in my approach courtesy the advice given by the Egmat team.

I was still determined to do much better in the test. It was in the month of September 2020 that I again sent out a mail to egmat asking for more help. Nava Dehingia from Egmat replied on the mail and set up a zoom call with me for about half an hour. 
He had asked me to send all my ESRs and he thoroughly went through my scholaranium account to understand my pain points. 

So, it was on that call that Nava made me realise the importance of analysing the questions I was getting wrong. All this while, I was focussing on getting the accuracy up. But I wasn't focusing on my weak points. Nava took me through each of the three sections in Verbal and each of the two sections in quant and asked me to go through my weak areas. Very methodically he asked me to prepare smaller tests focusing ONLY on my weak areas. 

For the next 25 days, I just followed Nava's advice. I did nothing else. I just strengthened my weak areas and kept going through the things I was getting wrong.

On 1st October, 2021 I gave my final attempt and I got a 740 - V40 Q 50.

My score would not have been possible had I not been determined enough to keep at it. But more importantly, the question bank,  which EGmat provides was the game changer for me. I struggled for 1.5 years to get a good score. I went through so much online material. But nothing comes close to the OG and the Scholaranium questions. 
And not to forget, I truly owe the 740 to Nava. His advice changed my approach drastically. Had it not been for him, I probably would have still been giving the GMAT.

Thanks EGMAT for the prompt replies and unconditional support. @Nava, you are GODSEND. Thank you so much for everything you did to ensure I get a 740.

All the best guys. Please feel free to reach out in case you need any help.

- VALUE/PRICE: A Brazilian friend of mine told me that E-GMAT had a great solution with a fair price and after reviewing other players in the market, I got to the same conclusion and signed up for it. I suggest taking both Verbal/Quant courses in a bundle because that will be enough for you to crack the GMAT and it has a good price.
- VERBAL: This is their main strength. There is a lot of content out there teaching you the WHAT (the concepts), but the thing about GMAT is that you must master the HOW to solve the questions. That's exactly the E-GMAT's value proposition and once you master the methods for SC, RC, CR it's impossible for you to forget. The concepts are well taught too, but the methods are the best part of it.
- QUANT: There is a detailed explanation of all the concepts throughout the course and they are mixed with diagnostic and quizzes, making sure one fully understands it. One suggestion I'd like to make is that I feel the Verbal course is superior to Quant because of its focus on the methods. Even though there are methods in Quant, there are just too many of them compared to Verbal.
- ANALYTICS: It doesn't matter if you study 8 hours in a day if you don't get the results you need, so you need to be smart about it. The best way for that is using data to understand what you don't know yet. E-GMAT does exactly that. Their practice questions (Scholaranium) is fantastic and it will allow you not to fool yourself and focus on what you need to. You will see your scores per VERBAL/QUANT accordingly to each topic requested on the GMAT.

If you are Brazilian, don't go for the local solutions. E-GMAT is great, it has an amazing price for what it offers and it will help you in your journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by membership","Points","Location","When I attempted GMAT 3 years back, I scored 660, with a decent quant score but a dismal verbal score. I started preparing for GMAT again around October 2020, with an aim to score 700+. I initially relied on questions from GMATClub and OG, and after a few months of practice gave my first official mock test, scoring a 660. Again, I noticed a stark contrast between my quant and verbal scores. Realizing that I needed serious help with verbal, I decided to opt for e-GMAT.

The video lectures offered by e-GMAT for verbal are unparalleled in terms of quality. The lectures start with explaining the basics, and then show how questions are solved by breaking down each option and eliminating options one by one. I learned a lot of strategies to solve various types of questions, such as placement of verb-ing words for SC questions, negation strategy for CR questions, summarizing RC paragraphs, etc.

e-GMAT Scholaranium provides plenty of questions. You get to apply the strategies learned from video lectures on questions of varying difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard). Scholaranium comes with a dashboard to help you understand the areas/types of questions that need improvement. Apart from the video lectures and Scholaranium, e-GMAT also provides a myriad of helpful articles on their website, and I often found myself going back to these articles again and again to refresh my memory.

In conclusion, e-GMAT helped me overcome the verbal score plateau, and I would recommend their verbal course to everyone aiming to score 700+ on GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I decided to take the GMAT a few months back I was exploring web for test preps. I am an engineer and people I know around me do not take GMAT that often, so web search was the best option I had to find the right course for me. Initially I got some books from another leading test prep service provider and I just realised that the verbal section was not doing it for me. People on GMAT Club say that it is easier to improve on SC, whereas no matter how much I tried, my growth in SC was stuck! So in my search for course for SC, I found some reviews of e-GMAT on GC and I decided to give it a try. Now, looking back, I am glad that I did!

Here are my thoughts on the overall course prep-

1. For verbal, e-GMAT is probably the most effective course prep for someone who is not a grammar nazi. Their meaning based approach actually works- its not just another jargon created by the test prep providers. The quality of questions are comparable to OG and the real exam, and the difficulty of the questions made me comfortable in facing any surprises in the verbal. Their focus on grammar is limited to absolute essential and the structured steps suggested in the course got ingrained into me as I moved ahead with the course. The pre-thinking approach they teach in CR seems long and counter-intuitive initially but it works like magic once you get a grasp on it.

2. Quant was already a stronger area for me because of my background but I felt that their quant section has a very good step by step approach to getting to harder level questions for someone for whom quant is a problem area.

3. Scholaranium is the platform that they use to develop test taking ability. Obviously the quizzes customisable by topic/difficulty, but on top of that they have adaptive ability quizzes to each of the area in verbal and quant to develop test taking ability. The metrics that they provide has a lot of data that can can be used to identify any weak area with concept, timing or difficulty and work on it. 

4. The Sigma-X mocks that the course offers are very closely comparable to the real thing. My exam score very closely matches with my Sigma-X mock scores. In my opinion, the quality and difficulty of the questions are very much in line with the real thing.

5. Most importantly, the e-GMAT team is very approachable in every way. They arrange weekly webinars on various topics which are extremely effective. Plus, whenever I wrote to them for guidance, they have reverted quick with extremely valuable inputs on strategy, identifying weak areas and even helped me plan study routines at times. A couple of weeks before the exam, when I reached out to them, they actually helped me plan the full weeks leading up to the exam day! Honestly, this was not something I was even looking for when I subscribed to the course!

I am writing this review because I felt that the reviews I've read on GC helped me when I was exploring course to choose from and I believe my experience should help someone else too. I think if you are planning on taking the GMAT exam, you can't go wrong with e-GMAT. Period.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=82#","0","0","","","","","",""

After reading multiple satisfied reviews about e-gmat on gmatclub, I decided to purchase the online course. I think this is the best course out there because of the following key reasons- 
Quant 2.0 course - 
1. Quant 2.0 course has covered all topics that are tested on the exam. 
2. It is very well structured and you are 80% test ready by the time you have gone through the concept files and the practice tests in the module.
3. Quant Scholaranium takes care of the remaining 20% preparation. The question bank is very comprehensive and there are no similar questions. So the more amount of time you spend on Quant Scholaranium the better you get.
Verbal course - 
1. Verbal course is very seamless. After going through the Master comprehension module I could make sense of any sentence structure very easily. 
2. The SC concepts seem very logical. The meaning-based approach is taught throughout the course, this approach comes to great aid while solving Hard SC questions. 
3. In CR - Pre-thinking approach, taught in the course, helps to tackle every CR question and improves your accuracy.
4. RC - Concepts taught in SC and Master comprehension module helps a lot in understanding a long passage, and with sufficient practice on Verbal scholaranium, reading skills improve.
5. Verbal Scholaranium again has a very comprehensive question bank and the solution explanations are the best one can find on the internet.

One of the unique points about the e-gmat course is the graphical data that is available to you at all times.
How much of a module you have completed, What is your accuracy in different practice tests/ quizzes/ different level questions, How much time you are taking in different question types? It's all there. And it really helps when you are following a strict timeline.

The support from the e-gmat support team is also pretty amazing. I have received some amazing responses from DJ [Dhananjay] whenever I mailed him. His insights really helped. 
The subject matter experts are very quick to respond and they write out very detailed explanations, clarifying your doubts at all times. Detailed explanations from Stacey, Vipul, Shraddha really helped in clearing a lot of my doubts.

Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone.

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Location","GMAT is an exam that requires a structured study approach. e-Gmat verbal/quant online course certainly ensures that we study methodically and review our own performances at regular intervals. Let's tackle the review section-wise -:

Sentence Correction
A) The course is very good with the course divided into multiple sub-sections i.e. SV Agreement, Verb-Tenses, Parallelism etc.
B) Also, there are multiple articles within the course that addresses certain myths/misconceptions about the GMAT, and that is great addition to the course.
C) The quality of questions for SC in the Scholaranium platform is amazing. These questions will certainly enhance your understanding.

Critical Reasoning
A) The course starts with some basics such as definitions for Premise and Conclusion.
B) The Assumption module is the most important here and all the relevant concepts with respect to Pre-thinking are articulated efficiently. This certainly enhanced my learning and understanding of the CR questions.

Reading Comprehension
A) The course tackles each type of questions i.e Inference, Main point, data based etc.
B) The crux of this course is that we understand the passage properly one go, make paragraph summaries and focus on structure words such as However, but, In addition, for example etc.

Quant
A) The course is divided beautifully that you'll learn all the concepts organically
B) I've tried 2-3 course for Quant but e-GMAT quant course is probably the most relevant in terms of difficulty and nature of questions.
C) e-GMAT has introduced a Quant 2.0 with more learning opportunities and an enhanced course. Special mention to Shweta Koshija for the her explanation in the Quant section, specifically Geometry.

Scholaranium
A) This is without doubt the USP of the e-GMAT course. The quality of questions and explanations is amazing.
B) The amount of data you can get from the course is more than sufficient to identify your weaknesses, timing issues and strong areas.

Sigma-X Mocks
1) You can get an ESR like data post the completion of the mock
2) There are videos as well on how to analyze the mocks and that certainly helps a lot
3) The verbal is again on point but I felt that quant was a bit tougher than what you're likely to face on the actual GMAT.
To conclude, your actual GMAT score won't actually fluctuate much from the Sigma-X mock scores and you can rely on them for analysis.

e-GMAT Mentorship
A) I would sincerely thank Nava and DJ (Dhananjay Lowe) for their guidance throughout my prep.
B) The email responses to my queries were crisp and to the point. The strategic advice I received was invaluable and gave me the direction to work for.

Overall, I would highly recommend the e-GMAT course for both Quant and Verbal. It's a one stop shop for the GMAT prep.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","0","0","","","","","",""

For verbal, the methods are simple, and honestly important. The egmat team uses logic rather than some gimmicks to teach verbal section. I would recommend the course for any beginner out there. It is important to receive feedback from a mentor to understand what you're missing.

																			by score report","Points","Location","A Brief Background: I am a IIT Kharagpur graduate of class of 2015. I started my preparation of GMAT in March 2020 but was not structured at all in my approach. I ended up scoring 680 (Q50, V31) in October 2020 (Online GMAT) and felt that this score doesn't depict my true ability. I gave 2nd attempt of Online GMAT in March 2021 and scored 720 (Q50, V36), but this time eGMAT's structured approach and mentorship came to my rescue.

eGMAT tool: A very comprehensive portal to build your ability and level up your score. I barely touched any other resource for SC and RC. I was really impressed by eGMAT's meaning based approach and pre-thinking approach. Talking about Scholaranium: The best question bank in the GMAT industry, the explanations are so comprehensive that it helps you learn and cement your concepts even further.

eGMAT Mentor (DJ): I reached out to eGMAT for support in verbal section. I lacked time management skills and wanted to score v42+. DJ not only analysed my ability in each of the verbal sections but also provided me with personalised SigmaX mock analysis. 
3 videos provided: I attempted 3 mocks and received personalized analysis for each of them. This analysis pointed following: my weak areas for revisit, how to improve on time management (block wise approach), and ability/accuracy required to score v42+.
These videos drove me into high paced learning and improvement because I realised the strategies to score higher. Also, it helped me course correct my 14 days study plan before GMAT. 

A net summary: I am still not satisfied with my score and I know my areas of improvement. I am receiving continuous support from DJ in my 3rd attempt. I highly recommend this course for everyone who wants to fasten up their preparation in structured approach.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by membership","","Instructor","I took the GMAT back in 2019 and wanted to improve on my score. So in mid-2020, I reached out to the E-GMAT team as I had been able to participate in some of their free online workshops over the past few months and had a positive impression on their teaching style. The E-GMAT team has been supportive since Day 1. I had an initial one-hour call with someone on the team and sent my ESR for review. Immediately, he was able to identify various weaknesses in my performance and suggested that I participate in their mentorship program, which was new at the time. One week later, I was introduced to DJ, who became my mentor and go-to contact person. 

During our initial call, DJ raised many important points about my ESR and came up with a detailed plan to work on my weaknesses. Every week, I would have a chat with him and he would tell me exactly what I needed to focus on from the E-GMAT course and their Scholarium question bank. Many people who struggle with GMAT studying lack structure in their preparation. Thanks to DJ’s help and continuous support, he gave me concrete steps and actionable items to focus on in order to gauge my improvement over time. His steps centered around going through E-GMAT’s structured course and drilling hard on quizzes using Scholarium. He also gave me reassurance throughout the entire process; I felt confident with what I was doing and had a clear idea on how to spend my time studying.

DJ made it clear that I needed to focus on four elements to do well on the GMAT:
•	Learn the concepts
•	Continuously apply concepts through questions
•	Focus on mastering timing
•	Have confidence in your abilities

I retook a few months later and scored a 710. I plan on retaking the GMAT soon and working closely with DJ again to strengthen any existing gaps in my learning. DJ promised to see my goal through until I reached 730+ and I am confident that he will continue to provide reassurance towards my success. We are now working towards that retake plan by communicating weekly and tracking my progress.

E-GMAT worked for me because of several reasons. Firstly, Scholarium contains hundreds and hundreds of questions across both Quant and Verbal; there’s endless opportunities to practice and refine your skills. Likewise, you can select specific types of questions (Strengthen, Weaken, etc.) to focus on. Secondly, their platform also allows you to see your accuracy rate on question types. Finally, the mentorship program was super helpful. It was very personable and customized to my own needs and schedule. DJ seemed to genuinely care about my success on the GMAT and he made an effort to follow up with me on a weekly basis and commit to my 730+ score goal. I'm excited to continue working with him.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by post count","Points","Location","GMAT is an one of kind of a well structured exam that tests your analytical ability and exposes what you are weak at. There is no escape from same. And to excel you just need to raise the bar of your ability.
And in this journey, a right guidance and mentor could prove to be very effective and quick way to success.  Along with all this a right guidance and right approach could prove to be a life long asset that you gain in your GMAT preparation journey.

In my journey of 620 to 730 journey, EGMAT turned out to be the same. I purchased its GMAT online course and used same throughout my preparation. 

1. Its verbal section is amazing. And there is no match to this. It explains the things in such a layman terms that anyone can understand.

	Master comprehension course was one of turning point for me in regards to how I read sentences and understand them. It overhauled my approach towards reading. And no doubt it leveraged my reading and understanding ability.
	
	Sentence correction course has been structured in such a way without any grammatical jargons that even a layman can understand it. It just build your base from scratch and equip you to solve complex sentences with right approach. Its meaning based approach is unique to EGMAT, and same no doubt helps in eliminating wrong answers with 100% accuracy.
	
	In CR, Prethinking approach really gives you better insights and understanding of argument, and fasten your problem solving skill. It is much easier to eliminate wrong answers once you prethink about depths of your CR argument.
	
	RC approaches nonetheless was helpful in gaining better understanding of complex passages.
	
	So overall I will suggest, Verbal section is not just guide you in right way of solving GMAT questions, but also helps you in building abilities that are required in your preparation and way forward in your B-school journey.
	

2. Scholaranium is another nice platform that helps your to customize test as per your need. I have tried few other tutorial test platform but none of them match with EGMAT Scholaranium. 
Also its explanation and approach to problem solving stands out any other.

3. In my initial attempts, EGMAT team gave me insights about what I am lacking and where I am making mistake with help of ESR. And those insights helped me to move way up the ladder. This platform do have very effective and responsive forum for Q&A.


So overall I will anytime recommend this course, incase your want to crack the GMAT fast and raise your analytical and ability skills.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","e-GMAT as a whole is phenomenal to say the least.

I signed up for the e-GMAT Verbal Online course after 3 failed attempts and specially when my score had dropped from GMAT #2:690 Q50 V34 to GMAT #3:650 Q50 V28!!! One of my seniors from undergrad recommended me this course.

Before my third attempt, I thought that my preparation was rock solid and that I would smash the GMAT with a 740+ score easily (since I was getting in the mocks). But after downloading the ESR and getting it reviewed by the eGMAT instructors, I came to know that I had big structural gaps when it came to concepts. 

The e-GMAT's Master Comprehension is such a good thing to learn. It helped me not just with Sentence Correction, but also with understanding complex CR arguments. I definitely recommend everyone to follow the process very closely and strictly. Then came the meaning-based approach to solving Sentence Correction questions and I cannot overstate the fact that how much this actually changed my mind.

I would highly recommend their Verbal course if you're a non-native speaker who's struggling with sentence correction. I improved my ability considerably with the course, and started scoring good in the mocks with my newly increased accuracy. My GMAT #4 went considerably better with a Q50 V38 but just a 710, which was quite low for this breakdown. And during the test itself I felt that this is not my ideal attempt - I experienced short mind blocks.

Nevertheless, I approached eGMAT support again, even though it had been 2 months since my course expired, and sent them my ESR. Dhananjay Lowe (DJ) picked me up from there and scheduled a call with me wherein he provided me a deep analysis of my performance and identified exactly what the issue was: A weak RC ability coupled with incorrect answers to my first RC passage, which had a very low difficulty level. I was amazed by how many insights DJ could draw out of the ESR.

I just listened to Dhananjay's advice and reappeared for the GMAT#5 and scored a super 750: Q49 V41. Notably, I got a 99%ile in SC with not even a single incorrect answer - this itself speaks for how good their Verbal online course is.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Getting a 640 after four months of preparation left me disheartened. I had no idea what to do, but I chose not to give up. After reading several reviews online, I enrolled myself in the e-GMAT course online. One of the lessons I realized was that I was never consistent with my approach while solving confusion that made me confused, and I was unable to comprehend what the question was asking. 

I built up a study plan with e-GMAT, started with quant, and then proceeded with verbal. In quant, I used to make very silly errors that were more of process gaps than conceptual gaps. The new e-GMAT quant course is hands down the best course to study the quant section. With a defined structure, you can easily navigate through the course without getting bored. In my last week, I just went through the process skills files to make myself confident in each sub-section. For verbal, there’s no better tool than scholaranium to make you better at verbal and applying the skills taught in the concept files. The pre-thinking approach for each question in SC/CR/RC is essential to ace the GMAT. I realized that you need to be consistent with your strategy, and you need to effectively dissect the question before looking at the answer choices. 

One piece of advice would be not to try too many questions. It’s okay if you do ten questions right in a day instead of practicing 100 questions in a day and exhausting yourself. I did that, and when I saw that my approach was not consistent, I needed to go through the concept files again and revise my strategy. However, till then, I had no questions left to apply my revised approach. I approached the e-GMAT support team and got in touch with one of their best mentors, DJ. He gave me a solid plan to follow weekly and made me do many custom-ability quizzes. The quizzes made me more confident, and I was ready to take one last mock I had left. But, after months of preparation, I got a 650 in the last e-GMAT mock, and I had no idea what to do. However, DJ was always there at every step of the journey and motivated me not to give up. I revised my concept files, made sure my approach was consistent with every question that I solved, and I saw a remarkable difference in my performance. 

Having exhausted my e-GMAT mocks and official mocks, I decided to register myself for the exam. I booked the online GMAT exam. I got stuck on a few questions in the quant section, and I didn’t let go of the questions that I should have, and I was running behind time before I even knew. I had 6 mins remaining for the last six questions. I got nervous, panicked, and screwed up my exam. I got a 640 again, but I knew that my ability is much more, and I will not settle myself at this score. DJ came up with a retake plan and made me understand how important it is to let go of the feeling of getting every question right on the GMAT exam. I decided to give as many mocks as possible and see where I was going wrong. I realized I did not apply my learning from the e-GMAT course while I was giving the exam. I took the veritas prep mocks and manhattan prep mocks, and my scores fluctuated between 680-700. Feeling confident enough, I booked the GMAT exam again. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a 700 (Q47, V38) on the screen. Finally, after months of preparation, my handwork paid off, and I can give the entire credit to the e-GMAT course and its effective strategy. For someone like me who’s never suffered academically but has been out of touch from studies for a while, I needed a comprehensive plan that keeps me motivated to study, and the e-GMAT course plan provided just that. On top of it, getting a mentor like DJ who was always there to guide me in the right direction is what I need to excel in the exam.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=83#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I finally got a 700 in my GMAT today ( Q50 , V34) .
I wanted to take the opportunity to share my journey here to help all students who are perhaps confused among the many sources available for preparation.
I started my journey with e-GMAT sometime back and my first GMAT Prep Official mock was 560 (Q45,V22). Given an engineering background i was confident of being able to do well in Quant if i brush up on some concepts, however the Verbal score was very disappointing. Here i would like to share that even though i am a non native speaker, my medium of study has always been English - thus a V22 was shocking.
My friend recommended e-GMAT to me for improving my Verbal. Here i would like to highlight that the course is very structured with a focus on 3 stages of learning - Building a strong foundation , cementing methods learnt,  Gauging the Ability through custom quizzes and full length tests. The entire Verbal course focusses on meaning based approach , which is the key to getting higher scores. 
The verbal course helped me improve my point by 8 and My first GMAT attempt was at 620 ( Q43, V31). I would like to highlight here that i did not focus on Quant much except solving OG questions. While i did well in the OG questions, the actual GMAT quant was much tougher especially if you are aiming at scores above Q48. I came back and wrote to the support team in E-GMAT. Within a few hours , i got a response from them - with an analysis of my account and requesting an ESR. I did provide the ESR and again within a few hours - i got a full analysis of my ESR, where i might be going wrong and what i should be doing to improve my scores. Again a very step by step approach was suggested - with major emphasis on doing the QUANT 2.0 course.
This course is a game changer ! The structure of the course again is on the 3 stages of learning - however they very interestingly have divided the modules such that you first give a Diagnostic test ( by topic) to gauge your understanding on the topic - then you have concepts, practice tests and then GMAT level question practice. Each module has been designed the same way and in the end you are recommended to go back and do the diagnostic test.
That in itself is a proof because you immediately would see your scores increasing. 
Given that I was working full time , i was looking for something structured, on point and with best ROI of my time and Quant 2.0 course of eGMAT was exactly that. I would highly recommend this to professionals as it would help you reduce your prep time significantly. One more interesting feature of the course is that you have video solutions for everything and you can adjust the speed of watching the video :) 
Post the course , cementing and practicing questions - the actual GMAT test seemed much simpler and the evidence is the Q50 i scored. 
I also would like to highlight the role of the support team here - DJ, Ashutosh, Nava - the response time as well as the willingness to help is really commendable. They do care for every student's score, career and time as if it was their own . 
Highly recommend the course !
Good luck on your GMAT journey","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=84#","1","0","","","","","",""

These words above are in brief the story of my GMAT journey which spans across 3.5+ years and 5 attempts (excl. one failed GMAT online attempt).

Disappointed after getting another sub-par score in Aug 2020, I spoke to an e-GMAT mentor and enrolled for both verbal and quant course i.e. e-GMAT online course.

On my enrollment, I was advised to take a mock to understand my level of understanding from previous attempts. Based on the score in mock, I was enrolled to a mentorship program. At the time of buying the course I was not aware of any such program and didn't realize how important it will be for my preparation. This mentorship program and the scholaranium were the key factors for my 160 point score improvement and 20 point improvement in verbal section. 

The mentorship program provided the customized touch for the students and encouraged students to perform better with right strategy and focus. This human touch to the prep was what I needed after 4 failed attempts. I worked with Dhananjay (DJ) during my preparation and he was the constant motivator for me as he knew that I not high on confidence after failed attempts. He provided an initial strategy to go through the course. After I have gone through the content, I was provided a plan to build my ability through the ability quizzes. As I moved closed to my exam date, DJ provided a 15 day exam readiness plan to prepare me for the exam day. This exam readiness plan helped me work on my timing strategy that I used during the exam. DJ was very reachable during the entire course and helped me achieve my target score.

Scholaranium provided insights into the type of questions that I was  getting wrong. This data driven approach helped me identify gaps in my preparation and guided me to concepts or process that I needed to revise or needed to get polished to it right in exam.

In terms of content of the course, verbal course is one of the best that I came across during my preparation. The focus on getting the process right for solving each type of question led me to use a structured approach (3 stage process) for each question. This provided clarity during the exam as I was not left on my own to find the right approach and also led me to reduce the time required to solve each question. Moving on to the quant course, it is one of the most comprehensive course. It covered all concepts that are tested on GMAT. The course is structured in such a way to develop a good memory of concepts on topics such as number properties or geometry. The quant course pushed my quant score from 49 to 50.

I will be happy to address any further queries. Please drop a message on LinkedIn.

I ended up doing well on quant which was my weaker area. I faced difficulty transitioning instantly from Quant to Verbal on GMAT online and also realised that I had a few gaps in concept and preparation.

I was really disappointed and frantically reached out to Dhananjay at E-gmat and explained my situation. He was really prompt and started by investigating my gaps in detail. He then gave me a thorough plan with daily tasks which included creating error logs, concept reviews and practice tests. I took my GMAT again in Feb and eventhough this time I unfortunately didn't do well at Quant, I got a V38. Dhananjay truly prepared me for the test itself not just from concept point of view but also for the test day itself. I realised test readiness is very crucial to excelling on the GMAT.

During my exam too I felt I wasn't perhaps doing as well as I thought because I thought some questions seemed easy but in the end all was well and the key to that was in the prep that Dhananjay put me through.

Although I am not at my ideal score, I know that I am not too far and realise what I could do better. I would also like to add that the E-gmat Quant 2.0 course is absolutely fantastic too. It truly challenges you and prepares you to face the tricky GMAT questions. E-gmat team really supports you every step of the way.

Finally, I would like to thank Rajat and the entire e-GMAT team for being personally invested in the success of the users on the platform and going beyond their duties to provide an amazing experience to them. This is something I cannot imagine any other platform every providing. If you wish to score well on the GMAT on the first attempt, do not think twice- e-GMAT is the way to go!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=84#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I had a 710 gmat score and i wanted to improve my score, so i signed up for egmat since it is marketed as the best online gmat course on gmatclub.

Below are my reviews on each section of the Egmat course.

Sentence Correction: I would rate it as average since there isn't anything extraordinary thing in this section. 

Critical reasoning: Average

RC: Poor. There are just few videos and RC passages in the course.

Quant: It is just a waste of time and money. If you follow the strategy that is taught in the course, you will be unable to solve any question on the test day in under 2 mins.

After studying for approx 5  months from egmat, I scored 700 that is 10 points less than my earlier attempt.

The best part of Egmat is its marketing team. Hats off to them. Other prep companies must learn from Egmat's marketing team.

At the time of sign up, Egmat team might offer you a discount of 50% on official mocks, but later they wouldn't hold onto that commitment.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=84#","5","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","When I decided to take on the GMAT, I knew nothing about GMAT Club or eGMAT. Most of my preparation was pretty much self-learning from the preparatory book I bought. I was not aware of many things such as the other methods of learning (if you are reading this review, that means you are aware of GMAT Club and eGMAT, that’s definitely a plus!), what scholarship scores looked like, what a Q** or V** actually meant for the overall score etc.

A few weeks after my speculative test (660; Q47, V34), I came across the GMAT Club (euraka moment) and discovered different ways of solving questions, learned what a >700 score looked like etc. About 4 weeks after discovering the GMAT Club world, I did the exam and had a 690 (Q47, V39). Because of other personal plans, I literally had 4-5 weeks to either do another test or stick to the 690 score. I had to do something different if I planned another test.

One day, I randomly saw a note about the free weekend eGMAT classes (another euraka moment) and attended a few of these. Then, I contacted eGMAT (spoke to Dhruv and then Dhananjay), and the hospitality was amazing. On my call with Dhananjay (DJ), I told him about my history with GMAT and my plans to take another test within 5 weeks of meeting him. DJ was very responsive and told me that my target score at the time (720) was achievable within that 4/5-week period if I diligently followed a personalized study plan which he sent to me. We also spoke about what I needed to do specifically in Quant and Verbal to achieve a 720 score, and in fact, what I needed to do in each sub-section of both sections to achieve that score. For the first time in my GMAT process, I had a tutor.

During this period, I was in constant communication with DJ, and 7 days leading to the test, we had another frank status conversation. At this point, he created a 7-day plan for me, and I was required to provide daily updates leading to the exam which I did. At this point, I had completely forgotten that I wanted a 720 score because I was aiming for much higher based on the progress made so far (my latest mock exam scores were between 710 and 760). So, I wrote the actual exam and had a 720 (Q49, V39) thankfully. I had mixed feelings though (I felt l could have done better, then I also realized I had made good progress over a short period). 

My takeaway is that the tutorship/mentorship process worked a lot for me. I made more progress in few weeks of this than in a few months of self-learning. The eGMAT portal is as diagnostic as it gets, and DJ was quite helpful in detailing what to exactly focus on. I asked myself ‘what if I had started this way a lot earlier?’. So again, if you are reading this at the beginning of your GMAT journey, you are in a very good space, trust me. I’ll recommend eGMAT for anyone who’s willing to put it in the effort to achieve his or her target scores.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=84#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT Prep early in Jan of 2020, I used to solve some questions here and there from the OG textbooks. After understanding the whole structure of GMAT and getting a 630 on a baseline mock test, I decided to look for a verbal course to help me do better on Verbal.
After a week of research on GMATClub and just general google searches, I decided to take a chance with the eGMAT free trial mainly due to 2 reasons; their GMAT Online package of Quant + Verbal was reasonably priced in comparison to other offerings on the market and they had the most number of reviews on GMATClub, that too highly rated. 
Within 2 days of starting the  7 day free trial, I was able to understand the value of the course. Not only was I learning new concepts in the Verbal section, I was learning new strategies and new ways to tackle Quant questions. This was eye opening and convinced me to take the full GMAT online course instead of just the Verbal. 
That was a great decision in hindsight since I enjoyed the Quant portion thoroughly and enjoyed learning new topics and getting challenged by the hard scholaranium questions. e-GMAT also helped me approach Verbal section with much more strategy and meaning based approach. Instead of just choosing the answer that sounds right, I was follwing the 3 step process, and pre thinking to get to the right answers. 
After finishing all the concepts I was able to judge my ability by taking ability quizzes on the scholaranium platform and also pinpoint my weaker areas with the quality analytics that the scholaranium platform provides. 
When I was done with all the concepts I used the Sigma-Mocks to test my preparation and was able to practice with real questions like the GMAT with the adaptive nature of the mocks. I ended up scoring the same on the GMAT as I did on my best mock - so it is pretty relaible. 

I would thank the e-GMAT team for making a great product, that I was able to use at any time I needed, and setting up great modules and lectures for test takers. A big part of my 90 point increase in 3 months is thanks to e-GMAT. I recommend it to everyone.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=84#","2","0","","","","","",""

I took my GMAT exam on 18th Feb 2021 and received a score of 660 (Q48, V33). I know this is not a great score but, I had reached a plateau of 610 and was not improving at all. My previous score was 610 (Q48, V25). I had an SC percentile score of 24. 

I took the e-GMAT course and worked hard on the sentence correction course. The result? I got a 79 percentile on SC. That's a huge improvement for me. I could have done a lot better if I had a little more time to finish the course.

It helped a lot to boost my levels but I found I could not get into the 700 region (which was my target).

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Location","e-GMAT's 'GMAT Online' offering is a great course to get you started with your GMAT Prep. Before purchasing this course, I had already explored a few other free offerings from other prep companies and was yet stuck at a score between 610-630 in mocks. After attending one of Rajat's RC webinars and applying the concepts in OG questions, I saw an increase in my accuracy. This prompted me to try out the free version of e-GMAT and I absolutely loved this limited version of the course. So much so that I decided to go ahead and try out the full-fledged version of GMAT Online after getting a decent discount 😊  

I started my preparation in June 2020 in the midst of the pandemic despite working 50+ hours a week. I landed a 570 in my first sigma mock. I reached out to the e-GMAT Support Team and requested them to help me with the next steps. The team created a customized study plan for me which I used until my first GMAT attempt in October 2020. Until a week prior to this attempt I was still scoring a 680 in sigma mocks. I was confident that I would be able to score somewhere in the vicinity of a 700. However, I got a 630 (Q48 V35) in my first GMAT (online) attempt. Upon performing a post-test analysis, I realized that my timing strategy for Verbal was not on point due to losing out time on harder RC questions. Post this attempt I again reached out to e-GMAT’s Strategy Team for help. I was suggested to follow a strict plan which involved using a mix of tools such as timed custom quizzes, strategic review of errors and GMAT Club mocks. By the end of November, I was scoring between 680-690 in both GMAT Club mocks and the GMAC Official mock. Thus, I decided to attempt the GMAT (Online) exam again in December. I secured a 680 (Q48 V35) in this attempt and this was a good enough score for me to apply to my target B-schools (I also secured admits to 2 of the 3 top IIMs in India with this score)

To summarize, I would highly recommend e-GMAT’s ‘GMAT Online’ course to those looking to build a solid foundation in both Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning. From GMAT Online’s Quant course, one can learn quite a lot of tips and tricks which can help solve even the hardest quant problems on the GMAT. Apart from the core content, the UI of the portal/application is very smooth and easy to use. If you are looking for a GMAT prep course with great customer support apart from great content, e-GMAT is what you should go for!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=85#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","This review is for e-GMAT's full online course priced at $349. I'm a native-born American and a working professional, out of school for 8 years and recently decided to switch careers to pursue MBA. It has been about 10 years since my last standardized test, and when I used to take tests, I usually scored very well without much study. So, I expected the GMAT to be like that.

To my surprise, no matter how hard I studied or how much time I put in, I could not break the low 700's barrier. I consistently scored 690-720 on various practice tests sampled from many GMAT courses. On Dec 8 2020, when I took the real GMAT, I scored a 710. I cancelled my scores (my target was 730) and decided right then that I needed the help of experts. 

I enrolled in e-GMAT and in a nutshell, I was overall extremely satisfied with the product they delivered. I adhered to a strict, daily study plan that they provided for 2 months, from Dec 13- Feb 13 culminating in a test on Feb 13, 2021. I scored a 760 V44/Q49, up from the 710 V38/Q49. I spent 6 weeks on Verbal and 2 weeks on Quant. If I had spent 2-3 more weeks on Quant with their material, I have no doubt I would have scored 50 or 51. The week before the test, I had only completed about 40% of the material and so had decided that improving Quant was too late for me. 

I want to make this review helpful to any native-born speakers who may be skeptical. e-GMAT may be, at first, difficult to get used to if you are an American, as the company is based in India and all the videos have speakers sporting an unashamed accent. But, if you stick with it and make no excuses for yourself, you will learn a lot. You do have to swallow your pride and realize you don't know much about English. I went from V38 to 44, and I could not have done it without learning the concepts and the processes provided by e-GMAT. 

I would attribute a big reason for my improvement to active participation in Scholaranium (their question and quiz bank). Although I wish they had more questions in the question bank (you can easily run out of questions and need to budget well), I believe they restrict the # of questions because of the importance of reviewing your past questions.

Never have I ever reviewed my own mistakes as in-depth as before. When I would review incorrect choices in the past, I would usually think ""ah, I was very close, I just won't be so careless next time!"" But e-GMAT stresses the importance of revision and to understand not only why you selected the wrong answer but also rejected the correct answer. Therefore, I started to understand the test-makers' thought processes and to spot subtle, detailed traps. 

I found myself frequently battling it out in their solutions forum, arguing why my solution was the correct choice. Sometimes, I would come across certain SC questions and think that the correct choice was so awkward... In the real world, native speakers would not think that this is a good English sentence! I would write passionately why e-GMAT's solution was wrong, or how the question/sentence was not clear or awkward. But always in the end, I would indignantly realize that the correct answer choice was slightly a better choice than mine, or that my thought process had logical gaps. 

I was lucky, half way through my study (around 40 days before the test) to have been enrolled in their Last Mile Push, where I was assigned a mentor (shoutout to Ashutosh) who would tell me what sections to study or what scores I needed to get on certain quizzes. This helped me not make excuses for myself (for example, if the target score was 70% and I got a 65% I would think that it was close enough. But my mentor would say that I failed and needed to redo that section). 

Last Mile Push also made me realize I was not studying enough, and to commit to 3 hours a day of studying and 6 hours a day on the weekends. This was the most insane amount of time I've dedicated to studying but I stuck with it. 

I did not take any of the SigmaX Mock tests (e-GMAT's practice tests) from Dec 13 until Jan 30, a full 6 weeks after I started my journey with e-GMAT. During this 2 week period before the real test, I took 3 different mocks, scoring 740, 700 and 720. It turns out that the Sigma Mock Tests are a lot harder than the real GMAT, as on test day, I found myself wondering why the test seemed so easy. 

The rest is history and I would like to say props to e-GMAT for sharing their process in such a clear, consistent and rigorous manner. Though sometimes it was not intuitive for me to know how to follow the study plan, their support stuff was always on standby to answer any questions or evaluate my results for me. 

Their newly revamped Quant course has a new style of teaching, boasting variety of activities. I would definitely say that it helped me solidify my number properties understanding. However, I did not spend enough time on their Quant section to give a detailed review, as I was still in the ""re-learning"" process of Quant when I took the test. 

Some quick cons to provide balance for this review: 
- the Personalized Study Plan recommended to me through AI was very inconsistent with the one recommended by my mentor. I was lucky to have had a bit more personal guidance on this.
- Scholaranium ran out of questions so I had to practice solving additional  questions using GMAT club forum
- the course is intensively concept and process-focused, and no test-taking skills or strategies are provided. If you enroll, be prepared to spend a lot of time to re-program your mind on verbal and quant concepts. You might do worse at first as you are assimilating a new process. For test taking strategies, I had to watch a few videos and read a few blog posts outside of eGMAT to learn some tricks for time management
- I couldn't finish the course in 2 months despite putting in 27 hours a week","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=85#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

2nd GMAT attempt: I was very disappointed with my score and took the test again one month later, still using Magoosh and  free material on the GMAC site, and scored 680 (Q47/V37).  I felt the online course I was using was not similar to the real test and I couldn't apply proper strategies to address different question types. So I decided to take a break  and take the test at a later stage. 

3rd GMAT attempt (using e-GMAT): In Sept 2020 I bought the e-GMAT online course and tried to focus on verbal, which was my weakest spot. I went through the SC course and most of CR, and I was impressed on how I was able to apply the e-GMAT process for solving these questions to improve my results in quizzes and mocks in the verbal section. The course is time consuming, but once you master their process you feel more comfortable with the questions & can asnwer them faster. I took the gmat again in Dec/20 and scored 700 (Q49/V37).  I was happy  to reach the 700-level but still felt that I could do better. 

4th (and last!) GMAT attempt: By the end of 2020 I was invited to join the Last Mile Push program with an e-GMAT tutor (Ashutosh) with the goal to score 720+. He provided me with daily tasks, overall focused on Quant, that allowed me to  increase the time studying & focus much better on taking the most out of the e-GMAT course. I did the new quant courses (Number Properties & Algebra) and I got much more comfortable with those type of questions. The course helps you build a strong foundation on the concept, learn process skills to solve different question types and then practice GMAT-style questions with more difficult level, similar to those you will take on the test. This 1-month program helped me to focus a lot on my preparation for the test. It still requires you to take the full course (which takes time) but again once you learn their process you get more comfortable with gmat-style questions. Finally, I scored 730 (Q48/V42) and very happy with the final result (especially in verbal that was my weakest spot since the beginning). 

I'd like to congratulate e-GMAT for creating such an excellent methodology to help test-takers excel on the GMAT and hope that you continue improving the course to help more and more people over time!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=85#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Studied for a month (about 80 hours) based on free resources, using weekend mocks to define each week study plan. Felt like I was running after my own tail, scores going down, feeling frustrated. Was probably missing the basics and how to best approach questions.

Decided on August 2nd to hire eGMAT, because all resources were already there and I could set my own pace.
I really liked the comprehensive way each content was organized and I could learn how to identify types of questions and how to best approach them. At first, it might seem you are dedicating much time on one thing, but it does pay off. I had rushed for a month and that did not help me at all.

I took a lot of notes and focused on what was most critical for me, because I had very few time (26 days between hiring eGMAT and test date). I really wish I had had the time to go through the whole content in the platform because it was an enjoyable experience and the more I studied the better my scores got. I stutied about 120 hours during second month.

Here is my track record

Mock 1 July 6th 600 (Q36, V36) - GMAT official (feeling ok)
Mock 2 July 10th 660 (Q44, V36) - Manhatan (feeling happy)
Mock 3 July 25th 660 (Q43,V37) - Manhatan (feeling worried)
Mock 4 August 2nd 620 (Q39, V35) - eGMAT (feeling terrible but still have some time) - this was the day I hired eGMAT
Mock 5 August 9th 620 (Q41, V34) - eGMAT (feeling I'm not gonna make it in time - 19 days before test)
Mock 6 August 16th 720 (Q45, V44) - GMAT official (feeling super happy but why wasnt this the real one)
Mock 7 August 23rd 680 (Q45, V38) -eGMAT (don't like the score but under the impression I do better in GMAT official tests than the courses')
Mock 8 August 26th 700 (Q40, V44) eGMAT
Real thing August 29th 730 (Q48, V 42)

																			by score report","","Location","I took the e-GMAT full course for a preparation time of around 45 days. Though the course is lengthy, there is a detailed explanation for each concept which is a must for initial preparation. There were questions for each difficulty level for each concept with application quizzes and scholaranium. 

But I felt that while going through the course and different questions, I got so used to the question types, that I was able to answer 90% of questions correctly by reading in one go. But the questions which we see in official guides and real-gmat are very different from what we see in e-gmat practice (language, style etc).  That's where it all becomes difficult.
There are surely certain deficiencies in the course : 
1) They say they are only a test prep company, but don't provide any prep material or guidance to prepare for AWA section.
2) The video quality for IR section was bad and unwanted background images.
3) The course can cement your concepts, but once you get used to it, all the scholaranium seems similar in Verbal (mostly SC, and CR section).
4) They count the total number of questions including OG questions but for OG only questions are available and not the options.
5) The approach which e-GMAT purports cannot be mastered in a small amount of time and once you try to apply that, it slows you down drastically, whereas GMAT is a test of speed and accuracy.
6) Once you buy the course, there is not much further support and if you ask for any help from support, they will blame you for nonsense.
7) Do not have summary files for anything except SC section.

So, on the whole, before taking the course I scored 700 and after taking the course I scored 700. 
I would recommend this course if your target is up to 700, but after that, I will say apart from this course please go through additional preparation to train your mind to change for GMAT style questions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=85#","1","0","","","","","",""

 I wanted a course that clarifies the basics to build a strong foundation, provides a good number of questions to test my abilities and provides expert guidance on doubts encountered. The e-GMAT course matched my expectations on all the above mentioned aspects. I sincerely recommend this course to other aspiring candidates and I can vouch for the course's credibility. 

I would like to highlight some of the key distinguishing factors of the e-GMAT course:

1. Concept Videos/Application Files : Great to build a strong foundation and to test ourselves. Both the Quant and Verbal concept videos are a boon to someone who wants to build on the concepts from scratch.
2. Scholaranium : A wealth of questions are available for timed/untimed practice. One can customize quizzes , vary the time limit and question difficulty level to test ability. 
3. SIGMA-X Mocks : One of the most robust Computer Adaptive mocks available online. The Analysis given after the mock is very useful as well.
4. Strategic Advisors : The Advisor who was assigned to me (Archit Bhargava) was extremely helpful and encouraging. He helped analyze  my ESR and highlight the key areas that I needed to work on.

Additionally, the e-GMAT support mail is pretty active and one can actually reach out to the instructors  either via the support mail or via the ""Ask an Expert"" feature on the e-GMAT platform. 

Above all, e-GMAT was a smart investment that helped me reach my target score. Kudos to the team !

Although, being a native speaker I was confident in the Verbal section, I knew I had to do well in the Quant section so as to achieve my target score which I wasn't so confident about.  This is where E-Gmat mentorship program came to the rescue. 
eGMAT’s mentorship program is one of the best guidance techniques there is available, for sure.  My mentor, Dhananjay(DJ), has not only guided me throughout my improvement journey from a Q43 to a Q47  but has also ensured that I keep up with my prep and that I have all it takes to crack the exam.  

The hyper specific weekly milestones that Dhananjay(DJ) created for me gave me a very strong sense of direction and accomplishment each day knowing exactly what I had to do during the course of the day, giving me a true sense that I as moving forward on the right track. My mentor, would touch base with me at the end of each week to check up on the status of the milestones as well as calibrate for new goals and developments. He would keep a constant track of my progress in the course, discussing and eliminating any roadblocks that I would find by sending me videos detailing exactly where I was going wrong. Basically, Dhananjay helped me look for ways to keep moving forward in my journey with the GMAT, ensuring that I learnt what was needed in the best and most effective way possible. 
Overall, it has been a great opportunity to learn in a truly personalized way. DJ has been a great mentor who has constantly motivated me to put in my best as well as made sure that he came up with solutions to avoid any impediments to my journey. The best part about having a mentor like Dhananjay(DJ) is that he is extremely approachable and I could reach out to him at any point of time with the smallest of queries or doubts and rest assured he would sort them out in no time

Also, a lot of credit goes to the e-GMAT 2.0 course, which is a substantial upgrade over its previous course files,  in my Quant score improvement. The best thing about Quant 2.0 is that it assesses your current skill level and then recommends next steps in order to avoid wasting time. I was able to enhance my learning in NP, Algebra and Geometry through the new quant course as the questions in the files were great and were at par with if not higher than the actual GMAT level and the process skill file made sure I was adept with the correct way of approaching and solving them. 

Looking forward, I aim to achieve a higher score and I now look forward to digging deeper into the Quant 2.0 materials along with the guidance of my mentor, Dhananjay and I am sure I will achieve my target score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=86#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","""I studied on my own for a month and got 760"" - after hearing my sister's GMAT debrief, I thought genes would work equally well for me and I would be able to ace this test without any external help. I thought, if not 1 month maybe 4 months would do and if not 760 a 730+ would do.

After preparing on my own through OG (+ Q & V Review) and MGMAT books for over 4 months, I was pretty confident that I was steering in the right direction. I did everything which a prudent GMAT aspirant would do - diligently practicing the OG, spending time on explanations, paying attention to timing, and giving several mocks (scored between 730-760 in all 6 official mocks, Expert's Global mocks, Princeton and Vertias mocks). After my first attempt in November 2020, I was shocked to see a 670 (Q49 V31). I knew that my verbal was weak but never did I expect (nor get in any mock) a V31. 

Heartbroken and disappointed, I booked another retest for the next available date, thinking that my concepts are strong but my luck was bad. I made a plan to practice harder this time, solve OG Advanced and also study for long hours so that my mind is under enough stress to perform well on the test day. 

Off-topic: I found out that my mind went into ""hot cognition"" during the exam and that is why I couldn't make sense of any verbal question. I just wasn't able to understand the meaning of any two sentences.

Anyway, I made sure that I have a disciplined routine and that I follow Mohammad Ali's advice on ""not quitting when you're tired"". 

I was on practicing on GMAT Club when I found out that I did not know much about ""-ing modifiers"" in SC. I read a beautiful explanation by Payal Tandon from e-GMAT. I had heard the name of this company a lot of times (read both positive and negative reviews - which is why I never opted for it earlier). After reading the explanation I went to E-GMAT's website and signed up for a free trial to understand more about modifiers. I felt that the way their videos explain things and the way they make you practice every little thing in various phases might just work for a student like me.

I booked a video call with one of the E-GMAT representatives (Dhruv) the next day and I explained to him my ordeal. I also showed him my ESR which clearly indicated that RC and CR were super weak in verbal. He explained a few things and suggested trying the E-GMAT course and extending my exam date because he felt I wasn't ready.

I was torn between spending on the E-GMAT course and applying the same strategy which I have been applying. I thought to myself - if I do the same thing again and again, I cannot expect the same result. After sleeping over it, I made up my mind to purchase the Quant and Verbal GMAT Online course.

After spending considerable time and energy on this course, I can tell you the exact pros and cons of this course so that you can make a decision based on what fits your bill:

Pros:

1. Dhananjay Lowe's mentorship. 

Excellent mentor. Helped me out with the most important strategy questions like timing, plateau, etc. He has experience of dealing with all kinds of students and you're probably one of the types - so he will know how to steer you in the right direction. He will also not hesitate to tell you that you have conceptual gaps even when you think you are good with concepts (and mostly he was right). 

Before enrolling I was skeptical about one thing - E-GMAT does not give phone numbers or do video calls for students when they have conceptual or strategy doubts. How am I going to work with that? But I was pleasantly surprised to see that their email system works quite well. DJ himself used to reply within 1-2 days whenever I had any issues. I remember the biggest help he gave was regarding my timing improvement on CR (brought down from 3 mins to 1.5 mins).

2. Their 3 Stage learning approach

At first, I thought this is just a marketing gimmick (just to show that they do have some system in place). But when I ardently followed the preparation through all stages, I realized that it's very methodical and reasoned. Basically, they will first assess what stage of learning you are currently on (for each subsection in V & Q) and then they will ask you to start from the appropriate stage. For example, I did not need to start with Stage 1 (learning concepts) in most Q subsections because I was doing well with concepts. 

3. Verbal course

It's one of the best. No doubts. I've tried almost every other course but their verbal course is the best thing ever. 

4. New Quant course

Their new quant course is much better than their previous one. Earlier their course was not as good as their verbal course but the new course is promising. Especially the ""Process Skills"", ""GMAT Skills"" and ""Application"" files are fantastic.

Cons:

1. Old Quant Course

Their old quant course was a bit too tough to comprehend easily. Also, it had certain topics that were stressed more than required. I am comparing because they gave me an upgrade to the new course between my preparation.

2. Difficulty of Q in mocks

Their SIGMA-X mocks are although fantastic when it comes to measuring your subsectional abilities and finding out your weak area if I were you, I would not take their Quant score in their mocks by heart. In each mock, I scored ~Q45 although I knew I was hovering around Q49. 

Finally, the exam day came (I even fell sick 3 days before the exam and thought that this is the end of the world). I got boosted on some coffee this time (I love coffee but I didn’t have it in my first attempt). I made sure I did some warm-up questions 1 hour before the exam. 

Verbal seemed better this time. Quant was the same (easy in the beginning but a tad bit difficult towards the end). I wasn’t expecting more than 740 but I think my effort and stars were aligned on that day - I got a 750 (Q49 V44).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=86#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","Let's talk about e-GMAT's practice to allure prospective students into buying their packages.
They have a lecture for QR where they will assess your level and then recommend you a path you should follow to improve. In that lecture, the standard of questions used is so far from actual questions that appear on GMAT exams that that exam can never be a fine predictor of where you're at. The questions in e-GMAT's test are purposefully constructed to waste your time, making it absolutely difficult for students to write that exam well and in time. Well, even if I'm wrong about the malice in their intent, that exam would mean that e-GMAT absolutely incompetent in predicting what kind of help a student needs. Anyway, the result is that students feel knackered, and end up purchasing their online course. This is what exactly happened with me at least.

Even their sigma-X mock exams follow a similar pattern. Their SC questions only try to increase the difficulty level by increasing the length of almost every SC question, a situation that would never occur on real GMAT exam.

My point is, e-GMAT's course is so far away from what would appear on a real GMAT that it can't be a great estimation of your score, and their course can't take a student in the right direction. My scores in Sigma-X under standard conditions were 610 and 580.

One final point, a nonnative who has studied courses throughout their life in English should never purchase their study materials to prepare for Verbal. The reading comprehension course does nothing to add to abilities of such students.

Someone might argue that I got a 610 in sigma-X and 610 on real GMAT. I could talk at length on why I failed miserably in my first GMAT attempt, but in nut-shell, it had nothing to do with e-GMAT. I did fairly well in my second attempt, and it definitely did not have anything to do with e-GMAT. I simply left using their materials after assessing the quality of their questions.

Their course is not reflective of reality, so take anything they advertise with a grain of salt.


If you see this e-GMAT, please don't write that I did not complete your modules to actually benefit from them, just like you respond to other negative reviews. I was in a good position to assess that your courses were not taking me anywhere in my GMAT saga.
And I agree I'm venting out my frustration because I feel this is the worst way I could have spent $299.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=86#","3","0","","","","","",""

A diagnostic test at the beginning of each module ensures that one is only addressing problem areas without wasting time on already strong sections.

Although I was confident in the Quant and RC section, I knew I had to score well in SC and CR as well to achieve my target score of 720+. I started researching about verbal courses through the internet and interacting with friends/seniors. This is where E-Gmat came into the picture. 

I must say that the course content and the method of teaching has exceeded my expectations. The course has been designed elegantly with a perfect mix of concepts, theory, examples, application, and tests. The best thing is that they never tell you to mug up rules, instead, they will tell you how to answer questions through logic and meaning. This approach assisted me a lot while attempting tricky questions. Also, the pre-thinking approach in CR helped me develop an overall thought process by which I could eliminate 2-3 options directly. The scholaranium, with its vast question pool and analytics system, helped me to improve on my timing while attempting the questions and enabled me to identify and learn from my mistakes. The instructors were quick to respond to questions, although I just sent them a couple of them as most of my questions were already answered in the inbuilt forum.

I would firmly recommend E-GMAT verbal course to anyone who's looking for improving their score in the verbal section.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=86#","0","0","","","","","",""

The second thing is the mock tests and the detailed analysis that we get after them, this really helps knowing where exactly we went wrong and what are the weak topics of each section, understanding these can considerably help save time in preparation.

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Location","I started preparing for GMAT 2.5 months back. With a full-time job, I used to find 2 hours a day on weekdays and 4-5 hrs on weekends for test preparation. I started by taking a diagnostic test by Manhattan Prep in which I scored 640. I completed OG verbal and quant first and then gave another Manhattan Prep test in which I again scored a 640. I realised that there were gaps in my preparation and I needed to get a strong hold on fundamental concepts first. I used the study materials available on GMAT club for all Quant and Verbal topics and made notes on all the concepts. I found Manhattan GMAT study material quite helpful for verbal. For quant, I focussed on solving more and more questions and building my approach by reviewing solutions. And this is where my Quant strategy did not improve at all!

I gave the Free Sigma Mock Test available on EGMAT and found myself scoring a 43 on Quant and a 43 on verbal. After weeks of practice, this score led me to seek support in understanding gaps in my preparation. I reached out to Dhananjay Lowe, an expert with EGMAT. He helped me analyze my Sigma Mock Test and devised a preparation strategy that could cement my work thus far. My exam was exactly a month away. And how EGMAT works is that they analyze your latest mock (only MBA.com mocks or Sigma Mocks btw!) and highlight gap areas to you. In my case, my preparation was at varying stages in different topics. For e.g., I needed a stage 1 (conceptual and process skill development) training in Algebra and Geometry whereas Stage 2 (Cementing Quizzes) in NP, Word Problems and Advanced topics. Similarly in verbal, I needed to go through Stage 1 again (Concepts and Process development) in CR and Stage 2 in RC and SC.

What is amazing about EGMAT is that it is very logical and structural in approach. It won't let you leave things to chance. Payal's videos on Quant helped me improve my techniques drastically. After practicing quizzes in concept files and scholaranium, my confidence went up a lot and I found my test anxiety also going away.

If I were to do it all over again, I would honestly start my preparations with EGMAT (not an exaggeration). They help you save time, get your approach right and get a strong grasp on fundamentals.

Oh, and please don't forget to check out their new Quant course. The section on ""GMAT skills"" is amazing! If you take that up, you are going to seal a great score.

I do feel that if I had more time in hand, my preparations given all the study material and quizzes available on EGMAT could have been better and I would have gotten Q50 on the D-Day which I really hoped for. :-P

																			by score report","","Location","I discovered e-gmat through GMAT Club.

During April 2020, I took about 7-8 free tests (2 tests every weekend) from various portals and scored between 580-640. Then I decided that if I wanted to improve my score, I needed to get serious and commit my time for a solid preparation. After using the free trial from e-gmat for about a month, I registered for its full online course during the first week of May 2020.

Meanwhile, I had been reading/watching several success and failure stories on the GMAT Club’s forum. The last time I gave any “competitive exam” was over 10 years ago and I was running low on confidence and high on insecurity of failing to score above 700 in the first attempt. 

I studied about 3-5 hrs every day and completed the verbal and the quant section within 3 weeks.  On May 20, I took my second Sigma-Mock test and scored 740. I was happy with the progress and continued to practice questions in Scholaranium. However, after 2 weeks, I took the 3rd Sigma test and managed to score only 690.  This got me worried and for the first time I contacted e-gmat. They responded quickly and told me how to use Scholarinium efficiently for better results.

Ten days later, I gave the 4th test and scored 700. I had solved almost all the questions in Scholarinium and even after over a month of preparation, I felt stuck. I wrote to e-gmat again and they gave me the much-needed encouragement to keep practicing. They told me that if I could score 700 in their tests, I could comfortably score above 700 in the final exam. 

I realized that I was good with my concepts but I would usually experience a fatigue midway during the verbal section. The first time I scored 740 in the practice test, I answered the Verbal section first and then Quant. But because of the new rules of GMAT Online, I had to take Quant first and then Verbal. This resulted in me making mistakes in the Verbal section. Sometimes, I would mess up SC and then sometimes CR. I needed something to do to improve my consistency. 

6 weeks into the preparation, I started solving GMAT OG questions through e-gmat. I felt that I needed more practice sitting for 3 hrs and giving the exam in one go. So, I bought a 7-test package from Veritas and 4 tests from official GMAT website. For the next 2 weeks, I took practice tests almost every day. Though my results did not improve a lot, since the score moved between 690-730, it definitely improved my test taking stamina.

Finally, I gave my final Sigma mock test on June 22 and scored 760. After 7-8 weeks of preparation and taking over 25 practice tests, I felt I was ready and booked the exam on 2nd July. 

Everything was going well but when the examiner was about to release the exam, my laptop screen froze. I got a call from GMAT but my phone was in the other room and I couldn’t receive it. I restarted my laptop and did the whole verification process again. Finally, after 20 mins delay, I started the exam. I was really pissed at my luck and was definitely not in an “ideal” state to give the exam. But somehow, all my practice paid off. All I remember is that I had a sharp focus and I was in “the zone”. I finished the exam but I was so focused that I didn’t realize if it went good or bad. I felt that I gave my best and was satisfied with the effort.

After 19 days of delay, I received the score in the morning. During the whole preparation phase, my target was 740 and sometimes I would dare and dream of scoring 760. But when I saw 770 on the screen, it was something unexpected. I thanked God and went out for a morning walk. 

I would like to thank e-gmat for their support and their excellent study material. I was good in Quant but e-gmat made it possible for me to consistently score Q50 in the practice tests and the final exam. I was not too good with the Verbal section. I would score around V27-28 for the first month of my prep. I struggled with SC the most but e-gmat’s SC study material is amazing. After going through their material, I improved enough to love solving SC questions. CR was the hardest for me to improve. Even until the final exam, I was not feeling too good about CR. E-gmat talks about “pre-thinking” to solve CR questions, but honestly, it never clicked for me until the very end. 3-4 days before the final exam, I went through all the practice tests that I had taken and that is when it all came together. I started seeing a pattern with CR questions. I did not practice much for RC. Overall, e-gmat has an excellent collection of quality questions and if one takes time to practice all of them, I am confident that one can face GMAT questions better.

Once again, I would like to thank e-gmat and I would recommend e-gmat to anyone looking for a good preparation course. They have easy to understand study material and they make it very easy to follow your progress. They are quick to respond to your query. Once I did not agree with their solution for a CR question and I wrote them a little angry post about how their “pre-thinking” was kinda BS and it only worked if you already knew the answer (I guess I was not in a good mood after failing to get any right answers that evening). The last post on that question was made over a year ago and I was not expecting any reply to a rather rude post. But to my surprise and delight, I got a response the next day and it was very helpful. 

Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that GMAT is an interesting exam. It doesn’t take a lot of book-knowledge to score over 740. A few wrong answers can make a difference between a 770 and a 700. One needs to have complete focus and composure during the final exam and it can be achieved through honest practice and a little bit of faith.

Faith is a powerful tool that can get you through anything. Keep faith and trust God. 

This week I received the admission letter from my desired MS Finance program and I feel happy. I have much more to talk about but for now I will end here. Maybe next year when I start my studies, I will revisit this post and write about the importance of faith when preparing for GMAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=87#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","After spending 3 months completing a big-name prep company’s online course, I scored 660 (Q47 V35 IR6) in my first GMAT attempt. Disappointed but not disheartened, I knew I need to level up my game, but how? I remembered what Albert Einstein once said, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" I decided to find a new approach to GMAT preparation.
 
e-GMAT first caught my eyes through its helpful articles and thoughtful solutions posted on the GMAT Club. After signing up, I was impressed by two things:
【1.	Its systematic problem-solving approach, which is thoroughly explained in its engaging video content】 
Right off the bat, the Master Comprehension course taught me how to read and understand GMAT passages more effectively, a foundation necessary to succeed in not only RC, but also SC and RC. Its meaning-based SC approach was a game changer for me: I’m no longer held hostage by countless grammar rules and obscure idioms—meaning-based approach did wonders for me, allowing me to achieve a 96%ile score in the SC sub-section (as per the ESR of my second GMAT attempt, in which I got a 720). RC was my weakest spot, but e-GMAT’s pre-thinking helped me gain the clarity of mind needed to excel in seemly convoluted questions, achieving an 88%ile score in the RC sub-section.
【2.	Its data-driven exam prep process, which is embedded in each element of its course】 
From working with machine learning (ML) models at work, I came to appreciate the beautiful God-given human brain and its powerful neural networks that can brilliantly learn, an ability that distinguishes us from other species. A ML model’s job is to teach a machine to discern patterns in a massive amount of data; however, not all ML algorithms are created equal—some are more effective than others in generalizing (i.e., predicting/scoring with new data). The best algorithms tend to be the ones that have rapid “feedback loops” to help the models incrementally improve. 
Rapid feedback loops and incremental improvement are exactly what e-GMAT team has built. From the quizzes integrated in lectures, Scholaranium practice platform, and analytics-packed Sigma-X Mock Exams, e-GMAT provides tremendous amount of quantitative feedback to help learners know how well they are internalizing the concepts, so they can improve before moving onto another sub-section or concept. If this is not a beautifully efficient learning process, what is?

After relearning GMAT with e-GMAT for 3 months and one week before my 2nd attempt, I got an email saying I was selected to partake in the e-GMAT Mentorship Program (still a myth to me how they select students to join this unadvertised program? Does anyone know? I’m curious.). Although I got the invitation one week before my exam, I figured to give it a try since it’s a complimentary service. I thought there isn’t much I could do at this point, but my mentor, DJ, proved me wrong. 

Although working from a different time zone and already had a packed calendar, DJ went out of his way to meet with me outside his normal working hours. He thoroughly analyzed my mock exam results and provided me with a 4-day game plan with daily action items, which was designed to help me strengthen my weak areas (timing and knowledge gaps in certain sub-sections). DJ’s encouragement also provided me with a boost of confidence before I stepped into the testing center.

Four days later, I scored 720 (Q47 V42 IR4) on 12/3, a big improvement from my previous 660 received on 7/14, but I know I could do better as I’ve scored 740 & 750 in my recent mock exams. I shared with DJ that I hope to give it another shot to achieve my full potential. DJ gladly offered to analyze my ESR and create a 2-week game plan to help me achieve my goal. 

I’m grateful to have received help from e-GMAT experts such as DJ. I'm excited and looking forward to meeting him on Sunday to go over his assessment and my 15-day plan. Onward and forward—the journey continues.


【12/23/2020 Update】 I gave GMAT another shot early this week and felt very grateful to have received a 740 (Q49 V41 IR8) this time. In the last two weeks of my prep, I did three things in e-GMAT that really helped:
1)	e-GMAT’s Scholaranium custom quizzes (daily) and Sigma-X Mock Exams (2) to practice applying concepts on a timely manner;
2)	e-GMAT’s Quant 2.0 (https://e-gmat.com/blogs/gmat-quant-preparation/), a new course recently released. Although only had time to complete ¾ of the new Number Property module, I really liked it. I appreciated how each concept in the module starts with a diagnostic quiz, result of which is used to recommend a learning path unique to the student. Additionally, I was very happy to see that the process skills, such as Consider All Cases and Apply Constraints, are being explicitly taught and tested in the new Quant 2.0 course. e-GMAT's structured approach helped me to make a significant breakthrough in Verbal, so I wish I had access to this new course since Day 1—I probably would have scored higher in Quant.
3)	e-GMAT’s IR module, an area I didn’t pay much attention last time, so I quickly went over the key lessons to learn the more efficient process to tackle IR questions.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=87#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Instructor","I got in touch with DJ towards the end of November, just under a month back. Since then, my GMAT journey has drastically changed (for the better). DJ has been by my side, answering any questions I had. Obviously, regarding content you can always write the GMAT support team, but it was very useful to have someone who could answer any overhauling or general questions which might pop-up when preparing for the GMAT. 

After getting a very specific analysis of my first SIGma-X mock (700, Q49, V36), DJ recommended I follow the SC course, which would create a good base for increasing my Verbal score. Upon completing this course I felt a lot more confident answering Verbal questions, it started to become a second nature to me, but noticed that I still had quite some conceptual gaps in the Quant section after taking multiple cementing quizzes. Fortunately, the new Quant course was just published and I was lucky enough to be one of the first to test it. With less than a week to go before my GMAT, I managed to (very efficiently) improve certain conceptual gaps, though due to time constraints didn't manage to go through the entire course. DJ mentored me very carefully throughout the last few days of preparation, which helped me to really get the most out of my time. This included a very specific video-analysis of my most recent mock test which pinpointed the lowest hanging fruits as well as coming with a step-by-step plan for the last 3 days. Unfortunately, my actual GMAT (Online) test didn't go as good as I hoped it would, because of the Quant section (Q42). Nevertheless, I'm really happy with my increase in Verbal (V36 -> V41 within a few weeks). I'm looking forward to taking the new Quant course over the next few weeks and giving the GMAT another shot soon thereafter. 

I'd like to thank DJ for his extensive mentoring and look forward to working together towards a 720+ score over the next month!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=87#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Needless to mention, I was already aware of the great work e-gmat had been doing, because I had attended a few of their webinars, and found them very conducive. 
The numero uno step was to deduce the right strategy. Because I was already at a 730, getting into the top 1 percent required me to be cognizant of my exact strengths and weaknesses. One call with the e-GMAT GMAT strategist and I was all set. The sigma-x mocks do a wonderful job in simulating the exact areas where you lagged behind, the areas where you spent more amount of time than you should have. And all of these analytics helped me form a base plan to achieve a minimum of 20 point increase in my score within 30 days.
The concept files of Quant and Verbal are amazing, extremely detailed and helped me identify the areas where I wasn't sure of my concepts. The scholaranium is huge, vast and has a number of filters that delve deep into sub-sections and difficulty levels, and allows us to practise exactly the problems that we significantly are weak at. Doubt clearances are all round the clock, and the solutions are extremely detailed.
Overall, the best value for money, and I highly recommend the course to every test taker who wishes to ace the GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=87#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I cannot thank the E-GMAT team enough for the amount of improvement I made on the Verbal section of GMAT between my 2 attempts.

For my first attempt, I went ahead with a reputed live online coaching program in India. Although, my quant prep was decent, I was struggling badly in verbal. SC, which is by far the easiest section on GMAT verbal, was pulling my score down badly. A month before my first GMAT attempt, I came across e-GMAT's verbal course and took a free sigma mock to gauge my preparation and scored a V26. On the subsequent official test 1 attempt (2 days later), I scored a V33. I thought that the sigma mock was not an actual representation of GMAT verbal section. I trusted my preparation, studied for a month and went ahead with the actual exam, only to receive a reality check (Actual score – 630 – Q49, V27). I realized that the verbal section is the one which is going to make or break my score. I got in touch with Sandeep from e-GMAT and immediately took up its subscription.  

The SC, CR and RC modules of e-GMAT course are so designed that their focus lies entirely on mastering a structured process. Trust me, this is the only way to consistently perform and succeed on the GMAT. If you learn to follow a structured approach for any question, nothing will stop you on the D-Day.

The online practice platform – Scholaranium is the best that one can ask for. It helped me identify the gaps in my preparation and I could track my progress on it with ease. 

The e-GMAT support staff is great too. They are readily available to handle you doubts over a mail and their response time is less than 24 hours. They also paused my subscription when I needed that owing to work commitments. 

All in all, e-GMAT verbal online course is your best bet if you are looking for a great verbal score or are struggling with your verbal preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=88#","0","0","","","","","",""

I learned about a pre-thinking, a real game-changer and was able to solve 700+ questions. I was seduced and decided to buy the course. 
SC was my strongest subsection, i started at the 66th percentile, but i needed a more focused approach, not splits. As a non native speaker, i was able to improve to the 96th percentile on SC on exam day, by using the meaning approach, another competitive advantage of e-GMAT.
My final results were V40 Q48.

I had used other methods for preparation on both these attempts. In my third attempt I decided to use the e-gmat course as it was suggested to me by my colleagues.
The egmat course was very helpful in securing a decent score. The verbal section was excellent; it provided specific methods to attempt different sections. My weak point was CR, and the pre thinking method really helped me crack it. Apart from this, schoranium from egmat had gmat like questions that were really challenging and helped with my overall thought process.
For quants, more than the questions that egmat had, it was the free access that they provided for the gmat club tests that was instrumental in me achieving Q49. Scholaranium questions seemed a bit tougher and solving them equipped me with a calmer mindset while solving actual gmat questions.
Lastly the five mock tests were really helpful in estimating my level of preparedness. The score that I got from the mock test was what I got in the actual GMAT tests.
I strongly recommend taking the egmat course especially if you are a non native english speaker looking to improve verbal as the methods are easily understandable and the quizzes will help you put them into practice.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=88#","0","0","","","","","",""

The Sigma-X mocks gave a clearer idea of my strengths and weaknesses. I scored 640 (Q50, V28). I decided to buy the verbal+quant package (which cost me around $350). Since my Quant scores were consistently in the 49-51 range, I allocated more time to Verbal. I completed the theory from in the eGMAT modules, which was interspersed with application quizzes. As completed each subsection (order being RC, CR, SC), I gave some ability and custom quizzes with 700+ questions to hone these skills. I gave two more Sigma-X mocks and saw decent improvement (one after completing RC, one after CR). I completed all the quizzes in the Quant section and brushed up the theory only if I scored below 80th percentile in that topic. These performance markers were great to judge my progress. The theory videos gave a clear and concise explanation with a focus on mastering the basics first. The various quizzes required me to perform repeated application of those concepts in order to gain speed.

I had completed all course material of e-GMAT, solved every question of OG, had completed and analysed multiple sectionals of GMAT Club and was scoring well in mocks. But just 11 days before my exam, I took a full length mock and made some serious blunders which could have been avoided. While wondering what I should do next, I reached out to the Support Team of e-GMAT and the very next day, fortunately, Dhanajay Lowe (DJ) got in touch with me and took the ownership of guiding me. 

The fact that just 10 days before the exam, a member from e-GMAT comes forward and says, ‘I’ll help you get there’ itself speaks a lot about the attitude e-GMAT has for its students. Within 24 hours, Dhananjay organised a call and curated a customized 10-day plan of action. He created video analysis of my mocks and other quizzes and actually guided me on using the e-GMAT platform in a planned and methodical way. When you say that the expert knows it all, they actually know much more than you can gauge. 

I have explored multiple course materials and quizzes online, but believe me, nothing will be able to match the content e-GMAT has on its platform. They help you customize your progress, give you a dashboard which reflects your strengths and weaknesses, create quizzes to sharpen your mettle and provide extensive explanations to every question. Though the strange fact is, you have everything in front of you but you are still oblivious of key factors that will define your score. This is where Dhananjay played the most important role in my last leg of the journey. He not only made me aware of my weaknesses but also gave me a plan of action to resolve the same. And yes, in 10 days, we saw great progress. The video analysis of my quizzes and the test readiness strategy worked wonders for me. The gruelling yet doable plan of action along with the constant feedback from Dhanajay, helped me gain confidence and put me on the right track.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hey people I'm Sushanth. 
I always thought that breaking the 700 score barrier on the GMAT wasn't something that I would be able to, but thankfully I was wrong.
As you people will notice in the details that I have mentioned as a part of this review, I had already given the GMAT once before taking up E-GMAT's Verbal Online course. I scored a 640 on my first attempt, way below what I had initially expected. The break-up was Q-48 and V-30 IR-2.
Post this, I wrote an e-mail to the E-GMAT team and decided to try their Verbal online course. A point that I was able to infer, was with respect to my performance in the critical reasoning and reading comp sections. I had performed pretty badly and hence decided to hone my verbal skills for the second attempt.  I scored 710 on the second attempt,
the breakup mentioned here:- Q-50 V-36 IR-5.

Now coming to the actual crux of the matter, the E-GMAT Verbal Online Course is actually pretty good. In fact, after reading lots of negative reviews online I decided not to go for it, but post the first attempt I figured I didn't have anything to lose. The course ended up being very detailed, interactive, and well designed. It has lots of inputs and details that are really useful. I didn't really use it for SC, as I was decent with that, but instead used it to work on CR and RC. The scholaranium is a nice place to test out your comprehension of the concepts. It is customizable and has really nice questions of varying difficulty. The cementing quizzes are pretty cool too.
All of the separate SC, CR, and RC sections have concept and application files, which are really well-designed. There are pre-quizzes and post-quizzes that help you assess your comprehension of the intended concept as well. 
Also, FYI I wrote the Online GMAT on my second attempt. (The Online GMAT is really nice, i.e. you don't have to go out and write the test in an environment you're not accustomed to.)
P.S.- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the GMAT, E-GMAT's Verbal Online Course,etc.

2) Theory / Modules: I also found the modules, practice and concept quizes quite useful they helped me build a good understanding of the subject and have a strucutred approach. Sentence correction was particularly useful. Also, the ability to refer back to the modules as and when needed further helped in my practise.
3) I think e-gmat is a very good course, good value for money and the e-gmat team is always quite supportive. After my first attempt their team personally evaluated my ESR and then provided me with a strategy to improve my score. Overall I recommend e-gmat course without any reservations.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=88#","0","0","","","","","",""

Not only is the course very well structured, but is also crafted precisely for GMAT. While my overall experience with the course was phenomenal, the Verbal section in particular exceeded my expectations. On top of that, the course has a very quick response time (within 24 hours) to any of your queries. The live sessions offer an ever better insight into the hurdles that the test makers throw at the test takers, further making the GMAT journey even simpler for its students.

1.eGMAT is different in the sense that it understands the process better than anyone else. It is difficult to excel in GMAT based on intuition, eGMAT builds a whole narrative to help you approach a problem. Right from how to read a sentence to help effectively attain a step by step process to actually arrive at the right answer and reject all others on the strong ground. 

2. eGMAT has done an excellent job in that their special scholarium portal not only focusses on the questions answered incorrectly but also why one spent those extra seconds even if they answered it correctly. It is a rigorous process that ultimately leads you to solve any question in a structured manner and eliminate the answer choices. 

3. The analytics is massive, you will know exactly where you need to focus and there will be a personalized email to follow these 2-3 steps to get a stronghold in your weaker sections.

4. The mock tests are beautiful. They are probably the closest to the actual GMAT. 

In all, it is a brilliant package especially for people who struggle in Verbal. eGMAT's Verbal Section, Scholarium, and the Mock test series are hands down the best in the businesses out there.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=88#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","You can't go wrong with e-GMAT. The course is comprehensive, the analysis tools are highly useful, and the questions are great at highlighting where your weaknesses lie when you get them wrong.

The quant course is pretty much perfect. It's comprehensive, has extensive material and practice questions on all relevant topics, and the difficulty levels are pretty much the same as those of the real GMAT. On top of that, the analysis tools time every question individually and collect data for average and benchmark times, so if you think you might have trouble with timing on the real GMAT, the quant course is perfect for you. I went from 44 (48%) to 50 (86%), and probably would have scored 51 if I hadn't misread a I II III question in a hurry (those questions are my bane, on one of my real GMAT attempts I identified the correct answer to be ""2 only"", but chose ""II only"" before remembering to check what those statements actually said).

The verbal course is very good. The only imperfection is that the writing style is a little bit different from the GMAT's, but that can be easily remedied by doing only official questions after you've learned all the material in the course and have about a week before your exam. I didn't actually improve my official score at all in verbal after having done the course, because I apparently screwed up a bunch of critical reasoning questions (the verbal question type I have the most performance variability with), but I nonetheless think the course is great for verbal because I was scoring 45 and 47 on 5 official practice tests before the real exam (4 of which I had done more than a month and a half before, 1 of which I had never done and then scored 47 on), whereas I had been scoring consistently less than 43 on all practice exams I took before taking the course.

If you're still unsure, do the free trial. The audio quality kind of sucked the when I did it, but the format suited me and the practice questions were very useful. The audio and the rest of the media in the real course turned out to be clean and sophisticated anyway, so don't worry about that.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=89#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

The EGMAT team also has been really supportive and instrumental in helping me achieve my target score.

Some of the pros of eGMAT community are 

There is a eGMAT forum available as part of the course. Its a discussion and doubt solving forum where eGMAT experts answer student queries. The eGMAT forum is the best place to get answers to all your doubts from silliest to the most intelligent ones. Shraddha who is an SC expert helped me immensely by diligently answering and resolving my doubts within a day. The eGMAT forum is a kind of a  gold mine with a great list of questions already, which has been asked by past eGMAT students. Many times, just going through the questions ,already asked, solves the doubt and gives an immense amount of knowledge around the question or concept. 

The eGMAT team is really supportive and responsive for any issue or problem one faces while preparing.  When I could not achieve my target score in my second attempt even after putting all the hard work I could, it was really disappointing and demoralizing. Sharang and Karan from the eGMAT team helped me analyze my ESR and assured  that I can achieve my target score if I followed the right strategy. They shared the story of Jim Yi , which really inspired me a lot. I followed what they said and I achieved my target score of 750 in the next attempt. 

During the course of preparation, the eGMAT team shared some videos from Rajat and Payal which has helped me a lot in creating the customized tests in the right way and analyzing my progress in Verbal ability along the way. Even though the package is online, the team is very approachable and responsive to all the student’s problems and doubts. They are really invested in the success of their students.

When I approached e-GMAT to help me with the study plan it asked me to take a mock to benchmark my level. I scored 640 on the mock and the folks at e-GMAT helped me identify areas of improvement. During one such discussion I was told that e-GMAT had a mentorship program and that if I was interested I could join one. I was introduced to Ashutosh and he was considerate enough to mentor me even though it had been a month since he started mentoring a batch and had no place for an extra person.

Few of the features of the mentorship plan:

1.	You are given a weekly plan detailing out what to study each day and how much time to spend on each. There were weekly check ins to gauge the progress. These really helped me stay focused and complete the assigned tasks as there was a sense of accomplishment
2.	The batch would catch on a fortnightly basis to discuss problems and help each other out. Ashutosh would help us with various strategies and help course correct when someone got astray
3.	Ashutosh was just a call away and he would always respond to calls/texts, no matter when I pinged him. He was really invested in my progress and helped me achieve what I did

The course content of e-GMAT is very well curated and covers everything one needs to ace the GMAT. Scholaranium is a wonderful tool to test your ability and track your progress. It has around a 1000 questions in each of Quant and Verbal and each GMAT question type is very well covered. Each question has a detailed solution/explanation and the best part is that it not only provides a detailed explanation for the correct answer choice, but also provides a detailed explanation for each wrong answer choice. One can post one’s queries on each and every question and get a detailed explanation within 24 hours. I am amazed by the level of commitment and knowledge each and every one at e-GMAT has. The analytics available helps you pinpoint your weak areas so that you could go back to the study material to improve.

Just today I was speaking to a colleague about GMAT and when he mentioned that SC was his weak area, I immediately recommended e-GMAT course to him. Such has been the impact e-GMAT had on my prep.

I highly recommend this course to all those who want to crack the GMAT. Right from the course content to the mentors and faculty, e-GMAT is a class apart.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=89#","0","0","","","","","",""

Coming from an engineering background, I was good at quant; However, Verbal remained my Achilles' heel, and I could only reach V29 in my five attempts that I took from 2017 to 2018.  With the breakout of Covid-19 in March 2020, I finally decided to give one last shot to GMAT, and this time, I chose e-GMAT for its structured methodology towards acing the GMAT exam.
After a few weeks of enrolling on the e-GMAT platform, I received an email that offered free mentorship for a selected few. My cohort of around 15 people was mentored by Dhananjay(DJ). Not only was DJ able to identify my weak areas but also provided weekly milestones that helped me improve the score linearly as I progressed through the milestones. As an example, For Reading Comprehension, I discussed the articles from 'The Economist' directly with DJ, and he asked me questions that helped me critically evaluate the passages as we read. This process helped me build stamina to read larger passages, and I also reduced my time from over 6 minutes to 3 minutes per passage.
 Furthermore, I used to spend more than 2 minutes on almost every Verbal question before I enrolled with e-GMAT, however at the end of 4 months with e-GMAT, my average attempt time was 80 Sec for SC, 105 Sec for CR, and about 110 Sec for RC.  
In the three months of my GMAT journey, not only DJ pushed me to do more but also motivated me to put in more effort to realize the dream score. I can also vouch for the e-GMAT platform because I have closely observed how e-GMAT selects its employees.

I was taking notes off its videos, practicing questions, etc. Let me tell you why I think it's the wisest investment:
1. It is very flexible - you can basically study whenever you want, wherever you want; it has a great study planner and progress tracker. Videos are bite sized and each video comes with a great summary slide with a recap of the whole lesson.
2. It focuses on making sure you understand the concept solidly. After each lesson, you take application quiz to test yourself whether you are able to apply concepts to real questions. It advises you to go back and study harder if you don't pass the predetermined benchmark.
3. It has a practice platform called Scholaranium, which has different types of quizzes and tests. It is so customizable as to allow you to pick number of questions, level, topics, etc. And most importantly, it gives you great and logical explanations to each question and answer choices. Another great feature of it is that you can practice OG questions in Scholaranium. OG provides notoriously short official explanations, and Scholaranium fixes it by giving you their experts' explanations to those answer choices. If you are stuck, there is a forum to each question, where you can post your query.

Overall, amazing investment, a very high ROI - Total score of 730 (Q49, V40).","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=90#","0","0","","","","","",""

If you're still reading through the reviews of GMAT courses, chances are you are still looking for that ""perfect course"", the course that will take your GMAT scores through the roof. I'm here to shatter your dreams. There's NO such course. 

However, e-GMAT is pretty darn close to that. e-GMAT will provide you with the tools necessary to ace the test. 

Out of all the options, WHY would you go for e-Gmat? I'll tell you why you should.

1) Structured Approach - No more ambiguity on how to approach a problem. Whatever the GMAT throws at you, you're equipped with the right approach to tackle it.

2) Discussion forums - Whatever doubts you may have, chances are some of the tens of thousands of other students who went through the same materials might have thought just like you did, too. Their questions (your questions) will be in the discussion forums, which is btw conveniently RIGHT under each question, and the questions are, most of the time, already answered.

3) EXCELLENT Customer Service- Remember that time you wanted to contact the customer service of some company and you had to wait days on end to come to a solution? Well, that won't happen with these guys. They are dang fast. 

4) Scholaranium - With these particular tools, you'll be able to focus on the areas that you're weak at. You can figure out where you are going wrong and fix those.

In 2018, i gave my 1st prep test got 640. Saw the Egmat standard videos claiming x hours into our course gives Y results.
So i believed and took the course. I prepared using the course, didnt finish their scholaranium module. Went through videos once.
So their claim might be true provided those X hours you are extremely focused. 

That claim of X hours for Y results is the worst thing that happened to me. 

So now why 5/5 review?

Its not the course that changes the trajectory, its YOU.
The course really is best in market, the quality of both verbal and quant is too good. It has everything one needs to cross 700.

For a person who is weak in verbal, this course can help greatly.  Provided you understand and listen to whats being told in videos.

There are dozens of techniques in market for verbal, and Egmat techniques are best suited for a non native like me.

Overall, i for quant club tests are GOAT. However the difficulty level of club quant tests is lower than actual tests.

For verbal egmat is a handsdown best course in market. I would still opt for Egmat because i believed in their methods.
I purchased the course in 2018,2019 2020.

That wish became a reality when I signed up for e-GMAT's mentorship program under Dhananjay, e-GMAT's Strategy expert. 
Right from Day 1 when he analyzed my ESR (from my last attempt) he focused on addressing my weaknesses and pointing them out without any inhibitions. He prepared a day-by-day action plan to work on and improve on my weak areas. Throughout the journey he made sure that I stick to the plan and imbibe all the learnings from the e-GMAT course deeply into my subconscious mind. 
This helped me a lot in my final days of the prep when I was refining my test-taking strategies to better my time management skills. Frankly, this was the one area where I had always struggled, and Dhananjay through his plan made sure that I specifically improve upon it. 

All of this culminated with a GMAT score of 720, and I would really thank the e-GMAT team for the same.  

As an additional help during the process of finalizing my GMAT date, the Support team was also kind to give me a free-extension for a couple of weeks as I was unable to find a suitable date for the exam.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=91#","0","0","","","","","",""

This really helped me refine my study plan at a time when I was not seeing any improvement. 
The SigmaX mock also helped me accurately predict my verbal score. Though the quant score was slightly off. (I got a 640 - Q48, V30), one day before the exam.

My only negative feedback point that I have for the course is that they don't have an option to watch the videos at a higher speed. Given the amount of recorded content available, I took way more time than I was hoping to, just to finish watching all the content for Verbal. Since I was already doing fairly well in Quant, I did not spend much time there. 

Overall, I would say the free portion of the course available is a pretty accurate representation of the whole.

																			by score report","","Location","It was during the Covid lokdown that I decided to prepare for the GMAT. A friend had suggested e-gmat and I attended a couple of webinars on 2-3 weekends.  The verbal webinars specially were pretty interesting and I ended up subscribing to the Online course (both Verbal and Quant).

I started with the SC section as the first step of my prep. The course was so comprehensive and the number of data points and analytics available on the performance were mind-blowing. Specially, the scores in the before and after quizzes give you such a good idea on how much you have improved post the module. In all, I would say the SC module was very useful and is a must-do for any first-time GMAT taker.

Then came the most interesting module of all, CR. Boy, the way in which each argument is broken down is wonderful and it actually helps you develop a unique way of looking at each of the CR question types.

Due to personal reasons, I did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked on the RC and the Quant modules. So, I would not be able to comment on them in detail.

In addition to the course, the most powerful tool offered as part of the e-gmat course is the 'Scholaranium'. The way in which each of the verbal questions and all the options are explained is a complete game-changer. The data points available actually help you strategise and work on your shortcomings and time management. I cannot imagine a better tool which could be made available for GMAT prep.

I had attended a couple of live sessions on SC conducted by Payal and I really liked her meaning-based approach and was able to appreciate the methodology outlines in the course even more after I attended the live classes.

After the live classes and before I gave my GMAT, I also gave 3 e-gmat mocks. Dhananjay from the support team analyzed my performance in these mocks and gave valuable inputs on how I should approach my weak areas so that I could maximize my score in the limited amount of time I had. In addition to providing inputs via mail, he also made videos of my mocks which outlined the areas/time management techniques I need to adopt. This was incredibly helpful during my last leg of prep.

Thanks e-gmat for being a part of my GMAT journey and making it memorable :)","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=91#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I gave my first GMAT attempt in July 2019, with little preparation, and got a 680 score. When I decided to re-attempt in 2020, I realized I had many conceptual gaps and lacked any understanding of test-taking strategies. In the few mocks I gave before starting preparation, I would always fall short of time and repeat the same mistakes over and over again. I, thus, decided to take the e-GMAT online course for GMAT preparation. I opted for the 2 months course (had to e-mail them for the same) and got it for $199. 
The e-GMAT course is very comprehensive, in terms of concepts (verbal and quant), strategies (difficulty-wise and time-management) and practice. I started with Verbal, as that was my weak area, and went through all the concept videos and practice and application files. This is very important. Doing these will greatly cover any conceptual gaps you have in your Verbal section and will help you develop a process to tackle different types of questions.
The biggest boost in my preparation came with the e-GMAT mentorship program. I was contacted by Deepak to sign-up for this program, for no extra charge. I had a call with him where we discussed my GMAT target score, plan and timelines, and he identified various places where I was lacking in my prep. For example, I had no strategy to manage time during the test and was not practicing enough to increase speed and apply concepts and the process. He sent me weekly targets, with daily schedule, to complete my preparation and practice, following which my prep speed increased. Also, we had a weekly/bi-weekly call to update my progress. 
After I was done with concept videos (and simultaneous practice) for both Verbal and Quant, I had around 15 days to go for the exam, during which I had to practice very efficiently through mocks. I still was lacking in managing time and questions of various difficulty levels. Deepak made a time-table for me to take mocks, review them and practice questions. I used:
1. GMATclub Quant CATs for Quant
2. e-GMAT Scholaranium for Verbal
3. OG (Online) for both

For Mocks, I used:
1. Official Mocks (1 to 4)
2. e-GMAT Sigma-X Mocks 2 & 3

Both these give a very accurate simulation of the real exam and provide the closest estimate of your ability. 
After each Sigma mock, Deepak would analyze each section, focusing on difficulty level, timing and accuracy, question-wise and section-wise. This helped me in setting a strategy that worked for me and helped me perform most effectively. Having a one-o-one mentor helped me a lot as I could route all my questions and doubts to Deepak and since he knew my weak and strong areas, he could guide me accordingly.

Would definitely recommend the e-GMAT course and the Mentorship program to anyone struggling with GMAT preparation.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=91#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I toyed with the idea of signing up for GMAT (or GMAT prep course) for a reasonable amount of time before I actually took the plunge. Hence, my decision to buy E-Gmat course was not an impulsive one but a well-researched one. Moreover, this was not the only platform I explored. E-Gmat conducts quite a few free webinars on various topics in quant and verbal. I attended all those webinars and I attended free sessions offered by 2-3 other platforms as well. I found that while the other options that I explored were more focussed on providing short-cuts and so-called smart tricks to ace the GMAT, E-Gmat focussed on mastering concepts and process, an approach that appealed to me. 

Why E-GMAT course stands out?

	Verbal course is extremely good. It starts with Master Comprehension which makes life easier in understanding (solving) all the sections of verbal. SC course builds concepts right from the basics and covers each area tested by GMAT comprehensively. The meaning-based approach emphasised by E-GMAT is the best to solve hard questions, which can never be answered by just knowing the grammatical rules

	Although CR does not have many concepts to master, the process of breaking down the argument into premises and conclusion and understanding the author’s reasoning behind the conclusion helps eliminate even the options which would otherwise seem very strong contenders. Pre-thinking the assumption (or strengthener / weakener) would involve some conscious effort, since natural instinct would be to jump right to the options. However, it’s worth putting in that effort because pre-thinking not only improves the accuracy but also reduces the takt time. 

	Reading strategies taught right since the start of the verbal course help gain a really good understanding of the RC passages, key to answering the RC questions.  

	Quant course gives all the concepts required for the test and trains us on the process which makes solving difficult questions in less than two minutes easier. E-GMAT’s quant question bank is very comprehensive and difficulty level of the questions is higher than that of the ones in the official guide or GMAT prep. Once we get used to solving harder questions, quant in the actual test turns out to be much easier.

The data points (analytics) provided by E-GMAT course are truly commendable. We get a lot of feedback on time and accuracy subsection-wise (in fact, question type-wise; eg: we know how good we are at answering assumption arguments compared to answering boldface ones). This is extremely useful in mocks. I took Sigma-X mocks and mocks offered by GMAT Prep and by third parties. While GMAT Prep mocks give a very good idea about what we can expect from the actual exam, difficulty level, etc, we cannot analyse our performance and how we can improve. Sigma-X mocks (by E-GMAT) are top-notch in this regard. We can have a complete debrief of the mock; I did not find such kind of data in the mocks offered by other third parties (I tried 2-3 sources). So, if you are looking for mocks that are a very good replica of actual GMAT and which can tell you your areas of improvement as well as provide best possible solutions to all the questions, Sigma-X mock is your answer.

Also, the kind of support you get during the entire duration of the course is worth mentioning. A lot of doubts get clarified just by going through the existing threads and you get prompt replies from the support team for all the new queries. Moreover, the team really supports you in the last few days/ weeks leading up to the test. I reached out to the support team after my first mock after course completion. Dhananjay helped me out in analysing my key areas on improvement, suggested the kind of customized tests I need to take to overcome them, even shared video analysing my mock performance. He pointed out that time management was the main thing I need to address; I followed the schedule suggested by him and in my actual GMAT I finished verbal on time and had ample time to spare after my quant section.

Summing up, looking for an all-inclusive GMAT package that can help you prepare despite a demanding job? E-GMAT is your answer!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=91#","7","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

SC: This is e-GMAT 's USP IMO. The depth and width of concepts that they cover is amazing, and I got clarity in the SC concepts. But on the higher difficulty level questions, this would have eliminated only 3 options. This is where the meaning based approach helped me. Always gauge the sentence by the meaning / logic it wants to convey, and then look for the grammatical errors in the sentence. This will reap dividends.

CR: I definitely benefitted from e-GMAT 's 3 stage approach. Identifying premises and attacking the conclusion keeping premises in mind by pre-thinking helped a lot.

RC: Full marks to e-GMAT in simplifying RC concepts. IMO, RC is just about practice. The answers are already with you in form of the passage. You have to be focused to be attentive, and be present throughout the passage. e-GMAT has good practice passages on RC

I found e-GMAT 's Scholaranium tool to be really valuable as well. It covers a good mix of easy to difficult questions, and allows you to test your skills accordingly. It helped me track my performance as well and gave me confidence that I was progressing in the right direction.

Special callout for Nava from e-GMAT when I reached out to them seeking help post my two failures in 2020. The level of detailed ESR analysis and recommendations provided by him was commendable.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=91#","2","0","","","","","",""

Program and that was a game changer.

I worked with Deepak and he did set daily tasks for me to complete. This strategy actually did wonders for me as now I was not alone in the journey and I was able to complete the course in next 3 months. 
Deepak not only helped me to complete the course on time but also guided me how to approach the next stage that is mocks. 

While I was giving mocks, Deepak not only told me my weak areas but also taught me a lot of  tricks for the exam for example - how much time should I give for a question and what is the right time to skip a question and concentrate on the next,
which is very important to score good on the exam.

All in all I am  thankful to EGMAT for its amazing modules and Scholaranium but I am more thankful to deepak for keeping a check on me, like a elder brother, motivating me, setting me on the right path and what not.

While browsing online during the start of GMAT prep days, I saw that there was a free seminar on CR hosted by e-GMAT and signed up for it to compare my ability with others. I found the seminar very useful and signed up for the e GMAT online - Verbal and Quant package. 

I used the e-GMAT study planner to create a 3 and a half week 11 hr a day study plan. 

Math and quant came easy to me so the course was used to gain a faster/better way of solving  certain problems rather than working on fundamentals. But for people that find Math hard use the course diligently. 

The verbal is the section that e-GMAT really excels at. The course helps build the fundamentals, provide a way to look at SC, RC and CR with logic and meaning. The support team was really helpful with clarifying any questions or doubts I had.
I would recommend e-GMAT's verbal package for everyone trying to improve their understanding of the verbal section. 
If the platform is used properly it will definitely help in boosting your score.

It is a fantastic product which helps you improve your concepts and apply the learning to consolidate it. The course is thoughtfully broken down into small sub parts which helps you focus  & identify your weak areas.
I would highly recommend this product for all aspirants who want to ACE GMAT. 

Also E-GMAT support is great. They were kind enough to extend my subscription multiple times and once free of cost.

																			by score report","","Instructor","Before I started using the E-gmat's verbal live prep course, I had used Magoosh premium subscription, manhattan verbal guides, and the Powerscore CR bible for my verbal preparation, so basically, I had a fair idea of the content tested in the verbal section. 

I was scoring in the low 30(s) on the official mock tests. However, I was almost never confident about my answers in SC, I was stuck between 2 choices for almost 40% of 600 level questions questions and almost all 700 questions, and I was usually lost during the RC section.

For someone who had basic knowledge about the content but who struggled to apply those concepts, my set of pros and cons for the course are as follows:-

PROS:-
1. E-gmat has absolutely nailed the idea of what GMAT wants to test.  The meaning based approach in every element of the test is what one needs to perform better on the test and E-gmat's course is built on that idea. After taking the course, I started primarily focusing on taking my time and comprehending the information that was presented to me and I can't stress on how important that is, especially on the harder questions.
2. The structured approach by E-gmat for every section provides you with a toolkit to attack any type of question with confidence. It is very essential to have a strategy for individual question types to avoid last-minute hiccups, to be confident about your preparation, and to save some precious time. 
3. The course is very comprehensive. I have never seen a course that is nearly as comprehensive as E-gmat when it comes to SC. They have dealt with almost everything that can be tested.
4. Brilliant instructors who know how to impart their knowledge to you.
5. The course is optimized for non-natives and it is very helpful to build your verbal (and English in some cases) knowledge for the GMAT and the world beyond that.
6. Seamless live classes which were very interactive.
7. In the course, there was a section about how to read stuff on the GMAT. It can be a game changer was those who need to channelize their brain for the GMAT and leave behind some  counterproductive reading habits. For instance, as someone who has only taken Indian competitive exam, I was highly motivated to skim through the RC passages and finish reading them as soon as possible. E-gmat certainly helped me to break this habit and to read the GMAT way.
8. The scholaranium has some great GMAT-like questions to practice.
9. Value for money.
10. E-gmat provides you with amazing, personalized strategy to prepare for the test and to approach the test on the D-day.

CONS:-
1. As someone who was already scoring in the 30s, who had basic idea of the content, and who had solved and deeply analysed some 150 questions in the verbal official guides, I don't think the live sessions added much value to me. The idea was to do some questions live using the E-gmat approach and to build the discussion on them. However, in all the sessions, I thought that the fact that I already registered while going through the online course or had practiced while solving a scolaranium question was reinstated. If you resonate with my type of profile, I highly recommend that you go for the online verbal course rather than the live prep course. However, if you are struggling with the foundational knowledge, you should go for the latter.
2. As per my experience, the query resolution system on the E-gmat forum is not very robust. I would give a shoutout to Magoosh here for almost always resolving my question with a very comprehensive solution within 24 hours. I don't know if it happened just with me but the queries I wrote on e-gmat forum were solved in a week or more, and once, a query was resolved after a month. 

Verdict: I think the pros of the course far-outweigh the cons and I don't regret my investment in the course at all. If you are thinking about the current verbal score I hold, it is solely because of how I deviated from the devised strategy on the test-day because of test anxiety and not at all because of anything provided by E-gmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=92#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","E-GMAT's Mentorship program is a sure-shot means to achieving a top GMAT score. When I approached the e-GMAT strategy team for assistance with my study plan, I was fortunate enough to have been referred to Ashutosh (E-GMAT mentor), who added me to his cohort of 14 absolutely brilliant individuals. I will go through each component in detail: 

1. Weekly hyper-specific study plans: Having them at my disposal helped eliminate ambiguity, and gave me a direction as to what I need to do on a daily basis. There were definitely a few weeks when I could not keep up with the deadlines due to several other engagements, but the weekly check-ins and the subsequent reprimands (haha) surely helped me stay consistent. 

2. Motivation-booster: In the third month of my preparation, I was not able to score anywhere near my dream score. I felt as if I couldn’t do it, and was almost on the verge on giving up. It was then that Ashutosh helped me believe in myself and not give up, at least not without a fight. We also had strategy huddle sessions every two weeks where the entire cohort met virtually, discussed individual problems and where we were presented with case studies describing the flaws in different study plans and ways to avoid them. Having people transverse the same journey as yours, undoubtedly helps you in staying motivated and trusting the process. 

3. Course-Correction: I absolutely hated making error logs, the primary reason why I was not achieving my dream score. After taking a few mocks, Ashutosh and I had a call wherein he pinpointed how I absolutely need to identify the pattern in my mistakes. That advice worked like magic. Although, I didn’t continue with the error log for too long, it definitely helped me streamline the most important phase of my preparation. 

4. E-GMAT Course: Last but not the least, the e-GMAT course is one of the best courses available currently. It goes over all the minute details, and also provides the user with regular feedback points to evaluate one’s understanding in a particular topic. It is the only resource you need to prepare for the GMAT. 

I would highly recommend this program to all aspiring test-takers. These mentors work with an unmatched passion because they really want you to succeed. Ashutosh was always available for me, and answered even my most frivolous queries without a sign of irritation. All he ever asked for in return was sincerity and consistency. Most importantly, I’m grateful to the entire e-GMAT team for such a seamless and a wonderful experience. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=92#","6","0","","","","","",""

I am glad to inform you all that I score a 730 on my GMAT finally!
I would like to thank the E Gmat team for this improvement, since without them , this score seemed like a distant dream.
I remember the first time after purchasing the course, I opened E Gmat and felt pretty lost. I decided to contact the support team and within 2 hours I received back a reply detailing the best way I should go ahead with my GMAT goal.
The plan laid out by the support team was really helpful .
There were strict accuracy percentages defined and there were times when I couldn't reach them, however, the Egmat team was always encouraging in these situations and motivated me to do better.
After I completed my prep, I decided to take a sigma x mockand got a 700.It was then that Dhananjay was assigned to me as my Test Strategy Consultant. The very next day , Dhananjay sent me the next steps and analysed my mock.He made me realise that how I had a hard time letting go of questions and how my performance in Algebra was not upto the mark.
The best thing about preparing with E GMAT was the level of personal attention one gets. There were times when i got low and I was doing good, it was during these times that the  E GMAT team supported me and pushed me to get back out there and work harder, AND I CNT THANK THEM ENOUGH FOR THAT!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=92#","0","0","","","","","",""

I was struggling on both quant and Verbal but more on Verbal and the course provides really good advanced questions that allowed me to get used to what I would see on exam day.  I was hesitant at first about the Quant course but I ended up doing it and have no regrets.  It helped me especially in the advanced topics section where the guidance from the course helped me achieve a top score.

																			by score report","","Location","I came across e-gmat course on one of the gmatclub's forum. I was struggling with SC early-on and wasn't sure of a reliable source. I tried the free version of the e-gmat SC course and found it to be extremely effective. Not only were the concepts laid down clearly but they were subsequently strengthened through practice / application files. My initial plan was to only complete SC theory from the e-gmat's video course. But I was so impressed with the comprehensiveness of the content that I also completed the RC and CR course provided by them. Infact, I also ended up buying their quant course and sigma-x mocks, each of which played a significant part in my preparation.

Additionally, e-gmat strategy team's support for the students enrolled in their course is exceptional. It has been rarely the case that a query sent from me has taken more than a day to get resolved. I would specifically like to mention one of their strategy team's member Dhananjay (DJ) , who I came across when I asked for a review from e-gmat's team for one of my sigma-x mocks. I distinctly remember the detailed video-analysis that he provided for my first mock attempt. I was surprised by how close it was to my own assessment of the test. The fact that that my preparation issues include both ability and time management became clear to me only when he used the sigma-x mock's ESR to explain me where I was spending more time. Additionally, my attitude of not letting go the harder questions was hurting me big time in the mocks. I was aware of this issue already but I guess hearing it out loud from someone makes all the difference.

Lastly, I would like to point out that my last week interactions with the team, especially with DJ went a long way in giving me a clear direction on the way forward. Contrary to the popular opinion that one should only revise the concepts and not burn yourself out in the last, I was advised to give some gmatclub mocks to fill in the gaps still existing in my timing strategy. This went a long way in making my actual GMAT experience extremely smooth and unnerving.

Cannot thank e-gmat team enough for the support. I am planning to give the GMAT exam again in future to increase my score further and would mostly choose the e-gmat course again.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=93#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

The verbal part is very detailed as well, although I personally felt I spent too much time watching the first units.

Pros:

The SC course is definitely hands-down one of the best courses in the market currently. It's extremely beneficial for people with conceptual gaps. I increased my accuracy in SC from ~60% to ~80% with the help of this course.

I personally feel the RC is pretty good too. I was struggling with RC and none of the 'shortcuts' or 'techniques' I found online helped me with this. The e-GMAT's RC module with its 'predicting the flow of the passage' and 'involving yourself in the passage' really made sense and helped me a lot!

Cons:

The number of questions for practice is very low. Considering other good courses such as Expert's Global (comparing solely based on the number of questions/ quizzes),  the number of questions and quizzes for practice in e-GMAT scholaranium is very low.

I gave my GMAT again and now have a 720 with Q50 V37 (might give it another shot). The increase in the verbal score is majorly because of my increase in accuracy in SC. BIG TIME!

																			by score report","Points","Location","I think E-Gmat is a very good value for your money service. I took the GMAT Prep mock test to get an idea of where I was before starting preparation and scored a 720. I purchased the Egmat course because I was targeting a score of 760. I think their sentence correction course is really good. In my case I think it improved my verbal score by 01-02 points but that is because I was already at a good level. I took the GMAT test and scored a 730. My sigma mock scores were as follows:
1) 700 (Before starting preparation)
2) 700 (After completing sentence correction section)
3) 750 (one week after mock 2- in this week i practiced in the scholaranium)
4) 760 (one week after mock 3- continued scholaranium practice) 
5) 760
GMAT Prep 2- 760

Afterwards I didn't prepare for 06 months and it was only last week that I started preparing again but this time around I focused more on the official problems and practiced my weak areas from the previous ESR and scored a 760 with 05 days of preparation. 

In conclusion Egmat is a good course but if you want an elite score you need to focus on the official guide more. Egmat's sentence correction is very good but limited in terms of difficult problem types. Their RC is good and I think their Critical Reasoning is the weakest part of the three, albeit still good.
I gave it 05 stars because it is very cheap. 
One thing that I didn't like was that I tried to talk to Mr.Rajat or Payal but I couldn't until after I had taken the test. Eventually I figured it out myself on how to score higher in the retest.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=93#","0","0","","","","","",""

They also have mentors who review your profile and give study advice, which I greatly benefited from. I will give a couple of points as advice for aspiring GMAT test takers.
1. Sign up for eGMAT. It works. 
2. After signing up, do not rush into studying the course materials and solving questions right away. They have a few informative videos to guide you on how to best use their coursework and their question banks; this really teaches you HOW to go about studying and preparing for this test and best exploit their resources.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","After one failed attempt at the GMAT on Feb 26th 2020 in which I scored a 660(Q48 & V32), I decided it was time for me to take some external support. Going with the most popular rated course on the Gmat Club, I got myself enrolled with e-GMAT. Being an engineer and good at math, Quant came naturally to me. Verbal was my weakest area and I needed serious help in it. On knowing that the Verbal Online package didn’t include any mocks, I opted to go for the GMAT Online package, which included Quant and Verbal course, 5 SigmaX mocks and a hoard of other questions for practise on its Scholaranium platform. Looking back it was the best decision I had taken in my prep.

After accessing the course for 2 weeks, I got a phone call from Dhananjay (DJ), who would be my future mentor, asking whether I would be interested in a Mentorship program. I was told that this program would make me a part of a cohort of 15 applicants like me who were also in their preparation phase, that I’d be given daily milestones to meet and that at the end of the week the mentor would have a strategic huddle with the cohort so as to discuss the short comings of the week gone by. I could not find any reason to say no and I immediately hopped on board. What followed was an extremely well planned and guided course of action. As promised we were given our milestones and had weekly huddles in which DJ would boost our Morales, discussing the success stories of various students who had achieved their target scores using the same platform. The mentorship program made me feel accountable for my performance and made me realize the mistakes I had made during my first attempt. The e-GMAT mocks are a good representative of the actual GMAT and the Scholaranium questions also comprise of a good mix. In short, once I had the access to the e-GMAT platform, I never felt the need for more. I would highly recommend anyone, who is especially facing any issue with the Verbal section, to get enrolled in the mentorship program and be truthful to it.  

To be honest for any program to work, we ourselves play a very critical role. Unless we are extremely critical of and truthful with ourselves, no study material can help us reach the target score. Likewise, e-GMAT also mentions so in a very clear way. For e.g. the mentorship program would not have worked if I wasn’t honest to DJ about meeting my milestones or if I didn’t tell him the actual issues I was facing, I wouldn’t get the advice I expected. It is a two way street. Here, I’d like to appreciate the role DJ has played with all my sincerity. He was always there when I scored badly on my mocks to lift my morale, to help me with any specific issue and at the same time he showed me the mirror when I was going wrong and when it was time to pull up my socks. I ended up getting a 750 on my third attempt. Not only my verbal score improved from a V32 to a V41, but my Quant score also improved from a Q48 to a Q50. Although, I did not use the e-GMAT Quant course but I sure did practise the sums on its Scholaranium platform, which helped me a lot. 

On a parting note I’d like to mention two takeaways one from each of the founders of e-GMAT.
Once while attending a webinar Rajat mentioned there are two types of students who access the same material, one achieves his target score while the other one fails to achieve it. He asks us the reason why? Both the students had access to the same material, so ideally both of them should have succeeded. So what was that differentiating factor? 
On similar lines, at the beginning of the e-GMAT course, Payal, in one of her videos about the various stages of learning, talks about the importance of being self-critical. She puts forth a very interesting strategy that helped me particularly during my prep. It was asking the question WHY? If you get a SC question right, figure out why did you get it right? Similarly, if you get a SC question wrong, figure out the reason? What made you select the wrong choice and eliminate the right one? I think this level of self-criticality is expected out of every one of us taking a dig at GMAT.

Lastly, I’d like to say always look at the big picture. Do not lose sight of it. GMAT is not the end of the world.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=94#","2","0","","","","","",""

The eGMAT online platform is also one of the best I have seen so far:

·         The SIGMA mock tests give you analytics on time taken per question and section of the GMAT. This is as close to the ESR as you can get. This was crucial for me and my mentors to understand what was happening to me in the test mode and devise a strategy to get over my areas of weakness.

* I was skeptical about my scope to improve on Quant but eGMAT made it possible. Without the exceptional support and guidance from Karan and Ashutosh, I do not think this would be possible. 

If you have limited time and are keen to get a good score, I would recommend the eGMAT mentorship program without a doubt. I owe my score almost entirely to them. My only regret is, I wish I had found them earlier.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=94#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","The best part about the e-GMAT course is that it offers an accurate, well planned and data-driven approach to help you work towards improving your GMAT score at a very affordable price. 

To give some context, I took the GMAT last year by relying only on the Official Guide. While this helped me realize my baseline score, it also made me realize several concept and process weaknesses that I knew I had to work on. I needed a very personalized approach that allowed me to build a strong conceptual foundation from scratch and then develop systematic approaches to solving each type of question possible in the test. I quickly realized that the only way to get this would be through a tutor that could give me personalized attention but at a significant cost. 

e-GMAT however is able to provide a very similar service by leveraging data analysis to understand a student's strengths and weaknesses thoroughly. The team of experts is with you every step of the way in charting out a structured plan on cementing Quantitative and Verbal concepts and processes. I  exchanged 40+ emails with the team. They were very quick and detailed in their responses. A special thanks to Deepak Bansal and Karan Kantharia for their support throughout this journey. Various team experts supported me while I was learning the concepts and processes. Deepak was able to use my quiz attempt and mock test data to provide valuable insight into critical weaknesses that I had. The key weaknesses that he was able to point out were pacing myself, paying special attention to key weak areas in RC & SC and revisiting concept files for specific topics in Q or V. I was able to improve my score from 690 to 740 in my first attempt since working with e-GMAT. I was able to push it 10 points higher because of further inputs from Deepak on specific areas of improvement.

To use e-GMAT's empowering tools to excel, you will need the following traits:
1. Adaptability: Initially, you will need to be very adaptable to change your existing thought processes and systems. The more adaptable you are, the more quickly you will be able to learn the e-GMAT way.
2. Sincerity: One of the key aspects to being successful with e-GMAT is to follow their recommendations thoroughly. The more sincere and diligent you are in taking the recommendations of experts seriously, the more you will benefit.
3. Trust the process: Their methods have stood the test of time and generated several success stories. Trusting the process is essential in helping you take ownership of your journey to excel at the GMAT. This will also allow you to give it your 100% when transforming the way you approach the GMAT.

With these traits and the support that the team offers, I have no doubt that you will be successful in achieving a higher score than you would by yourself!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=94#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

Acing GMAT is not an easy journey. When I first saw an SC problem, I felt that I will never be able to do well on this exam.  Some of my peers who scored well could solve SC Qs in less than a minute. I continued to ask myself what is it that I am missing. 

I tried several offline coaching institutes. Solved OG, coaching institute material and what not. It still took me at least 3 mins to tackle a SC Qs. 

Finally, I came across e-GMAT's SC course. Its approach of teaching SC was no where close to what I had been taught. One module at a time, I kept moving. It took me about a month to internalise every concept. And after doing so, my SC skills were far better than some of the best English writers. I became so proficient that at times I could spot errors in newspaper editorials. 

Since then I have recommended e-GMAT's SC to at least 10 friends who have shared similar problems as mine. 

I jumped from V19 to V34. And now I am close to V 40. My concepts are totally clear, however, comprehension and speed need more work. 

I thank the e-GMAT's team and would like to tell all my fellow community members here, don't give up; we will get there!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=94#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I already had attempted GMAT in 2019 and had scored a 650 (Q49,V29). I was working Schlumberger Asia Srvices Ltd. as a field engineer and decided to go for MBA in 2019. I was disappointed with my score, but understood that GMAT preparation would require some time and dedication. So I quit Schlumberger and started preparing for GMAT in January'20. I was running short of time because I wanted to apply to schools in R1 in 2020. So this gave me 6 months to prepare. Initially I didn't take it seriously and thought that it's just another Post Grad exam. I had subscribed to E-GMAT comprehensive course. At the end of March'20, it was clear to me that GMAT is not just another post Grad Exam, and that it required time to score good.
After I finished my course content on E-GMAT portal, I was hoping to have improve my score from 650-700 at least (A very poor assumption). On my first Sigma-X mocks (E-GMAT Mocks), I scored a 610 and was devastated.  But the next day, I received an email from Dhananjay Lowe (DJ) asking if I wanted to enroll to E-GMAT Mentorship Program. I was offered it for free as iE-GMAT was running a pilot for the program. I accepted and enrolled to the mentorship program. That's where things changed. 
After my discussion with DJ, he gave me milestones to cover every week in terms of my preparation and based on my performance in the milestones, the milestones were prepared. It was customised for everyone in the mentorship cohort. 
I achieved every milestone because I actually saw improvement in my scores and understanding of the GMAT. As days passed by, my scores improved. But the improvement in scores was minimal to begin with and I grew impatient with GMAT Preparation. But the weekly discussions with DJ really calmed me down. And by the mid of May'20, I had crossed the 700 mark. I was targeting a 750-760 (I still am), and so I continued my preparation with full belief in the mentorship program.  I started scoring a 750-760 in official mocks and Sigma-X Mocks.  So I booked a date for GMAT on 11th of July'20. I was really confident but had ignored the little details which caused my score to dip. I became a little complacent towards the exam. There were 2 major mistakes I made. I forgot my passport at home and I never realised the order of the sections until the exam day. But those were minor hiccups and cannot be used as an excuse to justify my score of 710 (Q51,V34). There were several things which I realised after the exam as I had gone through a lot of materials online apart from E-GMAT courses and tests. No one can help you to score good except for you. Other programs and courses can help you to cross a certain threshold but at the end of the day, GMAT is a very logical and structured exam and it requires proper understanding of things. There are no definite rules to most of the verbal questions and the section is rightly named Verbal Reasoning. I realised that there is a limit to which anybody could have helped me in my preparation and that the rest was up to me. But E-GMAT Mentorship Program really helped me to cross that threshold. During the program, I improved massively on CR and SC. I am going to go for another attempt in a month or so to improve my score from a 710 to a 750-760.

																			by score report","","Location","Hey everyone,

Hope everyone reading this, is doing fine! 
So, let me give a brief about my GMAT preparation journey and few of the important factors that helped me along the way. I began my preparation for the GMAT towards the end of May 2020. . Upon some research and some credible sources later, I decided on e-GMAT as the final decision, and boy, did I not regret it a bit!
Since I had given myself only 2 months to prepare for the GMAT, I decided to buy the GMAT Online course (Verbal and Quants). The course was great, and a special shout out for their Verbal course and the depth and the modularity of it just makes it so easy for the student. I am glad that, this was my first choice of preparation.
The course apart, what really impressed me was their exceptional support team, which was always there for any query , be it related to the course or the strategy ahead. I was given very detailed solutions to my query, which definitely helped me focus on the more important stuff.
One of e-GMAT's best products is the SigmaX Mocks. This not only emulates the adaptive nature of the GMAT, but also provides ESR like analysis and loads of granular data to learn from. It was of great help. One of the better examples, was when I reached out to the support team post one of my mocks, to get their analysis on the same. Mr. Dhananjay(DJ) responded to me with a detailed analysis of the mock, and provided inputs which would later help me channelize my energy, to get a high score.
In his analysis, he had highlighted points like my struggle with letting go of questions and hence jeopardizing my chances at further questions. He also brought out through his analysis, the fact that I was being over-cautious at the start, when it could be seen that I was able to solve harder questions later at a much faster rate.
Such points helped me shift my focus from only concepts to developing a test taking strategy and a smart skipping strategy. I started consciously practicing the art of letting go, as suggested by Mr. Dhananjay. He also laid out a detailed step by step path for the last few days prior to the GMAT. It was designed along the path of polishing the slightly weaker areas, but also working at developing a test taking stamina. These points really helped me get ready for the test and overcome any jitters there might have been. I did end up with a good score, and I would like to thank Dhananjay and the whole support team of e-GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=94#","1","0","","","","","",""

I enrolled in the mentorship program about 10 days after I bought the e-GMAT course and started my preparation in January 2020.  And starting from then till the exam date, my mentor Karan was there to guide me through every stage of my preparation.  During that phase, there were a lot of times when I was stuck and confused about how to handle my weak areas, or whether my pace of preparation is good or not. But none of my doubts and queries went unanswered as he was there to relieve me of that stress. Also, the weekly check-ins on my progress were critical as it made me accountable to someone.

What makes the mentorship program a game-changer is its ability to cater to the specific needs and requirements of every student individually. There can't be one common strategy for all, and hence with the mentorship program, one can expect personalized attention and strategy tips that can't be found anywhere else.

In conclusion, I would just like to say that don't think twice before enrolling for the e-GMAT Mentorship program. It will surely be the best investment you make in your GMAT journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=95#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Instructor","I started my GMAT journey late January so I had four months to study before my first exam on May 18. On the test date, I went there just to find out that the test center was closed (even though I was receiving all confirmation emails normally), so I rescheduled the test for 2 days later in another location (6 hours away from the city I live in). I took the test and got a 700 (35V, 49Q).

In these first 4 months I studied mainly with MPrep theory for verbal and quant and question bank from OG. My OG mocks were around 710-730 so I expected something closer to 710-720. And after the test, I felt that I had exhausted my study materials and even though I wanted to retake the exam, I didn't know where to begin or where to focus. 

So, in early June I contacted eGmat, since I knew my biggest weakness was Verbal. We discussed my test performance (with the ESR) and I went through all the theory through their platform, but now what really changed was not the concepts per se, but how to apply their method (pre-think, don`t skim, etc...) and stick to it. A month later, I took a new mock and got a 750, which got me very excited. 

That's when I contacted their Support to make sure I was ready to reschedule the test. In the following 15 days, Ashutosh worked closely with me, providing me guidance on where to focus and reviewing my progress every two days. My main weakness by then was CR, that I needed an extra focus to make sure I was going to excel in the test day.  A week before the test I took another mock, which I scored 740. This made me feel confident that was really ready.

I took the test again July 18 and got a 730 (39V, 50Q) and felt so relieved! Now I`m working on the app process.

I can confidently say that eGmat was an exceptional part of my study improvement for two main reasons: (1) the mocks are HARD, but somewhat similar to test day, (2) they go deep into sticking to the method and that was a key differential + their quizzes are great for further practice (specially medium and hard questions, that are tough to find).

The handholding aspect is a must have if you like to study alone, but want some guidance during the process. I really appreciated Ashutosh support and feedback during the process. It gave me an extra energy to keep studying specially during the final days before the test.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=95#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","eGMAT’s mentorship programme is, hands down, one of the best products out there. The programme provides you with personalised support from one of eGMAT’s mentors, who will guide you every step of the way to ensure that you keep up with your prep and that you have all it takes to crack the exam.

Let me tell just how this works in real life and how each of the components of the programme translated to my personal case:

• Initial call. I had a call with my Archit Bhargava, my eGMAT mentor, who asked me enough questions to understand how my journey had been until then, what my goals were, and were my strengths and areas for improvement were. It was amazing to see how, by asking the right questions, he could quickly arrive at the key issues that we needed to work on. This call was the base for creating the roadmap we would follow over the following months

• Weekly milestones. Based on our initial call, Archit provided me with an overall roadmap that translated into very concrete, day-specific milestones. What’s great about this milestone-driven plan is that it gives you a very strong sense of direction and accomplishment: you wake up and you know exactly what you need to do, and as you complete the milestones, you get a true sense that you are confidently moving forward. This moves you away from “oh so what should I focus on today? Algebra or Critical Reasoning?” or “I feel I have been studying for long enough now, maybe take a mock?”

• Weekly touch base. Every week, my mentor would reach out to ask the status of my milestones, and we would iterate to adjust the plan for the next week, calibrating for new developments, availability and goals. My particular situation was that work was quite unpredictable at times, so the fact that we iterated and readjusted the plan on a weekly basis was great for me – just what I needed to keep moving at an optimum pace

• Strategy Hurdle sessions. Once every 2-3 weeks, we would do a one-hour session with other members of the programme and our mentor. In those sessions, we would go over issues that go beyond the actual content, but that definitely add up to your overall performance: key pitfalls students find along their GMAT prep journey and how to overcome them, time management during the exam, how to balance between a demanding personal and work life and the need to study consistently, and so on. These sessions were great in that we were presented with real life examples of other people (who I could definitely relate to more than once), and we got the chance to share with others who were going through the same situation as us

• Individual calls. We conducted individual calls with my mentor as we saw fit. In these calls, we discussed the overall status of the prep, any roadblocks I was finding, and potential solutions to overcome them. Whatever the topic of the discussion, the fundamental principle was this: “how do we adjust the plan so that your prep is advancing, effective, and sustainable?”. Basically, we looked for ways to keep moving forward and avoid being stagnated, ensuring that what we did actually allowed me to learn what I needed to learn, and that the pace was sustainable given other areas of my life (for example, work)

Overall, a great opportunity to learn in a truly personalised way. If you are willing to commit to your prep and invest the time it takes to get your target score, this is really good value for money.

Personally, I am sincerely grateful to eGMAT and the mentoring programme – they were a key part of my being able to move from 620 to 760!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=95#","8","0","","","November 20, 2020","egmat","https://gmatclub.com/forum/members/member-216316.html","Hey @valentinfs

I started my GMAT prep in Feb 2020 with an aim to take the GMAT by end of April 2020; I figured that a time frame of almost 3 months should be good enough to get a top score. Having been a good student all my life, I really thought that this was an achievable target. 

I began my prep by solving all 4 books from Kaplan – including GMAT 800 which is supposed to be a book on advanced-level questions. I found the questions from all books to be quite easy and cruised through all the books in less than a month. Once I had solved all the questions in all the books, I took a Kaplan mock test in which I scored 690. In the following days, I took another couple of mocks and scored 670 and 680. I was not even breaching the 700 mark and needed to change my preparation strategy. But at this point, I realized that I was all out of prep material and would need to buy a new course. By a stroke of luck I came across an e-GMAT webinar, which led me to purchase the entire course.  

About 5 days after I started studying from the e-GMAT course I received an email from Deepak asking if I would like to enroll under the mentorship program. Seeing no downside to having a dedicated mentor, I gladly agreed. 

Deepak gave me a day-by-day planning of the tasks that I would have to do, every week. These activities could be learning concepts, taking cementing quizzes or taking practice quizzes. In case I encountered any problems, or felt like I needed additional practice of a particular topic, I would shoot an email to Deepak and he would quickly re-work my study plan. It was amazing to have this kind of personal attention for an exam which is mostly self-prep. 

While following Deepak’s study plan, I encountered some problems. For my critical reasoning prep, I wasn’t scoring well in quizzes even after spending enough time on the concept files. I wasn’t even able to pre-think, a skill that is quite important to be able to crack the CR section of the GMAT. So I notified Deepak of the issue and immediately he re-worked my study plan to give me more practice for CR. 

Another issue was that I felt very fatigued with the prep and Deepak, being the excellent mentor that he is, gave me a confidence boost by reassuring me that I was actually doing well. This may seem trivial but trust me such boosts go a long way.

Deepak also conducted fortnightly strategy huddles in which he would discuss topics pertinent to taking the GMAT. These huddles not only helped me improve my approach to taking the test (for example, better time management), but also helped me interact with members of my cohort, most of whom were in the same boat as I. 

I took Deepak’s guidance from April to June 2020 and I was able to take the GMAT within 10 days of my target date. 



Test day experience 

On the test day, I was mostly confident of my capabilities. I had put in the work so there was no reason to worry. Moreover, I was extremely well-rested and had two 700 or higher scores from my mock tests.

Coming into the test, I had taken 2 mocks from e-GMAT, scoring 750 and 700 respectively. I just chalked off the lower score to disturbances while I was taking the test. In hindsight, I should have taken another test to be sure of my prep level. 

My test center was terrible. It was very dirty. There was a carpet which was full of dust. The bathroom was a short walk away from the test room and was also dirty. The air conditioner was not able to cool the room. The test administrator entered the test room a couple of times to try and get the air conditioner to work better, resulting in disturbance while taking the test. The keyboards were not convenient for typing and many times more than one key got pressed when I was writing my essay. The keyboards were also below a certain height - resulting in typing inconvenience. There was a lot of lag in the system as well - after selecting a choice, I would have to wait a few seconds for the radio button to reflect my choice. Finally, there were monkeys right outside the center's main door. This was an extremely poor testing experience for me. 

I scored 710 in the exam. Q49, V39, IR 8, AWA 6. I’m mostly happy with the score, but feel like I could’ve scored better in a decent test center. 

To conclude, I would like to say that GMAT prep is a marathon and not a sprint. So, please keep enough time for your prep, and even time to re-take the test if necessary. You may do everything right but the wrong test center may also ruin your score. If possible, check out the test center beforehand. Focus on the test-taking strategies rather than trying to get every question right. Sometimes, skipping questions is better for your score than sticking with them. Invest in good prep material. If possible, reach out to your friends who might have taken the GMAT and ask about their experiences with different prep materials.

Shout out to Deepak for being an amazing mentor and friend.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=95#","2","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Location","I took the e-GMAT and was absolutely amazed with my results.
I started off with a 570 in my first mock with a Q36.
I mainly used the course as a learning tool and focused my practice on OG material (even though Scholaranium was absolutely great).
Let's go by parts:

Verbal: e-GMAT's material for verbal is great, especially SC. It covers all you need in a detailed manner. And the pre-thinking approach in CR was also highly helpful.

Quant: quant is where I needed to focus the most. e-GMAT's approach is to really sink in the concepts and show you how to apply them in the questions, rather than just teaching you each type of questions and its trick. And that's the thing, when you learn the concepts and you come across a question that you don't even know how to start, if you know the concept, write it down and it might just lead you down the right path.

Overall my experience with e-GMAT was as great as it could be, and I would 100% recommend it to my close friends who are considering taking the GMAT test.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=95#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Attempt 1 – GMAT 670 (V33, Q49)- Jan 2019
I gave my first GMAT attempt after scoring 700 on official GMAT Prep, hoping I can convert that to 750 on the actual test. But what I’d failed to consider is that unlike normal tests (where I perform better in pressure) GMAT is something different. There were a lot of things that led to my downfall during my first attempt, but I believe following few to be the major ones:
1.	Not having clarity of the GMAT scores I want – I thought anything above the magic 700 barrier will be amazing. And for some candidates this might be the case, but for the kind of MBA schools I was targeting, I didn’t realize that Indian MBA male with 700 is below average. 
2.	Not focusing enough on official GMAT prep – After completing my official GMAT prep, I immediately went online to find more questions. I didn’t understand the concept of quality over quantity at that time.  
3.	Not completing E-GMAT Scholaranium- After several referrals from my friends, I bought the E-GMAT verbal course. And in a word, it was  an “amazing” course. But my only regret is that I didn’t use it to my advantage completely. I only considered the course as an online grammar tutorial for SC questions, I completely skipped the CR and RC part and again jumped straight to the questions. 
Scholaranium has a great set of 400-500 questions for Verbal. But to my surprise, I could hardly score 50% correct in the medium and hard category. But I disregarded my failure as the questions being too hard (and so I needn’t bother myself with the results). So, in the end I completed only about 150-200 questions.
4.	Not doing enough practice tests – I completed only 2 full length official prep tests and that’s it. In my opinion, this was my biggest downfall as the biggest problem I faced during my actual GMAT was pacing and time management. 
5.	Not using GMATClub Quant tests – I was a bit overconfident on my Quant skills (coming from an IIT) that I almost skipped quant prep. And the thing that I regret most is not using the GMATClub quant test (that came free with an E-gmat subscription). These tests are by far the best resources one could use to score Q51. These tests are harder, lengthier, trickier but just by a bit. If one can score Q50/Q51 in these tests, actual GMAT quant will be a piece of cake.  
 
Attempt 2 – GMAT 730(V38, Q50)- Oct 2019
After my horrible failure at first attempt, I made amends and started preparing for success. I changed my studying strategy and started focusing on each sub-section individually and targeting specific mistakes. 
1.	Sentence Correction – I think SC is easiest and hardest at the same time. Easiest to score -if you know what you are doing, and Hardest to score – if you get confused. For SC, I mainly worked on Official GMAT prep questions, GMATClub SC top 100 700-800level questions, Aristotle GMAT SC and E-GMAT verbal Scholaranium questions. This time, I restricted myself in terms of no. of questions but instead focused on recording my errors in an error log and making sure I avoid  mistake repetition. 
2.	Critical Reasoning – I studied CR mainly from Power bible and Manhattan CR. And I focused on each and every question type individually, mainly focusing on assumptions and Boldface (which were my weakest sections)
3.	Reading Comprehension – Fortunately, I decided to follow E-GMAT method of tacking RC questions and developed the habit of taking notes and summary after each para. I realized that though it may seem excessive at first, it helps increase your consistency and accuracy .
4.	Quant – I was completely devastated with my failure in Quant and decided to be extra cautious this time around. And I spent most of my time giving GMATClub Quant Tests, while focusing on reviewing each and every correct/incorrect answer choice with an expert's explanation to find out the most optimal way of solving the problem. 
 
Test Day Experience – I was quite comfortable this time around as it was my 2nd attempt and I knew all of the procedures. I started with my quant section and completed it within time, and I was reasonably happy with myself. I went to take the optional break but to my surprise the washroom was occupied. Consequently, I spent a couple of minutes waiting outside. But when I reached my workstation I was in awe. Somehow, I managed to spend 4 minutes additional time and that was already deducted from my Verbal section time. I tried to organize my thoughts, but my brain refused to function. I sat again for 5 min in front of my first SC question trying to make sense of the foreign language in front of me. Somehow, I managed to calm myself down and complete the next 20 questions in 45 mins. But it was already too late for me, Now I needed to solve 16 questions in ~15 min. Panic started to settle again, and I knew I had to guess  few of the answers. I completed Verbal, IR, AWA and instinctively knew that my score is again going to be a sub 700 failure. But to my surprise, the screen read 730 and I was happy beyond words. 
 
 
Attempt-3 GMAT Online 770 (Q51, V44) – June 2020
 
Some of you may think that story should have ended. I thought so too. But I still hadn’t corrected one of my first mistakes – Knowing the scores I want in GMAT. 
After 730, I applied to 3 top 10 US B-schools but to my surprise got interview invite from only 1 of them. And the major reason for that is I believe my GMAT score. That’s when I decided that I should make use of my time at lock-down and give one last attempt at GMAT.
Following are the few resources/steps that helped me finally beat GMAT:
1.	E-GMAT Team support - With the score of 750-60 in my mind, I immediately sent my ESR to the E-GMAT team and requested their help to understand my weaknesses further. I was surprised to see that they provided me a detailed breakdown of my shortcomings and gave me a 5-step approach (along with video directions) to reach my targeted goals. 
According to them I had to improve my ability in CR, SC and improve my pace during the full exam. 
2.	Improving Ability in CR with Pre-thinking – Although I was aware of Pre-thinking. I knew what it meant, I knew how to do it but somehow, I just though doing the questions without pre-thinking is faster. But with the help of E-GMAT resources, I was able to develop a habit of using Pre-thinking. This helped me improve my ability from 60 to 90% in CR. 
 
3.	Using E-GMAT Scholaranium- I was shocked after comparing my ESR sectional ability with Scholaranium ability %. To my surprise, they were identical. I then realized that Scholaranium questions and algorithm are so close to actual GMAT exam that improving my ability in Scholaranium will definitely translate to a better score in GMAT. With this in mind, I followed step by step plan laid out by E-GMAT team and could achieve my target score in ~ 30 days. 
 
4.	Practicing Full-length official mocks – I now finally understand why everyone praised Official GMAT prep mocks so much. They are the one truly reliable indicator of the score. And so, I purchased Official Mocks (3-6). And I tried a couple of strategies while giving the mock exams – such as going fast for first half, slow for first half, skipping last RC and so on. I finally found a strategy tailor made for me and finally decided to book the official GMAT. 
 
GMAT Online Experience – Although I was a bit nervous of doing the exam from my home and that too without the much-needed optional break between Quant and verbal. But I decided to go for it anyway. And to my surprise, it was a pleasant experience. Fortunately, no technical glitch, no bad experience with customer service, nothing bad happened on the test day. Finally, after 3 days of waiting I got my official score. And with a sigh of relief, I realized that after 1.5 years and 3 attempts this story’s finally over.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=96#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","I initially practiced from OG, while skimming through Manahattan Prep books. Then I took one official mock and a free Sigma X-mock from e-GMAT. The scores were a pleasant surprise and I decided that I should polish a few weak areas and should give the GMAT online within a month.

The Sigma-X mock's detailed report was in line with my own assessment and helped me identify that SC was a weak area for me and I needed to further polish my Quant ability to give my best shot. Post a strategy consultation, the e-GMAT team offered me with a special one-month subscription (basis my actual GMAT date, the team happily and promptly extended this for 2 more days). I began with SC, which was my Achilles' and where e-GMAT course helped me the most. After completing that I wasn't sure how to utilize the program as I was already at a reasonably advanced level and did not plan to study other topics from scratch. I then arranged a call with an e-GMAT mentor, Dhananjay (DJ) and he provided me with a customized plan. Further, he even scheduled regular follow-ups, which were quite helpful to track my progress and adapting the plan as needed. The discussions with Dhananjay gave me a good framework for how to structure my preparation and helped me understand how to make most of the e-GMAT course.

As for the actual course content: In verbal, I found the SC course and Scholaranium quite useful. I didn't refer at all to CR and RC concepts; for practicing these I did try Scholaranium but I felt certain CR questions were not in line with official questions and hence shifted to the Verbal OG. As for Quant, e-GMAT's questions are significantly tougher than that of OG. But if done with the right mindset, they can help you expand your approach and understanding of concepts, but one has to ensure that they don't get demoralized given that the accuracy can be lower while time taken per question would be higher.

Overall, I think the course is very detailed and would be very useful for someone who starts from scratch and invests more time. For me, the concepts felt lengthy and at times primitive. But this is where the support from the e-GMAT mentor was integral as it helped me customize the course to my needs and extract the most out of it.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=96#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

To my benefit, Egmat reached out to us for the mentorship program looking at the account history and that I have always reached out to the support team for help.
It was one of the best decisions to enroll with E-gmat for the mentorship program as while preparing, you constantly need to know whether the efforts you are putting are going in the right direction or not and the next step from there on. The mentorship program has been highly beneficial for me because of various reasons. Firstly, every week there is a day wise milestone plan made with your mentor basis your current performance and your goal. Having daily milestones is very effective as consistency is the biggest key while preparing for the Gmat exam.
Next, constant feedback is given on every quiz and every test taken. The biggest benefit for me was Dhananjay helping me out analyze my mock tests and point out error on timing, accuracy and sub sections, post analysis of performance of the previous week, the next week plan was chalked out.
Interactions with the cohort and peer learning has been another benefit. With the conducive environment created by Dhananjay, we were all able to share our experiences and help each other out. We also used to have weekly training sessions on different topics to solve common problems such as managing time, mental health, consistency etc.
Finally, Dhananjay was available to guide me all the time. I could reach out to him anytime of the day and he would just ask me to set up a zoom call and connect! For me, the biggest problem while studying GMAT is stress management. My performance throughout the study was excellent but there was always a problem on the test day due to anxiety issues while giving the test. Dhananjay helped me overcome this by making me give tests in harsh conditions (Lesser time for more difficult questions) so that I practice overcoming the panic situations as well.
On the test day, I could see a huge difference in the way I was handling questions and managing time. The idea to focus on meaning based approach in SC and the pre-thinking on CR really helped me solve the questions. I could see a huge difference in my level of preparation and confidence from the previous exam taken. Only because of getting one complete RC passage incorrect in the end, I could not score well on my Verbal section. Nonetheless, Dhananjay helped me start again by focusing only on the weak areas and improving my score further.  I am all set now to appear for another exam very soon.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=96#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","In November 2019, I took the GMAT and obtained a score of 700 (49Q,39V). Even though I had received a good score, I felt as though I could score higher. However, I realized I would benefit from an online course that would structure my learning and highlight my weak areas. I saw that e-GMAT was the most reviewed course on GMAT Club, so I did the 7-day free trial to test the course. I really liked the videos that taught the concepts since I am a visual learner. The 5 free mock exams were definitely a plus since I wouldn't have to buy practice CATs from another test prep company. As I was taking the course, I appreciated that every question on Scholarium (e-GMAT's question bank) had essentially a comments section where students asked their questions and each question had a response from an e-GMAT verified instructor. So whenever I would review my incorrect answers, I would look at the comments section and would always find my question answered. At the beginning of my course, the e-GMAT team provided me with a course strategy that would also tell me if I had truly mastered a concept or if I needed to review it. The course taught me to look at meaning in sentence correction (something I never considered) and provided me a framework for assumption, evaluate, weaken, and strengthen questions in critical reasoning. Following e-GMAT's instruction and the online course, I completed the online course by around May 2020. From there I spent about a month doing the e-GMAT mock exams and OG GMAT exams. I took the online GMAT exam at the beginning of June (before a Physical whiteboard was allowed) and scored a 720 (50Q,38V). I was slightly disappointed that I had only scored a 720 but I was glad it was better than the 700. When I informed the e-GMAT team about my 720 score, Ashutosh (from e-GMAT Customer Strategy) gave me a call. After reviewing my scores on my e-GMAT mock exams, he realized that I was capable of scoring higher than a 720. He made it clear that I should definitely retake it and that instead of studying for another few months, he came up with a tailored 10-day plan that would target my weak areas. This tailored plan was to build my stamina throughout the exam and improve my accuracy on hard level problems. After going through those 10 days of several different types of quizzes, I retook the online GMAT exam (I also had a physical whiteboard this time). Seven days later I received my score report and saw that I scored a 740 (49Q,41V). I was really happy because the hard work since November 2019 paid off. I definitely appreciate the help from e-GMAT and do recommend the course to whoever. I believe it is best to get the full course covering both Quant and Verbal so that you can also get access to the mock exams.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=96#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I started my GMAT journey in 2018. I did self-study for three weeks and went for the test just before Christmas in 2018. Scored 630 (Q44, V32). Disappointed, but with a full-time finance job that required me to work over 65 hours per week, I decided to divert my attention back to work. I have paused my MBA plan until early this year. I started self-prep again in mid-Jan. I tried out GMAT official mocks after studying for a month and scored 700 in both attempts. Not convinced by my mock scores, especially my inconsistent performance in the verbal section, I decided to sign up for a course specialized in verbal. The reviews on gmatclub for e-GMAT gave me a lot of confidence. Therefore, I decided to sign up for the full course, not only for verbal. 

*Verbal Section*
SC: great for building fundamentals, but the course is very lengthy. The meaning-based approach, unfortunately, does not always work in the actual test. I would strongly advise against relying solely on e-GMAT to prepare for verbal. The sentence structures of some of the SC questions created by them are also quite bizarre. It is easy to see that the non-native speakers wrote those sentences. 
CR: Sorry to be blunt, but the lectures created by them are quite useless. Using their approach, I guarantee most would not be able to solve the questions within 2.5 minutes. Their explanations are way too long. For those official questions, I could understand the official explanations better than their lengthy solutions. 
RC: Ancient materials. Not worth the time. 

*Quant* 
Overall: only for building fundamentals. If you are below Q40, you can use that to learn the concepts then utilize their quizzes to identify weak areas. Once you hit Q45 or above in mock, DO NOT rely solely on e-GMAT anymore. I realized a big mistake I made was not checking out other test prep companies' courses. I have almost completed all e-GMAT quant quizzes before my official tests. When I signed up for a trial of another test prep company lately, I found out many of the concepts were not taught on e-GMAT. I was only able to encounter those concepts in one or two of those e-GMAT quizzes. 

Quant Scholaranium: A great portal to identify weak areas. Really accurate because it correctly identified my weakest spot being number properties - my accuracy on number properties was only 50%; In contrast, the rest were all 85-100% in the M-H level questions in my official GMAT test. But their questions are unnecessarily long. When I did my official GMAT test recently, none of the items are THAT LONG. Even for word problems! The average time I spent on solving official quant questions are less than 1.5 minute, but e-GMAT questions could take up to 3 -4 minutes to solve! I voiced my frustration to my e-GMAT coach who followed up with my weekly progress. He asked me to give him some examples of questions that required longer than 2.5 minutes to solve. I could give him a whole list of 50+ questions honestly. But I gave him three examples. He said he would show me how to solve in 2 minutes - but guess what - he did not follow up on that! I m 100% sure no one can do that. I attempted the questions again a few times following their approach - I could even remember the approach by heart - and I still could not solve in 2 minutes. And the statistics of students who had solved these questions correctly also showed that they had to spend over 3 minutes! I am so upset by the time wasted on solving problems that do not represent the actual styles of GMAT questions. 

In summary, I utterly regret wasting time on this course. I might have been able to progress faster by taking the courses of other test prep companies. As someone who started with 700 in official mock, I feel incredibly frustrated with the zero improvements after having spent MORE THAN four months on this. The zoom calls with the coach were pointless, too - all I get is some simple advice that I can give it to myself, like reading the economists/ keeping track of time at regular intervals. I m not someone starting at 500ish. And I had been doing those things even before signing on E-GMAT.

What stunned me the most is I scored 710, and 740 in the official mocks before my official test but ended up with 640 (in test center) then 660 (online GMAT). 

I never slacked off on any day despite my demanding job- I kept error logs, reviewed mistakes kept on practicing, and followed their advice.

With such an unfortunate result after four months of dedicated work, I could only pin down to the following problems with e-GMAT: 
1) not all essential quant concepts are covered in their ""concept files""/ ""practice files""/ ""application files"" 
2) CR techniques completely not applicable in actual tests
3) SC meaningful approach does not always work 
4) Lectures are only useful for those starting with 500-650 in official mocks. Cannot help breakthrough 700 barrier, unless someone is already proficient in quant (scoring Q50-51) and only need to polish verbal a bit. 

I m sure e-GMAT might work for some, but if you are short on time, e-GMAT is not the course for you to boost the score from 600 sth to 700 or above in 1-3 months. And DO NOT rely on it to learn all concepts. Take its SC/ CR approach with a grain of salt. I have learned from pain. 

I never really want to write such a review - but I find it necessary to tell my story. These four months were incredibly crucial to me, and the time wasted could have significant repercussions on my MBA applications.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=96#","1","0","","","","","",""

Overall, egmat is a very good product for the price point. 
Verbal content ( i.e teaching methodology/ solution approach) is top-notch and helps anyone with average English excel in the Verbal section. Sharaddha (Verbal Expert) is just awesome for the fact that she answers all your queries succinctly. 
Quants has good content (I didn't extensively use the video lessons). 
The Scholaranium (question bank) is a must have. It helps one master the Quants section (if you practice all questions at least twice!). 
Questions are GMAT quality. 
Sigma-X (Mocks) truly reveals once potential.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","My GMAT story started in October 2019 with my initial score 520 (Manhattan tests). Following the advice of my friend, I started my prep using MGMAT books. Though I thoroughly went through almost all the books in the collection, diligently doing all exercises, by the end of March 2020 I could not score above 540. Along the way, I also solved a ton of OG questions, almost exhausting the question bank in OG, OG Verbal and OG Quant. 

Definitely, something was drastically wrong in my prep and I needed professional help. After analyzing most popular courses and reading a number of debriefs, I decided to stay with E-Gmat. 

My journey with E-Gmat started with construction of a study plan for the entire course based on my initial score. What I liked about E-gmat plan is that every GMAT area needs to be covered in sequence. I clearly missed this point in my previous prep, and in a single day I could study Sentence Correction and Algebra, the approach that was obviously wrong.  My pleasant surprises with E-gmat did not end at this point and I was admitted to E-Gmat mentorship program, which is basically study assistance by professional live GMAT instructor. Along with study plan developed by the E-gmat system, my mentor, Archit, every week was developing for me a detailed plan for the coming week, in which he stated what exact areas I needed to study and how many hours. Such a structured approach is very motivational and pushes you to study consistently with no pauses. What is more valuable is that Archit analyzed my progress and pointed when I needed to return back and to learn a concept again. Doing so, he made sure that I did not leave spaces in my conceptual understanding.  

As for the E-gmat course itself, it is very self-sufficient so that you don’t need any other books or materials. For every topic, it has brilliant videos, which teach all the concepts needed for GMAT. But the best thing was that after learning a concept, you watch a video showing how this concept is used in the context of GMAT like questions and how to solve these questions with a step-by-step guide. Finally, you are offered a quiz to cement your knowledge and skills. Only upon successful solving the quiz, you are allowed to move further. Thus, bit by bit, the course builds your GMAT abilities. Going along the way, I understood that I had had a lot of flaws in my conceptual knowledge and totally wrong approach in application of those concepts. 

My study plan was designed for 3 months, from April to June, and on June 17 I took my first attempt. Even though my official mocks showed the result of 700-710 (my target score), I could score only 630. I believe the test center experience played a major role in spoiling my score, since I was required to wear face mask and gloves, which brought a lot of discomfort and distractions. As for the questions, there were pretty similar to official mock tests and E-gmat tests, with the exception of RC passages, which turned out to be more complicated and were all from Humanities, my weakest area. 

Right after the test, Archit analyzed my ESR report and immediately designed new study plan for the next 20 days, till the next attempt. This time the plan set forth the task of solving quizzes containing only hard questions and diligent work with the error log. No new learning was needed. 
On July 9, in my second attempt I scored 680. Even though, I did not hit my target, I still possess very good chances for enrolling my dream business school, which now depend on other criteria. All in all, I could achieve 140 points improvement within 3 months from end of March (540 – Manhattan mock) to beginning of July (680 – real test). 

I would like to express my gratitude to all who stand behind E-gmat project and sincerely thank my mentor, Archit, who was very attentive to my progress and provided with priceless advices along the way. I want to thank Rajat and Payal for creating it all and designing brilliant classes and materials. May your project flourish so that you continue to change life of many many students, who previously struggled with GMAT!

																			by score report","Points","Location","Whether you're starting to get into GMAT prep or you've been at it for a while, you might be struggling with figuring out which learning path to follow, how to improve your score in less time or how to prevent repeating mistakes. 

After a year of trying to prepare for the GMAT aimlessly, I was pretty frustrated with all the material out there. Why wasn't there anything that took me from point A to point B without so many detours in the middle? 

I found out about e-GMAT on gmatclub, and I bought the GMAT Online (Quant + Verbal) course. 

I wasn't expecting much. My first GMAT mock score was 560, so I'd more or less accepted that I wasn't made for standardised tests. 

E-gmat has a feature that lets you make a study plan, so I kind of let the software take the reins and tell me what to do. 

It's a game changer. There's finally a map you can use to navigate GMAT prep. 

The GMAT journey isn't easy, no matter what test prep company you choose, but after trying so many resources, I found that e-gmat was the best at removing vagueness around the preparation process. 

Seriously, if you have a phobia of standardised tests like me, e-gmat is great at guiding you. 

If you look at questions in the OG and then you look at the solution and you think, ""Well, how am I supposed to know that I have to use this approach?"" then take e-gmat's free trial. I'm pretty sure you'll be hooked.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Instructor","I started my GMAT journey one year ago - July 2019. I just graduated college. I started off using Manhattan Prep's books. I thought studying 2 hours a day from the book and doing the books’ problems were enough but boy was I wrong. I took my first GMAT around November and at that time was shocked at how poorly I did. I knew I needed a new method. I started to take official prep tests and continued on my self studies. I took the GMAT again in March and was also disappointed. I knew that this time I needed help. I have always independently studied for exams during college and so asking for help took me off guard but it was one of the smartest decisions I made to improve my gmat score.  
I started to browse gmat club and looked into more resources. As I was looking through gmat club forums I noticed that egmat provided very clear and useful answers to many of these questions. I also signed up for one of e-gmat’s free weekend webinars. I was impressed with the instructors tips and wanted more! I signed up for their emails and luckily was approached by a tutor via email. We scheduled a time to chat and I instantly knew this was the program for me. 
I was asked to take a mock test on their platform and on the 1-1 chat I was given a mock diagnosis. It made me realize that succeeding on the GMAT is more than just understanding the tested concepts. Doing well on the GMAT requires strong ""procedural"" knowledge. It requires time management, mental stamina, and efficient approaches. I learned that conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge come hand in hand. If you strengthen your conceptual knowledge you are able to make quicker decisions on the GMAT and also strengthen your test taking abilities to complete questions accurately and on time. My biggest weakness on the GMAT was not finishing on time and leaving for example only 5 minutes for 7 questions at the end. 
The E-GMAT mentorship program was more than what I could ask for. The mentorship program is organized in a peer group fashion lead by one e-gmat instructor. My instructor was DJ. Once a week DJ and I would chat virtually and discuss what is going well, not going well, and a game plan for that week. Evaluating best next steps, DJ would then send me my milestones for each day of that week. A milestone for example was completing 5-6 sections of the e-gmat course and reaching 80% on the concept questions. These milestones were a game changer. Having a benchmark to measure myself against a) motivated me to complete the necessary daily preparation and b) set me up to challenge myself to higher standards. I also appreciate DJ's patience and encouragement. DJ was always happy to answer my questions and even encouraged me to reach out to him more frequently! He was very responsive and considerate as he would even work later to accommodate our differing time zones. DJ was also very honest with me and I knew he had my best interests in mind. Further, each Sunday the cohort would meet virtually to discuss GMAT strategies. We also had a running whats’app group in which we all would share best practices, questions and solutions. I built relationships with a few of my peers, helping one another with our weak spots. 
Overall, the e-gmat mentorship allowed me to effectively tackle the gmat. E-gmat provided me with the peer support to motivate me to stay in the game and the resources to build a strong time management approach and stamina to leverage my conceptually knowledge to do well on the gmat.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","2","0","","","","","",""

You can sort on easy, medium, or hard and number of questions. For each question missed, it shows you a video or explanation about how to go through the process of figuring out the correct answer, not just giving you the correct answer. I found this very helpful because instead of meaningless practice, it helped establish the correct procedure to develop a plan to attack the questions on the real test. The timer and suggested times also help you learn to pace yourself. I am yet to retake the GMAT test but after spending two months, I believe that I will be able to improve on my last score.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Instructor","The Mentorship program allowed me to be consistent in my preparation. The GMAT tests on a wide variety of subjects and one can get scattered in their preparation. In fact, I had a GMAT version of FOMO while studying: I would be working on geometry and then think that I need to be working on SC only to open CR guide… it has been helpful to have a trustworthy mentor 1-with good grasp of the content, 2-who can analyze my scores and 3- then suggest a study plan accordingly.
Furthermore, the weekly plans DEFINITELY improved my consistency giving me a checklist to challenge every week, even when it didn’t seem I could pull it off. I did not have to dedicate little time that I had on strategizing my preparation; I would just have to look at my daily tasks and start working. This allowed me to make the most of the e-GMAT resources within the timespan I had to prepare.
The mentorship program also entailed Strategy Huddles (zoom meetings) with themes spanning from motivation, success stories, mental health, work organization, study tips... and we had a Whatsapp group to stay in touch with the cohort, share questions, discuss solutions and encourage & congratulate each other. The community feeling definitely helped.
Finally, my mentor arranged a call the day before the exam for the last min prep, motivation and test-taking strategies.
For all the reasons above, and if you want to make sure you cover all the aspects of GMAT prep, I highly recommend the e-GMAT course & mentorship program.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","I’d like to start by thanking my instructor, Deepak Bansal, and E-GMAT for assisting me with achieving my GMAT target score and bringing me one step closer to my dream school.

I joined E-GMAT mentorship program after a long year of studying for the GMAT exam. Initially, I aimed to send my application in 2019, but because I failed to achieve an acceptable GMAT score I pushed my application to 2020.  When I started, I was all over the place – I purchased books of 3-4 different companies and mixed them all up. I did not have a firm strategy and my biggest weakness was consistency. After about 8 months of ups and downs, I decided to try enrolling E-GMAT course, which, in a hindsight, was a game-changer for me.

Soon after signing up for the E-GMAT course, I happened to speak with Deepak Bansal, an aspiring instructor of E-GMAT, who analyzed my situation and gave me some insightful advice. I realized how inefficient I was with my study plan. Soon thereafter, along with several students from all over the world, I joined E-GMAT Mentorship programs under Deepak’s supervision. 

Even though I’m a young professional who works 5 days a week, Deepak assisted me with committing and studying on a daily basis. Some of my biggest challenges were:
*Consistency – to study on a regular basis without pauses
*Organizing – to have a game plan in terms of what to study every day
*Feedback – to understand what do I do right and what do I have to improve
Deepak assisted me with each of those challenges by providing me with a study plan and a time schedule that fits my lifestyle. This schedule was updated from one week to another based on my achievements.

On test day I felt I was very prepared. I was confident in my skills and I knew I can achieve a high score. Eventually, I successfully scored 710 (Q50 / V46), which is 70 points higher than the first official score I received and more than 100 points higher than the first several mocks I took. This is a huge achievement for me and I feel that Deepak and E-GMAT have a significant role in my journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","3","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Instructor","My journey with e-GMAT began in the beginning of March, 2020. After having done extensive research on GMAT Club, I came to the conclusion that 2-3 months of solid prep should be enough for my target score of 750. After giving the first mock test, I realised that I was weak in the verbal section (Especially SC) and needed assistance. I looked over the reviews for online courses on GMAT Club and concluded that e-GMAT would be the perfect fit for me.

For most part of March, I casually solved questions from the OG and went through some of the SC material at e-GMAT. While the material was really good, I was not very confident in my ability to apply the concepts yet. That is when I received a call from Ashutosh at e-GMAT who asked me if I'd be interested in sort of a group mentorship program wherein I'd receive more personal attention. He had gone through one of my mocks and said that by working together we could get my score to reach that 750 mark. I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did. 

For the next 2 months, Ashutosh crafted personalised weekly plans for me and constantly pushed me to achieve those targets. He helped me realise the value of cementing the concepts first rather than aimlessly attempting a large number of questions. My confidence in SC increased considerably as I then began to cement my concepts through the Scholaranium questions on e-GMAT.  Scholaranium is a wonderful platform with a wide array of challenging questions and it certainly helped me get a better understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. In addition to this, the performance of my peers in the mentorship group motivated me to improve further. With the mentorship, I followed a more focused and well crafted path to my target score.

One of the biggest advantages of this program is that your mentor is always there to solve any queries you might have and will give you personalised attention. All my mock attempts were carefully analysed and I was suggested areas where there was scope for improvement. My performance in the mocks improved and I became increasingly confident heading in to the test. I took 8 mocks and the scores read : 710,730,770,770 (Sigma-X), 730 and 760 (GMAT Prep), 710 (MGMAT) and 730 (Kaplan). 

On the D-Day, I was certainly more relaxed than I had expected to be. Since Quant was my strong suit, I attempted that first. Things went fine till I encountered the first few questions on the verbal section. Not being able to solve the first 3-4 questions, I flustered and ended up wasting time unnecessarily. Luckily, this panic mode did not last long and I was able to get myself back on track. Following the time management techniques recommended to me by e-GMAT helped me a lot.  As I finished my test, I was incredibly satisfied to see myself achieve my target score of 750. Yes, I was perhaps a tad disappointed I didn't get a V40+ but achieving the 750 mark was the aim all along and I had pulled it off. All that hard work had paid off. 

All in all, I benefited greatly from e-GMAT and its mentorship program. I would certainly recommend e-GMAT to anyone who is serious about cracking the GMAT.

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Bit of a background of my GMAT attempts-
Attempt 1: Jul  2018- 680 (Q49, V33)
Attempt 2: Jun 2020- 680 (Q49, V32)
Attempt 3: Jul  2020- 740 (Q49, V42)
Yes, I did score the same even after 2 years. More of it in the sections below

For my second (and third) attempt I started my GMAT prep in Feb’20 and I was sold on to go with e-GMAT on the basis of sheer number of positive reviews that it has from non-native English speakers. I referred to only e-GMAT material and Official Guides for my preparation.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that e-GMAT provides a custom generated study plan for you. This became the corner stone of my preparation. In absence of a proper plan, I would end up spending hours without realising if I am going in the right direction. Although this worked for me for almost a month, I slipped on the preparation due to an official commitment which lasted for more than 2 weeks. I had lost my steam and was finding it difficult to focus my energy on GMAT prep.

Right when I needed it the most, in Apr’20 week 1, I was sent an exclusive invite to the e-GMAT Mentorship Program. It was a pilot that e-GMAT was doing with select students, based on its interactions with them on various query forums. It happened to be free for us. Only thing asked of us was honest feedback for the program, and we were offered- 1:1 Consultations with a dedicated mentor, custom milestone-driven study schedule, weekly feedbacks and course correction, strategy sessions, and admission consultation. Although I have not experienced admission consulting part fully, I can surely say that this program is all one needs to prepare for GMAT. This program hits the sweet spot between online preparation and 1:1 teaching, and delivers way beyond what one would expect. 

I will cover my experience with e-GMAT Mentorship Program as a lot of reviews have already covered the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of e-GMAT curriculum, and I completely agree with them. Some details on the various offerings of the Mentorship Program -
1. 1:1 Consultations with a dedicated mentor-  The program starts with a kick-off discussion with assigned mentor to understand the student's background, needs and aspirations. E-GMAT or Official Mock Test are recommended to understand areas requiring focus.
For me, Dhananjay (DJ) was my mentor, and I would say that I was lucky to have him as my mentor. He could really understand my issues well and guide me each and every time.

2. Weekly Study Plans- While an algorithm-generated study plan is a basic feature of e-GMAT, the Weekly Study Plans are actually made by an experienced mentor to suit your requirements. These have details of what you need to do on each day of the week. The plan would include minutest of details such as doing specific sections of the e-GMAT curriculum, taking mocks, debriefing mocks or even reading articles from specific sources.

3. Weekly feedback and course correction: Mentor takes weekly calls with the student to understand the progress made during the week, personally guide on any issues that the student faced during the week, identify any red flags in the preparation, and plan the further course of action. 
While it may seem as a very basic exercise from what I have explained, believe me, the mentor goes extra mile to make sure that you are on track and motivated all along the journey. In my case, DJ reviewed my progress, at times more than once a week, and provide very detailed feedback that I would have never been able to make out on my own. He reviewed my performance on mocks, conducted detailed debriefs to understand the exact problem areas, and even guided me in understanding newspaper articles to strengthen my RC ability.

4. Strategy Sessions- As a part of the e-GMAT Mentorship Program, you are part of a 10-15 student cohort under a dedicated mentor. Topics like time management, success stories of ex-students, stress management, online GMAT features, etc. are covered by the mentor in the Strategy Sessions. These sessions are undertaken at a frequency of 1-2 per month. 

5. Admissions Consultation- I had limited experience on this front as I chose to get done with my GMAT prep first. Basically, e-GMAT connects you to a pool of select consultants to kick-start your discussions on applications. 

Coming to my performance on D-day(s) -

A week before my GMAT exam in June, I was consistently scoring 720-740 on all mocks- OG, e-GMAT and GC. However, I got a shocker when I scored 680 after 4 months of preparation and after getting all the personal guidance. I was in a kind of an emotional shock and lost hope on taking GMAT again. 

It was this moment when I realised how much a mentor can help you get back and prepare to face the exam again. DJ was instrumental in pushing me to retake the GMAT within 15 days and in guiding me even more aggressively, almost on a daily basis. He analysed my ESR and identified clear areas of concern and how to address each one of them. The kind of feedback I got within 6 hours of receiving my ESR was phenomenal. We identified that I had spent disproportionate amount of time on first 15 questions in Verbal and that I needed to strengthen my CR ability. I guess, I would have been lost if I were left on my own after scoring a 680. 

In my next attempt in July’20, I was more confident and had a clear strategy defined on how to approach the test. I could clearly see the difference this mentorship program made and helped me achieve 740 on GMAT.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=97#","1","0","","","","","",""

CR – the section has detailed concepts on identifying Premise, Conclusion, etc. It is a must-do, leaves no scope for confusion while attempting questions. I was able to improve my performance from the 45th percentile to the 94th percentile.

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi, my name is Gary. I am 25 years old and I have 3 years working experience in a retail company in Indonesia as a Business Analyst. First time I studied GMAT was in September 2019. I studied hard by myself through free resources for 4 months until I took my first GMAT test in December 2019, scoring 550 (Q42,V24). This score was not enough for me to apply to any business schools I want. After that, I studied for TOEFL and got a good score in January 2020. In February 2020, I decided to deal with GMAT again but with a different strategy. I searched for the best online preparation platform in the internet and I chose e-gmat and here was the beginning of my journey.

The most astonishing part of e-gmat platform was the step-by-step approach strategy to finish a question. I realized that the failure of my previous test was due to lack of strategical approach to answer the questions. I only used brute force and pure logical thinking to answer each question. GMAT will give you a hard time if you just using pure logic to answer the questions. Yes it is true that what is tested in GMAT is our logic, but with a right method, we can answer many more questions with much higher accuracy. The strategies taught by e-gmat was easy to understand and applicable in each question, and was served in an interactive videos. We just need to simply follow the sequences given my e-gmat. The team has already designed the courses in the best way a student can learn. 

Another highlight features of e-gmat was the Scholaranium, Mock Test, and Course Correction. The Scholaranium helps the students to cement the methods learned, thus we can practice our newly learned process in this bank of questions. We can track our progress, determine our strong and weak areas, and review each questions with complete explanations. After we finish practicing in Scholaranium, we can move to Mock Test, a simulation of the real GMAT Test. In this part, we can get the summary of our performances, which is very important for our evaluation and track record to reach the target score. Lastly, the free course correction by Mr. Deepak was so beneficial for me. He helped me to analyze my Mock Test, determined my weak areas, and gave me the solutions step by step for me to follow. 

Actually I want to take GMAT test in late April, but because of Covid-19 situation, I took GMAT on June. I could not take Online GMAT because of technical issues (failed twice). After several months grinding, I finally took my GMAT Test on 10th June 2020 and guess what? I got 660 (Q48, V34)!!! 

My weak area is surely Verbal part, and I spend a lot of time refining my Verbal skills in e-gmat. Surely e-gmat has a very great verbal section so that I can improve from V24 to V34. Finally, I want to give my biggest thanks for Mr. Deepak and the rest of e-gmat team because finally I reach my target score.
Good luck to all of you for the GMAT Test!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=98#","1","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Instructor","Overall I found my e-gmat experience really rewarding as I was able to improve my verbal score from V33 to V41 by following their structured approach to each question type on verbal section.
I feel to score good on GMAT, two things are really important – one is to have good fundamental understanding of the concepts and the other is to follow the correct approach. This course is structured in a way which will help you in getting good at both of these aspects. Their focus on approach and fundamentals in every single lesson will help you ingrain it in your mind.
Personally for me the SC was something which I wanted to improve upon as my current approach of splitting options into groups of 2/3 was not panning out. Therefore, I tried out their 3 step approach for SC questions. At the start, it was really difficult to follow this approach. But if you give yourself time, it can do wonders like it did for me and many others.
e-gmat helped me overachieve my target score of 730-740 and get admits from multiple schools. I would 100% recommend this course to everyone who want to improve their verbal score, enabling them to get closer to their MBA dream.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=98#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","Hi all,
Hope your preparations are going well!

I'll just get straight to the points about how e-GMAT helped me
1. The only problem I had was with verbal. I knew the basics of the language but didn't know the exact rules. Doing this course helped fill those knowledge gaps and make a foundation to work upon. This was important when I was down to 2-3 choices and I needed a concrete rule to decide the answer
2. For practice, I used to take pictures of the summary slides and the practice problem that I got wrong. I used to go through these pictures anytime I was free. While revising I used the remember where I went wrong. Since I have the habit of forgetting small rules and points, this practice style helped a lot.
3. Scholaranium really helped to gauge my levels of understanding of different sections. The easy/medium/hard selection for ""cementing quiz"" is a great way to do this. 


4. Having a strong quant background, I didn't use the quant section, so I can't say anything about that. But judging from how well they've made the verbal section, I'd bet the quant section is awesome as well.
5. This might be irrelevant now given that GMAT online has allowed scratchpad - if you plan on using the whiteboard feature, I would advise practicing for at least a week. You can also use the whiteboard to cover the answers before you're done with your pre-thinking (e-GMAT).
6. GMAT online is not as scary as some people think. It went very smoothly. The comfort of the home gives an edge to the test taker. Be prepared for some glitches(in my case the exam window closed for 2-3 minutes before coming back on. NO, O DIDN'T LOSE ANY TIME. IT WAS RESUMED ON THE POINT THE WINDOW GOT CLOSED).
7. I wasn't able to take mock tests after completing the course due to time constraints (i finished my course 4 days before the exam. I used cementing quizzes to target my areas of weakness.) But I did use them 2 times before the course and they are pretty accurate. The analytics also help to understand where exactly is your weakness.

General advice-
a. try to complete the course learning at least 2 weeks before your test date. Give yourself 1 week to work on cementing quizzes then another week for the mocks.
b. BE CONSISTENT. e-GMAT provides a perfect tool for creating a plan for your target score. STICK TO THAT PLAN. If you are ahead of schedule go ahead and do some extra work. Better to have some extra time in the end. Keep in mind that while making the plan exclude the 2 weeks mentioned in the last point for self-testing.

Finally, I would say that GMAT is hard when you don't approach it with a proper strategy. With proper knowledge and practice, good scores are easily achievable.

Good luck with your upcoming exams!
I hope you all achieve high scores!!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=98#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by score report","Points","Location","I decided to take GMAT in December 2019 and took a few mocks to gauge my initial level. I scored about 730-740 in most of these but wasn’t really sure about my strengths and weaknesses. Targeting a 750+, I researched about GMAT prep and signed up for e-GMAT. I didn’t use a lot of their course material so I would keep my review limited to their Exam Prep : Scholaranium and list out some tips to use its complete potential.

During the initial days, I had this strong urge to take a lot of practice quizzes (I hear it’s pretty common). However, Payal’s pre-recorded videos were very helpful in planning my schedule. She has created a set of videos which will cater to test takers at different levels of preparedness. And are quite insightful, if one takes the time to review them.

Now about Scholaranium : It essentially is a cluster of questions and tests meant to seal concepts and give a ‘GMAT-like’ experience. It’s important to use the tool while referring to Payal’s videos otherwise one wouldn’t get much out of the preparation. There are ample amount of questions of all possible difficulty levels and e-GMAT helps you set target score thresholds for each. This helps bring about a smooth progress while you seal your 1) concepts and 2) test taking strategy.

Finally, about my actual GMAT experience. In my first attempt I scored a 730 which was an improvement of 0 points from my first e-gmat mock. I would have settled for the score but figured I needed to up it a few notches. It was then that I met Rajat online and his two cents pushed me to re-take in 2 weeks and I ended up with a 760. Rajat has a good amount of experience in test prep and for once I trusted him and took a blind plunge with just about a week of refining my test taking strategy.

Overall, e-GMAT is a holistic support system for test takers if they follow the model with discipline. They have a responsive support group too that folks should leverage more to their benefit.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=98#","2","0","","","","","",""

I had doubt about enrolling at first as I didn't want to waste time given that the applications are coming close.

I took the leap and it worked! I learned that meaning is very important that grammatical rules (sentences that are grammatically correct can be wrong as the meaning doesn't make sense).

I didn't have enough time to study reading comprehension and critical reasoning as my exam date was in 1-2 weeks. 

Prior to egmat, I was somewhat guessing between the remaining 2-3 choices in a question in sentence correction. By end of the course (and with good effort from my side), I aced the GMAT's SC part (I applied for detailed report from GMAT website to view this).

I wish that egmat can grant longer durations instead of the 6 months (but the duration is good enough if you work (at a company) for less that 55 hours a week. In my case, the project delivery was coming to an end, and I had to find time to study.

I already recommended my best friends for egmat's online courses. It would be great if they have a referral program!

																			by score report","Points","Location","I stumbled upon eGMAT while looking for some strategies from previous test takers to boost your GMAT score. I was overwhelmed by the amazing things eGMAT students had to say about the course and how it helped them structure their GMAT preparation. This really resonated with me since I was struggling with keeping a clear track of my preparation. I decided to attend an eGMAT webinar on pre-thinking for CR and that's when I knew that I was going to enroll into their course.

At first, I bought the Verbal online package and absolutely loved the focus on the basics. It's funny how much you can forget what you've learned in school and that became quite evident when I started the verbal course. What I found to be particularly useful was the blend of concept and strategy  that eGMAT offered. I feel that very few, if any, GMAT prep companies offer this and thanks to eGMAT's pedagogy these strategies become second nature.

eGMAT's program definitely requires patience and though there were times I didn't understand why things were explained in such a detailed manner, it was essential to internalize the concepts and strategies. 

Lastly, I feel that the eGMAT Quant prep is highly underrated. I never felt challenged by GMAT Quant but never managed to get to a Q50. It was only after going through Quant part of eGMAT that I managed to hit Q50 (despite the online whiteboard) so I definitely recommend not skipping the Quant section unless you are a math genius.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=98#","0","0","","","","","",""

The interface is flash player based and very very awkward to work with it may seem that this is a petty point but it does matter when you want to revise a section. The topics are not searchable the table of contents is not good. The quant questions are quite tough, probably more than actual GMAT. For each and every question e-gmat has long explanations and that may seem a good thing about it it becomes a nuisance when you are just looking for one small thing that got you wrong, and you have to read a 2 page explanation.

The CR part was excellent in terms of understanding the different parts of an argument, the different kinds of questions that can be asked and mainly getting to know the traps involved in official GMAT questions. The RC course was good for learning the way to understand any given passage, and increasing retention while reading anything.
Quant could be helpful for people who have lost touch with the subject.
The mock tests from e-gmat and GMATclub, combined with other tests (Veritas, Manhattan) are probably enough when you have an understanding of the Official guide.

Though my official GMAT score was less than expected, as I was scoring 720-740 in mocks but it got me admitted to my dream college. For this, I want to thank GMAT Club and it's awesome members. There are people at GMAT Club who have explained every concept very beautifully.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=100#","3","0","","","","","",""

Although it started with very basic concepts at first, which I skimmed through, once it got to the complicated concepts the rules were really helpful.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I would like to highlight the 3 important sections of the whole course.

1. Roadmap: e-gmat allows students to create a course roadmap as per their tentative GMAT exam date highlighting the number of hours to be invested in each section as per their target scores.  Thus, at the very start, I was able to visualize and plan the kind of preparation I wanted.

2. Course material: Verbal: One word, Awesome! This course was precise and interlinked in terms of the topics. Within SC, the gradual progression of topics ensured that by the end of SC each portion was well understood.  I was able to identify the areas where I was going wrong and improve on them through practice in Scholaranium.  Similarly, the methodology of understanding small portions (2-3 sentences) in each para, creating a summary of each para and then consolidating the summary to create a passage summary was the step-by-step approach that I needed to learn RC.Quant: The quant course covered right from the basics of primes and divisibility tests to the advanced topics of probability and PnC in a detailed manner. For revision, I found the pace of videos tad slow but for freshers, the pace might be appropriate.
3. Guidance: Most importantly, the e-gmat team is extremely supportive and helpful in clarifying your doubts.  I was able to receive a lot of personal guidance from them whenever I needed, right from the course correction to the post-admit program selection.  I'm thankful to Rajat and Sharang for giving their time and for helping me in my journey.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=100#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","If like me, you are troubled by the idea of where to start and how to go about things, I would recommend taking a look at e-gmat and their personal planner. After going through a lot of free trials (you can browse gmatclub and you will find at least 6-7)

I opted for e-GMAT primarily for the following reasons.

1. The personal planner. I input my starting score, it asked my target score, how many hours I can spare and when I planned on taking the test and out came this timetable that was perfect for me, a 3-4 month calendar with a daily breakdown of modules
2. The course structure was systematic and aligned with the schedule; I no longer needed to think what to do; it was all planned and laid out.
3. The approach, test yourself without any concept, go through the concept with solved
examples, test your improvement, rinse, and repeat.
4. The cost. One of the more economical options with similar reviews as others

Quantitative: Simple yet elegant. 

The e-GMAT modules are very intuitive and the structure of the course is perfect to get you up and running from scratch.

There are no short cuts here, at least in the beginning, but you can take solace in the fact that if you do walk the road, it leads to the same destination. The only thing you need to do for Quant is to go through the entire syllabus, focus on the fundamental concepts, and practice away to kingdom come.

My rhythm was to follow e-GMAT down to the letter, I crossed every t and dotted every i it did not matter if I was good at something already if the course needed me to do something I did it. Test before concept, learn the concept, practice on e-GMAT questions, practice on OG questions, next
topic, rinse, repeat.

After completing a module (say Number properties), I would go to Scholarium (don't try topronounce this, I gave up) and attempt the questions there, failed miserably in the beginning, but moved on to the next module. When I completed all the modules, I took a book and made my notes
for each chapter with all the essential formulae, information, and possible tricks/methods.

Verbal: Focus on the meaning and don't chase tricks

Initially, I was not comfortable with the e-GMAT SC but that was because I was not patient and was looking to rush ahead. I had to go back to e-GMAT, and I changed my approach. I was going to go through the concepts alone and not solve questions. I focused on the meaning now rather than trying to find a trick to solve the question.

Even though my CR and RC were strong I still completed all the modules in e-GMAT, and it took me a total of 30 days to complete Verbal. Like Quant, I made my notes. Although not as polished as Quant, these were lifesavers.

Verbal SC, forget the tricks initially, focus on understanding the meaning. Once you understand
the meaning, you can go back and now compartmentalize it into methods (maybe). Rely heavily on
gmatclub forums for the official questions, some amazing community answers that can help you
reinforce your concepts or even help you discover new ways of solving SC questions.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the course because it provides you with the tools to lay a very solid foundation. How high you build on top of-course depends on you.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=100#","0","0","","","","","",""

In my experience, I did much better when I meticulously followed the course structure; If you have the time, don't cut corners, I saw that a negligence towards the RC section of the course instantly resulted on a poor performance on test day. My second attempt was a direct result of practicing E-GMAT RC and using scholaranium to perfect ability.
The ability quizzes are great in terms of their measurement of section- based readiness. Take them routinely, especially if you haven't touched a topic for a while. Unfortunately for me, they introduced the Official Guide Scholaranium just as I took my attempts. This also seems super interesting, purely because OG explanations can be really bad sometimes, and applying the E-GMAT framework to most question types makes for a more structured approach to the solution, had it been present when I first started out, I definitely would’ve made it my only directory.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=100#","1","0","","","","","",""

I have only purchased the verbal part, as I used MathRevolution for quant. The curriculum is well structured and the platform is for most of it parts very user friendly (I think some content has been updated while some part are still using an old style which is less interactive and visually appealing). What I struggled the most with it is basically the e-gmat verbal approach that just did not stick with me. It is quite theoretical and provides a grammatical reasoning for most of the questions. It is also quite extensive as it requires to follow a long list of potential errors to check. So if you are that kind of person that tackles the verbal section with a grammar book than this course might be the right fit. As i mentioned in my GMAT debrief, a good way to understand whether this is the right course for you is to check the expert solutions / replies on the gmat forum.  If you like the way the e-gmat expert explain / tackle a question, then go for the course. 
Worth to mention, they have a very solid question bank called scholarium and I think the mock tests are really good.

Pro:
- comprehensive course
- solid question bank with a lot of analysis functionality
- good value for money

Contra:

																			by score report","Points","Location","My experience with GMAT like many others has been rewarding in more ways than through just hitting my target score, and humbling too. So for all those retakers out there, hang in there and keep at it. 

Initial Prep and first attempt
Like many other people, i started my prep with an outddated set of Manhattan PDFs - both for quant and verbal. While these helped lay decent foundations to build on, they never gave me an honest chance at hitting my minimum desired score of 730. After a couple of months of prep with a performance of 690-700 in my official mocks - i was sorely disappointed as the screen flashed an abysmal 640 (Q47, V31). Frustrated but determined to keep at it, I began assessing my next steps.

E-gmat Verbal Online - A meticulous and structured approach to Verbal Prep
Honestly speaking, I had trust issues with all the online courses out there - sometimes it's hard to separate the hardcore marketing campaigns from the genuine value for courses out there competing with one another. But after much deliberation and thorough evaluation of reviews, I decided to take the decision to purchase the E-gmat verbal online course,which eventually proved insturmental in hitting that V40. To begin with ESR revealed my sentence correction to be at a decent V37, while my RC and CR were at a terrible V29.

CR - Laying the foundations
The E-gmat CR course is in my humble opinion an absolute gem. Sure, it definitely takes time and effort to gain mastery, but it's worth it if you're focusing on a seriously big jump in CR. The course has a style that suited my method of study - It was heavily visual, interactive throughout and provided an almost annoying number of feedback touchpoints - as i discovered through the course, this works in the long run to really ingrain and retain the fundamentals. The pre and post quizzes provide an excellent mechanism to nail down which areas you're lacking in at the time. The way the course is structured helps gradually pick up the fundamentals module by module (e.g. Inference first to lay down the ground rules which are applicable to future modules as well, an incremental learning system). And last and far from being the least - the focus on the pre-thinking approach helps overcome the biases and subsequent traps that spring up on reading answer choices right after the stimulus. Call it what you want, but ingraining the process of spending a moment on the core of the argument is invaluable, it makes navigating the answer choices a breeze for a lot of questions that may have stumped you peviously.

SC - Plugging the gaps 
While SC was something that I pretty much ironed out through assessment of my error log, E-gmat helped plug a few fundamental issues when faced with roadblocks. The summaries at the end of modules helped retain key pointers that added more structure to my repertoire and crucially increased my confidence to hit v40. 

RC - A surprising find 
I did not really focus on my RC techniques in my second attempt - beyond regularly practising official passages. More on the surprise later. 

My second attempt
As the test date neared, my official mocks fluctuated from 700 to 720. While a neutral 690 flashed on the screen, the marked improvement proved that I'd done something right, though clearly it wasn't enough yet. My verbal improved from V31 to V37, which was what i was hitting in my mocks in verbal. The ESR revealed a improvement in accuracy, but serious time management issues were my undoing. 

Prep for My third attempt
I settled in for what i told myself would be my final attempt - I did not even book my date this time! I reviewed the CR courses once more, revised my SC cheat sheet every 4-5 days and double clicked on RC so to speak. 
I realized that the pre-thinking approach in the CR modules had slowly been impacting my RC performance positively, over time. The fundmanetals of reading and pre-thinking applied to both CR and RC - while this was great, I still had to tackle my time management issues. At this point, I simplified my strategy for the same - 15-15-15-20 (For each set of 9 Q), this rough strategy meant I had enough time to make up for any lag in my time management, and to account for harder questions slowing me towards the middle of the spectrum. Now here's where E-gmat saved the day for me - their scholaranium allows you to take verbal ability quizzes. 

Scholaranium
They're a simulation of the verbal section, a sectional test, and what stands out is the quality of their questions - they're as close as they come to the real GMAT verbal questions, even if they may feel a little different. What i found was that my Verbal Ability quiz results (percentile scores) were pretty much within 1-2 points of the my official mock scores (which i had exhuasted by time, but a retake of an old mock whose questions I'd entirely forgotten proved this.) I was consistently hitting the V42 level on the ability quiz while managing my time well, and this gave me immense confidence to walk in and just give it my best shot on the final day. 

Test Day
As you've read elsewhere, regular meditation and exercise helps stay focused with your eyes on the prize. So a good routine (and peaceful sleep) and no distractions from the same on the d-day proved invaluable to my test score. I felt I'd messed up my quant a little, but had no time to dwell on the same. Hitting the reset button in my head, I attacked the verbal section with an almost arrogant air, letting go of questions when required and guessing smartly when possible. When the score flashed a 730 (Q49 V40), I was elated, though slightly disappointed with my quant score. Nevertheless, it was an exercise in grit, letting go of arrogance to take help through an online course and trusting myself to deliver on the final day.  

Value for Rekaters 
The highlight for retakers is that E-gmat allows you to extend your course for a flat, affordable fee that makes renewing your course a no-brainer.
 
Final Thoughts
All said and done, the only thing that really matters on test day is the question in front of you and an awareness of the time remaining in each section - this greatly simplifies the mental complexity and stress that accompanies most exam takers on D-day. 
Hope this long read has helped, good luck!","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=101#","4","1","","","","","",""

The methodical approach taught by Payal is very intuitive and builds upon the basics step by step. The end of each section concept with official GMAT questions is really helpful in bolstering the concepts learned in the previous lessons. The curriculum for CR is also designed in a way that one  instinctively thinks of an assumption before answering any CR question. Once you are familiar with this approach, mastering CR becomes much more easier. Furthemore, Payal also helped analyze my ESR and her timely inputs helped me improve my score in a short period of time. My heartfelt thanks to the team for helping out with GMAT preparation.

																			by score report","Points","Location","I purchased e-GMAT online course and went through its quant section. I completed about 75% of the quant course before I tried my hands on Scholaranium (e-GMAT's quizzing platform). I got most of the medium and easy questions correct but I couldn't do the hard and very hard ones. From what I read, to get over the 700 mark, I need to get hard questions correct most of the time and because I struggled with most hard questions I decided to switch to another quant prep course. I am not saying that e-GMAT quant course is bad. I felt like the course assumes that you already know the basic quantitative principles (which I almost completely forgot since high school) and go onto more complicated questions relatively quickly. I believe that many people will find it useful if they are already scoring in the Q45+ range.
Although I didn't finish its quant course, I still think that e-GMAT's verbal course was well worth the time and money. Its course structure was very easy to follow and I like how the course separates the OG questions into sub-sections (e.g. Modifiers, S/V for SC, Strengthen, Weaken for CR). With this structure, you can go through each sub-section and see which ones you struggle with. This will allow you to later target those weaknesses and improve on it. Since I scored 90th percentile on RC in my diagnostic, I didn't focus as much on RC as SC and CR. For CR, I believe that the pre-thinking approach is very helpful since it will allow you to have an answer in mind and all you need is to find it in the answer choices. For SC, the application files and concept files in e-GMAT are very helpful because they contain detailed explanation and they teach you how to approach each question. I finished the SC and CR modules in e-GMAT and improve my skills through scholaranium.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","When I decided to the GMAT, i didn't really have to research the prep provider too much. I knew someone who had prepared using the e-GMAT online course and scored 700+, so it was a natural choice for me. 

That being said, what I found really useful in the course is the way the topics are structured, they really help build the concepts from the ground up and at no point does it feel like there is leap which leaves you with a conceptual gap. And the quizzes in scholaranium ensure that you can check your understanding at each milestone as you go along.  

The study planner is another great tool that is provided by e-GMAT platform, it helped me set concrete and achievable targets that i could aim for. This helped me not only stay on track but also course correct if i deviated. 

The personalized support from e-GMAT team is an added bonus. In the two weeks before the test, they asked me to focus my efforts on the 80% of topics that I already covered instead of fretting over the 20% that I hadn't. I believe that went a long way in improving my results.

I can't compare any other prep provider to e-GMAT because I didn't use any other material, except the OG guides and official mocks. But what I can say is that at no point during my preparation did i feel the need for additional resources.

																			by score report","Points","Location","EGMAT Verbal is way ahead of other verbal courses out there. Their videos and concept quizzes always helps you improve. Their Scholaranium platform is very efficient to cement the concepts learnt during concept files. The step by step process brings a sense of calm to otherwise all-over-the-place kind of preparation that sometimes people tend to do. The steps are easy to follow even by people prepping for their first attempt. Their CR is the best followed by RC and then SC. I had previously finished Manhattan Prep SC which is as good as EGMAT, hence did not pay much attention to EGMAT's SC course. Contrary to popular belief their prethinking method helps not only in CR but also in RC and SC.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","1","1","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","EGMAT’s quant section is not for GMAT. There topic is way off-board. The language of the questions was rubbish …. Total was of time. Save your money for TTP, Math revolution or Crack verbal.
For Verbal they have a decent Sentence Correction course. You will actually gain something here. But again I would say go for Manahattan books and Ron videos.
Critical reasoning section: I think CR section is also decent. But the whole experience is too slow.
RC section: Good luck if you actually save time with the above gibberish.
In summary, they have great marketing people. But the course is too slow and quant is way off target.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","1","0","","","","","",""

																			by gmat club tests","Points","Instructor","e-GMAT helped me change my perspective towards verbal. 
The kind of process that is followed to understand and answer a question is amazing. The SC course is amazing! The concepts were explained methodically and from the basics. 
Short Quizzes for assessing the weaknesses and conceptual gaps was one key aspect that helped me throughout my preparation.

The best part of the course was scholaranium . It has all levels of question from low difficulty to high and one can customize the type of questions they prefer to attempt based on their level of preparation at that point in time. 

On a whole, one who wants to ace GMAT can choose e-GMAT with 100% confidence.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","2","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","Points","Location","e-GMAT's approach towards each of the Verbal section is methodical, an approach that suits the kind of learner I'm. For someone such as me, for whom things are not obvious from the start, e-GMAT's detailed lessons and step by step process to solve questions helped me to gain subject insights, and thus to score better. Not only are the questions finely constructed to develop familiarity with various situations that are tested in GMAT, but also adaptive in nature to guide a student to improve by building fundamentals of concepts in a gradual way. e-GMAT made me believe that it's possible to achieve a great score by constantly helping me improve beyond my imagined limits. Therefore, I highly recommend this course.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","0","0","","","","","",""

																			by score report","","Location","I had a time constraint of one month to prepare for the GMAT, but the advantage was that I could devote all my time towards preparation. I picked e-GMAT after seeing many successful reviews on gmatclub. 
I opted for the e-GMAT GMAT online package. I scored a 710 on the GMAT.

The e-GMAT verbal course is really good in my opinion. The approach to sentence correction is very fundamentally strong and its application is well explained. The critical reasoning section is solid as well. The pre-thinking approach helped streamline my thoughts towards the exact question and eliminate all incorrect options. The reading comprehension slides however appeared to be outdated, maybe it could do with a re-do to make it at par with the other two sections.

The quant section is where I have my gripe though. The concept files and the application files were very basic. The explanations given in these files were often hard to apply on hard questions without a prior strong level of fundamentals in math. I feel the quant section could be improved a lot.

Scholaranium was a really helpful tool with its vast question bank. I got ample practice in verbal, and thorough analysis on my weaker areas. The quant scholaranium was very good as well, but I didn't use it as much as verbal.

The Sigma-X mocks were great. I would recommend this to anyone studying for their GMAT. The level of score analysis presented at the end of the exam makes it very clear on how to improve oneself.

Overall, I think it is a good course, but I'm not blown away by the content to be honest.","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","0","0","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/css_2/review/verify-zero-posts.svg","This reviewer has not participated on GMAT Club but it is a REAL

																			by gmat club tests","","Location","One of the most popular recommended courses
For the pricing the layout of the content feels very “cheap” and cumbersome to use e.g. cannot play videos at different speeds. On the contrary listening to the content at the normal speed does ensure you do not listen too fast and miss important details
Verbal provides a good foundation for content however much of the terminology used is abbreviated/categorised in their own form and comparing this with other providers terminology can lead to some confusion
EGMAT have their own question banks but style of questions is different to official source. The course is also prepared by non native English speakers and mistakes are noticeable in both the content and questions
Recommendations would be to use verbal for a basis for learning content as it goes into granular detail on the different grammar components. The proprietary question banks allow focus on weaker topic areas however given they are not representative of official questions, even moreso then other providers, I would advise tapering these off prior to practicing official questions ahead of the real exam","https://gmatclub.com/reviews/e-gmat-6?page=102#","0","0","","","","","",""
